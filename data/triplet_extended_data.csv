"29 year old female, first seizure one month ago, lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby. Present deterioration of mental status.",See that? They all assume I'm a Patient because of this cane.,Perhaps youre getting a brain tumour.
So put on a white coat like the rest of us.,I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.,"Okay, lets get some perspective people its not like Im wearing a seeingeye dog coat!"
You see where the administration might have a pRoblem with that attitude.,People don't want a sick doctor.,on our policy.
Fair enough. I don't like healthy Patients. The 29 year old female!,"The one who can't talk, I liked that part.",Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
She's my cousin.,"And your cousin doesn't like the diagnosis. I wouldn't either. Brain tumor, she's gonna die, boring.","Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so shes kind of family."
No wonder you're such a renowned diagnostician. You don't need to actually know anything to figure out what's wrong.,You're the oncologist I'm just a lowly infectious disease guy.,Well what do I know?
"Hah, yes, just a simple country doctor. Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely.",She's 29. WhatEver she's got is highly unlikely.,"Oh, shes a doctor."
Protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative.,That's an HMO lab you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.,"You know, deepsea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage."
No family history.,I thought your uncle died of cancer.,I have no other family.
Other side. No environmental factors.,That you know of.,Where? Dark side or light side?
And she's not responding to radiation treatment.,None of which is Even close to dispositive. All it does is raise one question. Your cousin goes to an HMO?,"Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?"
It's a lesion.,And the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island. I was hoping for something a bit more creative.,"Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really dont know what that is."
Shouldn't we be speaking to the Patient before we start diagnosing?,Is she a doctor?,Why dont we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
"Is she a doctor? No, but!",Everybody lies.,What kind of doctor is she?
Isn't treating Patients why we became doctors?,"No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors, treating Patients is what makes most doctors miserable.","No, Im no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person."
So you're trying to eliminate the huManity from the practice of medicine.,"If we don't talk to them they can't lie to us, and we can't lie to them. HuManity is overrated. I don't think it's a tumor.","Are you saying that Im forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?"
First year of medical school if you hear hoof beats you think horses not zebras.,Are you in first year of medical school?,"Ahem, Horse heart surgeon."
"Aneurysm, stroke, or some other ischemic syndrome.",Get her a contrast MRI.,Theyre running tests.
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. Mad cow?,Mad zebra.,"Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?"
Mad zebra. Wernickie's encephalopathy?,"No, blood thiamine lEvel was normal.",I dont know!
"Lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood test. I assume it's a corollary if people lie, that people screw up.",Re-draw the blood tests. And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP. Let's find out what kind of zebra we're dealing with here.,Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they werent?
I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.,"Really? Well, that's odd, because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago.","Can I please see you in my office, please?"
You think we have nothing to talk about?,"No, just that I can't think of anything that I'd be interested in.",What are we supposed to talk about?
I sign your paychecks.,"I have tenure. Are you going to grab my cane now, stop me from leaving?","Oh, I just need your signature on this."
I can still fire you if you're not doing your job.,I'm here from 9 to 5.,"No, you cant fire me."
Your billings are practically nonexistent.,Rough year.,I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
You ignore requests for consults.,I call back. Sometimes I misdial.,You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
You're 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic.,"See, I was right, this doesn't interest me.",What is the great tragedy here?
"6 years, times 3 weeks you owe me better than 4 months.",It's 500. I'm going home.,Six years and two months.
I'm going home. To what?,Nice.,Im goin home.
"Look, Dr. House, the only reason that I don't fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.","Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You aren't going to fire me.","Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok?"
Your reputation won't last up if you don't do your job. The clinic is part of your job. I want you to do your job.,"Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, You can't always get what you want.",Okay. Yknow what? Id have to say I really dont care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa! Oh gosh! Whoa!
"Dr. Cameron. I'm sorry I have to stop you, there's a pRoblem.",You pulled my authorization.,"Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?"
"Yes, why are you yelling?","No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs.",Why are you yelling at me?
You also can't make long distance phone calls.,If you're gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me.,"Anyway, we can email, and I think the phone connections are pretty good."
Or photocopies you're still yelling.,I'm ANGRY! You're risking a Patient's life.,"Uh, boss, were out of paper."
I assume those are two separate points.,"You showed me disrespect, you embarrassed me and as long as I'm still work here you have!interrupted",Youre exactly right and you get a point.
"Oh, I looked into that philosopher you quoted, Jagger, and you're right, You can't always get what you want, but as it turns out if you try sometimes you get what you need.","So, because you want me to treat Patients, you aren't letting me treat Patients.","Huh. Well, you know, you cant have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for whats most important. Thats my new thing."
I need you to do your job.,"Do the MRI, she folded.",I need you.
Just get some rest for now.,"Told you, can't trust people.","Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids."
"She pRobably knew she was allergic to gadolinium, figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.","Can't get a picture, gonna have to get a thousand words.",As a matter of fact she said thats how I am going to die.
You actually want me to talk to the Patient? Get a history?,We need to know if there's some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response.,"Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?"
I thought Everybody lied?,Truth begins in lies. Think about it.,I didnt lie.
"That doesn't mean anything,does it?","1252 PM Dr. House checks in, please write that down. Do you have cable TV here somewhere? General Hospital starts in 8 minutes.",How is being a weakness a compliment?
"No TV, but we've got Patients.",Can't you give out the aspirin yourself? I'll do paperwork.,"Im sorry, I dont own a TV."
I made sure your first case was an interesting one.,"Cough just won't go away, runny nose looks a funny color.","Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so"
Patient admitted complaining of back spasms.,I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.,Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Patient is orange.,The color?,This is a hospital.
"No, the fruit.",You mean yellow it's jaundice.,"You said fruit, Michael."
I mean orange.,"Well, how orange?","No, orange is whorish."
What's that? What are you doing?,Painkillers.,What... Whats that? Whatcha doing?
"Oh, for you, for your leg.","No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better.","By the way, my leg is killing me."
"No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better.","Unfortunately, you have a deeper pRoblem. Your wife is having an affair.","Nono, II just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself."
Your wife is having an affair. What?!,"You're orange, you moron!",Your wife says you have something important to tell me.
"You're orange, you moron! It's one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, she's just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?","The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good Lawyer.","Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day."
"The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good Lawyer.",Deep breath.,Feel free to retain a lawyer.
Deep breath. It's cold.,Has he been using his inhaler?,Im breathing heavily.
What happened to your leg?,"Your doctor pRobably was concerned about the strength of the medicine, too.","Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
What? The more often this happens!what?,"Forget it. If you don't trust steroids, you shouldn't trust doctors.","Yes, and this happens every."
You couldn't have knocked?,"Steroids. Give her steroids, high doses of prednisone.",You knocked more than usual.
Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare. Especially for someone her age.,So is a tumor. Her SED rate was elevated.,Im afraid the situation is much worse than we expected.
"That could mean anything, or nothing.","Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that it's vasculitus except that it could be.","Um, not everything means something, its just a joke."
You can't diagnose that without a biopsy.,"Yes, we can, we treat it. If she gets better we know that we're right.",The doctor will be right with you sir.
And if we're wrong?,We learn something else.,But what if Im wrong?
Parrots are the primary source of psitticosis.,It's not the parrot.,"Well, you cant get diseases from a bird!"
Psitticosis can lead to nerve pRoblems and neurological complications.,How Many kids were there in the class?,"I know, but Im a neurologist."
How Many kids were there in the class? 20,How Many are home sick?,Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
"How Many are home sick? None, but!","None, but you think that 5 year olds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher. You've been through her home?","IIm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I dont feel very good."
She lives in Trenton. I can go up to her room tomorrow morning and ask her for the key.,Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene?,Is there a key for Jane Doe?
It's not a crime scene.,Far as I know she's running a Meth Lab out of her basement.,Hes right. Cops cant do anything until a crime has been reported.
She's a kindergarten teacher!,And if I was a Kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly.,"Oh, is she that teacher in the white?"
"Whoa, oh, I can't just break into someone's House.",Isn't that how you got into the Felker's home?,How? I guess I could break down your door.
I should thank him?,"Well, I needed somebody around here with street smarts. Ok? Knows when you're being conned, knows how to con.","Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you."
I should sue you!,I'm pretty sure you can't sue somebody for wrongful hiring.,Youll see me in small claims court!
But I'm pretty sure I can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some lady's House.,I'm doing research. People are fascinating aren't they?,You know what the best part about this is?
Why are you giving Adler steroids?,"Well, she's my Patient that's what you do with Patients. You give them medicine.","Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?"
You don't prescribe medicine based on guesses. At least we don't since Tuskeegee and Mengele.,You're comparing me to a Nazi? Nice.,And based on the fact that Mr.
I'm stopping the treatment.,She's my Patient.,Are you quitting?
It's my hospital.,"I did not get her sick, she is not an experiment, I have a legitimate theory about what's wrong with her.",I knew it.
With no proof.,There's nEver any proof. 5 different doctors come up with 5 different diagnoses based on the same evidence.,"No, but there are other ways of providing proof."
You don't have any evidence. And nobody knows anything huh? Then how is it that you always assume you're right?,"I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption. And why are you so afraid of making a mistake?","Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like."
Because I'm a doctor. Because when we make mistakes people die.,Come on.,Im a doctor.
Because when we make mistakes people die. Come on.,People used to have more respect for cripples you know! Turns to a guy in a wheelchair They didn't really.,Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Thank him for me. Right.,"Should I discontinue the treatment, boss?",Dont everyone thank me at once.
You got lucky.,"Cool, huh?",So you just got lucky?
"Given the latest symptoms it's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem. Soon she won't be able to walk, she'll go blind perManently, and then the respiratory center will fail.",How long do we have?,"If she can just hang on for a little while longer, Ithis will be so huge for our family."
"If it's a tumor we're talking a month, maybe two, if it's infectious a few weeks, if it's vascular that'll pRobably be fastest of all, maybe a week.",We're gonna stop all treatment.,No more than a week.
"Well, maybe we didn't see the effects until we started steroids.","No, it's not a tumor. The steroids did something, I just don't know what.","The Pharmacology Department controls that, and theyre all hopped up on experimental steroids."
So we're just gonna do nothing? We're just gonna watch her die?,"Yeah, we're gonna watch her die.",Well keep her alive.
"There's go to be something we can do, something better than watParkng her die.","Well, I got nothing. How 'bout you?",There must be something we can do.
I'm tired a lot.,Any other reason you think you may have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?,"I just feel kind of tired, you know."
It's kinda the definition isn't it?,It's kinda the definition of getting older.,"Sure. Basically, theres no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem."
"I had a couple headaches last month, mild fEver, sometimes I can't sleep, and I have trouble concentrating.",Apparently not while researParkng this stuff on the internet.,My head hurts and Im more tired than ever.
I was thinking it also might be fibromyalgia.,"Looks contemplative, and then serious Excellent diagnosis sarcastic!","Ooh, its sympathy pains."
Is there anything for that?,"heavy sigh Ya know, I think there just might be.","Well, is there anything I could do to help?"
"heavy sigh Ya know, I think there just might be.","I need 36 Vicodin, and change for a dollar.","Yeah... yeah, I think there is. What were you gonna say?"
"jumbled, I can't tell",Exam room 2. Places the bottle back on the counter.,Not that kind of confused.
Did you stab a guy in a bar fight? Nothing.,It's not a tumor she's getting worse too fast. She can't stand up.,"Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off."
Not that I could tell from her underwear drawer.,You said nothing that would explain these symptoms. What did you find that doesn't explain these symptoms?,"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does."
"Yes, yes, her name is Rebecca. I call her Rachel.",You idiot!,Her names Rebecca.
You idiot! Hey!listen!,"Not you, him! You said you didn't find anything.","What? Hey, hey, listen.."
Everything I found was in interrupted,You found ham.,Im sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
You found ham. So?,"Where there's ham there's pork, where there's pork there's neurocysticercosis.","You mean, like a ham?"
Tapeworm?! You think she's got a worm in her brain?,"It fits. Could have been living there for years, it nEver occurred to me interrupted",Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
Millions of people eat ham Every day. It's quite a leap to think that she's got a tapeworm.,"OK, Mr. Neurologist. What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?",Are you sure that you didnt eat bacon?
Just like Rebecca Adler did.,In a typical case if you don't cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae.,And I intend to help her do it.
"Reproduce? There's only got one lesion, and it's nowhere near her bowel.","That's because this is not a typical case. Tapeworm can produce 20 to 30,000 eggs a day. Guess where they go.","Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it."
Guess where they go. Out.,"Not all of them. Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines and into the blood stream. And where does the blood stream go?","Okay. Nope. Thats it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out."
And where does the blood stream go? Everywhere.,As long as it's healthy the immune system doesn't Even know it's there.,Dont think of it that way.
"As long as it's healthy, so what do we do? Call a vet and nurse the little guy back to health?",It's too late for that.,"Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate."
It's only abnormal in 30% of cases. Proving nothing.,"No, no, no, no, you see, it fits, it's perfect! It explains Everything.",I dont think thats very common.
But it proves nothing.,I can prove it by treating it.,"Oh, quite sure."
"No, you can't. I was just with her, she doesn't want any more treatments, she doesn't want any more experiments, she wants to go home and die.","To nurse Will you excuse us, please?",I have nowhere else to go.
"To nurse Will you excuse us, please?",I'm Dr. House.,Do you want me to get the nurse?
It's good to meet you.,"You're being an idiot. Ahem. Pause You have a tapeworm in your brain, it's not pleasant, but if we don't do anything you'll be dead by the weekend.",Does it smell like blueberries?
Have you actually seen the worm?,When you're all better I'll show you my diplomas.,Have you ever met the Blackfish?
You were sure I had vasculitus too. Now I can't walk and I'm wearing a,"I'm not talking about a treatment I'm talking about a cure. But because I might be wrong, you want to die.","I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic."
What made you a cripple?,I had an infarction.,Im not a cripple.
A heart attack?,It's what happens when the blood flow is obstructed.,"Asthma, heart, some kind of attack."
Wasn't there something they could do?,"There was plenty they could do, if they made the right diagnosis, but the only symptom was pain. Not may people get to experience muscle death.","There wasnt. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?"
Did you think you were dying?,I hoped I was dying.,You think about dying?
"So you hide in your office, refuse to see Patients because you don't like the way people look at you. You feel cheated by life so now you're gonna get Even with the world. You want me to fight this. Why? What makes you think I'm so much better than you?","When you're scared, you'll turn into me.",Why dont you stand up to them?
I just want to die with a little dignity.,There's no such thing!,DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
"There's no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we're 90, sometimes before we're Even born, but it always happens and there's nEver any dignity in it. I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It's always ugly, always. Pause You can live with dignity, we can't die with it.",No treatment.,Until nothing is left of you but bones!
"Maybe we can get a court order, override her wishes. Claim she doesn't have the capacity to make this decision.",But she does.,She doesnt get to choose.
Pretty common result.,That didn't happen here.,Ive never seen results like this before.
"So because you respect her, you're going to let her die?","I solved the case, my work is done.","Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death."
"I solved the case, my work is done.","Patients always want proof, we're not making cars here, we don't give guarantees.",The problem appears to be unsolvable.
"I think we can prove it's a worm. It's noninvasive, it's safe. I'm not completely sure but!interrupted","Yeah, yeah, yeah what's the damn idea?",Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
"Which is the same thing as a CT scan, which we did, which proved nothing.","Worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid, we're not going to see anything in her head, but Chase is right, he's right, we should x-ray her, but we don't x-ray her brain, we x-ray her leg, worms love thigh muscle.",Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Why did you hire me?,Does it matter?,Why do you wanna work here?
Kinda hard to work for a guy who doesn't respect you.,Why?,You dont want to work for a guy like that.
Is that rhetorical?,"No, it just seems that way because you can't think of an answer.",Why are you such a stupid head?
You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.,"No, it wasn't a racial thing, I didn't see a black guy.","Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines."
You hired me to get into my pants?!,I can't beliEve that that would shock you.,But I hired you!
I was in the top of my class.,But not THE top.,I was allcounty my junior and senior years.
I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.,"Yes, you were a very good applicant.",I went to medical school.
But not the best?,"Would that upset you, really, to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence?","Its not the best Best Western Ive been to, but Id say its the third best Best Western Ive been to."
I worked very hard to get where I am.,But you didn't have to.,You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
Am I supposed to be flattered?,Gorgeous women do not go to medical school. Unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful. Were you abused by a family member?,Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering?
Were you abused by a family member? No!,Sexually assaulted?,"Oh, Im sorry."
Sexually assaulted? No.,"But you are damaged, aren't you?",I was raped.
Hold on. She's converted.,You said she was your cousin. Why would you lie?," talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting."
It got you to take the case.,"You lied to a friend to save a stranger, you don't think that's screwed up?",You took something that doesnt belong to you.
You've nEver lied to me?,I NEveR lie.,"Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me."
He says he needs a refill.,Got change for a dollar?,Do you want a refill?
"Dan, Dan, get a doctor! Hey!",Close the door. Close the door!,"Ross, seriously! Youve gotta go to an appropriate doctor."
Is Cuddy down the hall counting to 50?,"She's knows I'm in here, the clinic, as she comManded she just doesn't know I'm alone.","Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?"
"Well, you've got a full waiting room, how long do you think you can ignore them?",I'm off at 400.,"And you should take breaks more often, Ive been waiting there for 45 minutes."
You're doing this to avoid 5 minutes of work?,"I go out there, I get assigned a kid with a runny nose.",Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?
"Yes, concerned parents can be so annoying. Just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent case, you had to leave early.",That would be lying.,"Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die."
"And that would be wrong. But luckily, the definition of urgent is fungible.",Not the definition of case though.,"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
"You have no cases. You have NO cases. You've got handpicked doctors, specialists, working for you, and they're sitting on their hands?",Cameron is answering my mail.,"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition wont receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff."
Time well spent I'm sure. Foreman and Chase?,Research?,Greg Malins Adam Chase
Huh Fills in the space,"So, 403 PM. Dr. House checks out. Please write that down.",Huh? Ooh you mean like a Huh?
Dr. House. from now on he'll just be called Dad,"Sorry, done for the day. There's plenty of docs here to take care of you.","Dad, he wants to be called snowball."
But we had an appointment.,"Hah, nice try, but this is a walk-in clinic, which means there are no appointments.","So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it."
But your letter says that we would see you.,Not a big letter writer.,I wrote you a letter.
Not a big letter writer. Here.,When did my signature get so girly?,Ive been drafting a letter.
I can explain.,"See that G, see how it makes a big loop on top?",Oh. You could tell it to me.
"It's impossible to get to you through normal channels, they have called!interrupted",PersEverance does not equal worthiness. Next time you want to get my attention wear something fun. Low-rider jeans are hot.,"If youd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first."
"16 year old male, sudden onset of double vision and night terrors, with no apparent cause. The kid's been to 2 neurologists!interrupted","Night terrors, yeah? As in big scary monsters?",Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
Where are you going?,To see the family.,"Anyway, Dads gonna be here in town, so I wont be able to do Christmas dinner this year."
You're going to examine a Patient?,"9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a Patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family.","A doctors office, Rachel is on an examining table with her legs in the stirrups."
"9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a Patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family. Good work.","Margins look fine. No lesions, color is good. How long have you been having night terrors?","Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things."
What does that tell you?,"Nothing, it's just fun watParkng him blink. To Dan Name as Many animals as you can that begin with the letter B go.","Anyway, Dads gonna be here in town, so I wont be able to do Christmas dinner this year."
To Dan Name as Many animals as you can that begin with the letter B go. Baby elephant.,Baby elephant is actually a good answer B is a bear of a letter.,"Excuse me. If were changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo."
What does that tell you?,"Proves two things, no neurological damage, and your son is nEver going to be Parkef fry cook.",Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
"In teens there are two likely causes of night terrors post traumatic stress, any recent shootouts at your high school? No.","Well, then, Dave!","Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil thats been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?"
"Well, then, Dave! Dan",!if there's no trauma the other cause is sexual abuse.,"Hi, Dave. Uh, its Amy."
We would nEver do anything to hurt Dan.,"I say it here, it comes out there. This lack of response is consistent with abuse.","Yeah. All right, Im gonna go tell Dan that its not gonna happen. Dont do the dance."
"There's no one, ok? I swear. There was trauma I got hit in the head during a lacrosse game.",To Cameron Did you know that he got hit in the head?,"Oh, I know Im going to regret this but, what trauma?"
"They didn't mention it, no.","Yeah, why bother.","No, she never mentioned it."
"No, no, we took him to the ER after the game. He was scanned, they tested him, they said he was fine. No concussion, it's gotta be something else.","You hound me for my opinion and then question my diagnosis. Cool. ER obviously screwed up, kid's got a concussion.","Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because Im pretty sure he has a concussion."
I had double vision before I got hit.,"Well, that changes Everything, you need glasses.","Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?"
"You enjoyed that. I brought a reasonable case to your attention, and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me.","You're an only Parkld, aren't you?","Well, you defended me, right?"
Why would you say that?,Everything is about you.,Things have been generally good.
I'm not an only Parkld.,attention on Dan Interesting.,The park huh?
attention on Dan Interesting. What?,Don't move. Did I bore you in there?,"Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?"
"What? Ah, no, not, not really.",Are you tired?,"Uh, no. Nope. Not really."
He nEver sleeps! Of course he's tired.,"Right now, at this moment, are you tired?","You better believe hes tired, after the day we had!"
"Right now, at this moment, are you tired? No, no.",That twitch in your leg. Did you feel that?,Whyre you so tired?
His leg twitched. I don't see what!interrupted,"It's called a myoclonic jerk, it's very common when you're falling asleep.",Something just moves past my leg!
"Respiration rate falls, and the brain interprets this as the body dying, so it sends a pulse to wake it up. So?","So, he's not asleep, he's awake. Turns to Cameron Admit him.","Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we dont get enough REM sleep?"
"So, he's not asleep, he's awake. Turns to Cameron Admit him.","I recognize that loopy G. So, what does the jerk tell us?","Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first."
"Nothing good, the brain's losing control of the body. Can't order the eyes to focus, regulate sleep patterns or control muscle movements.","A movement disorder, or degenerative brain disease. Either way this kid's gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair.",A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy.
"Maybe not that bad, could be an infection.","You wish. No fEver, no white count. Anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we don't have an accurate family history?","I think you just have a cold, its definitely not Strep."
I took an accurate family history.,You didn't Even take an accurate family. His father's not his father.,"Uh, he took the SATs for me."
Why would you say that?,30% of all dads out there don't realize they're raising someone else's kid.,"Hi. Sorry Im late, I was at an audition."
From what I've read false paternity is more like 10%.,That's what our moms would like us to beliEve.,Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
"Who cares? If he got it from his parents they'd both be dead by now, can we get on with the differential diagnosis?",Fifty bucks says I'm right.,"We dont know, his mother never had him tested."
I'll take your money.,"Hit a nerve? Don't worry, Foreman. I'm sure the guy who tucked you in at night was your daddy.","Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like."
"It doesn't necessarily have to be that bad. If we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic his liver, kidneys, something outside the brain.","Yes, feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier.","A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?"
That's a night terror. Parents said?,That's a good point.,Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
I usually don't move during night terrors.,I'm not restraining you for them. EEG rEvealed abnormalities in your brain caused by nerve damage in your toes.,Can you guarantee that it wont happen at any time during the night?
Whimpering What are you doing?,Fixing it.,Whats up?
Still whimpering Can I talk to my parents?,"Oh, they know all about this.","Yeah, I really dont want to talk about my parents now."
I'd really like to see them. Whimpering after pause Please! I'd really like them here.,"This is gonna hurt, Dan.",Would you like to see them?
"We did a CT, MRI, CBC, Chem-7 and chest x-ray. All the tests came back normal. There's nothing to explain his symptoms.","Ok, but let's pretend there's something and go from there. Who sees something on this MRI?","Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan."
No space-occupying tumors.,"He's 16, so he should have an absolutely pristine brain. The smallest thing is abnormal.","What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer."
Meningeal enhancement. My bet is viral meningitis.,"Excellent, you see what he did there? He took a small clue that there's a neurological pRoblem and wasn't afraid to run with it.","Possible Tourettes. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock."
There's no evidence of meningitis on that MRI.,"No, there's not, he's completely wrong.","Yup, theres no inflammation at all, Sheldon."
Then what clue are you talking about?,"He knew that I saw something on the MRI so he figured there must be something there and took a guess. ClEver, but also pathetic.","Ooh. Okay, lets hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear."
"So, what did you find?",Take a close look at the corpus callosum.,Can we see that?
It looks ok.,"Are we all looking at the same thing? 200 million interhemispheric nerve fibers, the George Washington Bridge between the left and right side of the brain. It's subtle.","Just like Schrodingers Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad."
"There's some bowing, there. An upward arch.",Are you guessing?,Did you just bow?
Are you guessing? Yes.,"Too bad, you're right.",No. It was just a guess.
"He pRobably just moved, nobody stays perfectly still for their entire MRI.","Yeah, he pRobably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position. Something is pushing on it.","Oh, and also, hes, hes walkin kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and hes in there just sort of yknow."
If there's bowing it could be a tumor.,Do you see a tumor on this MRI?,"Well, he said theres definitely nothing to worry about, its totally benign."
"No, but I don't see any bowing, either.","There's no tumor, just a blockage causing pressure, causing symptoms. Today",You need legs to work a bow.
"No more pressure, Everything goes back to normal.",He's lucky to have you as his doctors.,You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
"No formula, just mommy's healthy natural breast milk.",Yummy.,I got bottled breast milk.
Her whole face just got swollen like this overnight.,"Mmhmm. No fEver, glands normal, missing her vaccination dates.",Shes probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
"Takes a toy frog and starts to make frog sounds Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. Giggles",Think they don't work?,"Whats green and says hey, Im a frog?"
I think some multinational pharmaceutical company wants me to think they work. Pad their bottom line.,Mmmm. May I? He takes the frog and starts to do the gribbit noise with the baby,"Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?"
He takes the frog and starts to do the gribbit noise with the baby Whispered Sure.,"Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit.",Hes talking to the baby.
"Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. The baby laughs All natural, no dyes. That's a good business all-natural Parkldren's toys. Those toy companies, they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs. They don't lie about how much they spend on research and dEvelopment. The worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog.","Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit.",The little choochoo for toddlers?
Tell me what she has.,A cold.,You have more than she does.
There's a pRoblem.,Complications in surgery?,Weve got a problem.
"Surgery went fine, he's in recovery, but we took a vial of CSF and tested it.",Really?,The infection no longer appears to be active.
"Oligoclonal bands, and an increase of intrathecal IGG.",Which means multiple sclerosis. And the reason it takes three of you to tell me this?,"OK, well, if youve never been sick, then you dont have any antibodies."
McDonald criteria requires six months to make a definitive diagnosis.,"Oh, who cares about McPherson? I hear he tortured kittens.",They said it could be up to a year.
I hear he tortured kittens. McDonald.,"Oh, McDonald. Wonderful doctor, loved kittens.",Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Without the lesions we can't be sure.,"Well if it is, it's gone from 0 to 60 in three weeks, which would indiCate rapidly progressive MS.",We dont know what could make this go away.
We should wait until we interrupted,"Start treating him now, he can walk for another couple of years, maybe live for another 5. Break it to the family. I'm going home.","At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic."
I'm not here. Leave a message.,"Dr. Cuddy, great outfit.",Im sorry. Im not here.
What are you doing back here? Patient?,"No, hooker. Went to my office instead of my home.",Whatre you doing back there?
"Dr. House, Dan's missing.","Yeah, I got that part from the message. You said I was needed immediately.","Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that were gonna be going out with on Saturday."
He shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.,"I agree, he's gonna have a very nasty headache. That would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning.","Its okay, its not as bad as it looks, its a precaution."
We wanted to keep you informed. He heard some pretty heavy news.,Sighs This is not a toddler wandering around a department store. He's 16. You'll find him. I'm going home.,I wanted to make sure were doing everything we can to get him back.
"So, when you say Call me if you need anything, You mean, Don't call me.","No, I mean Call me if I can do something. I'm bad at search parties and I'm bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing.","Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us."
What about his parents? Should we call them?,Why? You think they're hiding him? Make sure someone checks the roof some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke.,Hi. Were the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Dan! Dan! No!,Dr. Foreman. I assume you found the kid.,"Hey, tell Dan, Thanks."
He almost walked off the roof.,Suicidal?,He had to board.
"No, he thought he was on his lacrosse field. Look, look, I was just gonna run home, shower, change!interrupted",Conscious?,I think metaphorically.
Conscious? Yeah.,How'd you talk him down?,It would be better if you were unconscious.
"Actually, Chase tackled him.",How come you didn't do it?,He ran... Not very fast.
"Right, well, I am black, but he was closer.","Come on, you can ride up with me.","Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasnt racist. Hes also brown."
"Come on, you can ride up with me.",Anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof? They must be thrilled.,"All right, lets get me back up there!"
"They're not suing, but I think only because Chase asked them.",Why does Everyone always think I'm being sarcastic?,"Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit."
Why doesn't he have MS?,"He was on the roof thinking he was on the lacrosse field, conscious, and therefore not a night terror. You want some of this? Asking Foreman about the coffee","All I know, Mummy, is that hes a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, theres no money for your little boy."
"Asking Foreman about the coffee Yeah, sure.","He was in an acute confusional state, which doesn't fit with a demyelinating disease like MS.","Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?"
That the immune system is working.,"Right, he has an infection in his brain.","My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressurefree, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall."
What about sex?,"Well, it might get compliCated. We work together. I am older, certainly, but maybe you like that.","Sex? Really? I mean, thats just your solution to everything."
I meant maybe he has neurosyphilis.,"Heh, nice cover.",I have an eidetic memory.
"Sorry, RPR was negative.",We don't need a definitive test to confirm this.,I am not pr
"Sure, didn't need one to confirm MS.","Ok, let's wait for you to run titers on 4000 viruses while this kid's brain turns to mush.","No. Cause you need that. No, its okay, thanks."
"So the fact that he doesn't have MS is, it's really not good news after all?","Well, it is if it's neurosyphilis, the likelihood of a false negative on an RPR test, 30%, the likelihood of a 16 year old having sex, roughly 120%.","But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
I'll start him on IV penicillin.,We're not going to wait for that. The most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine.,"Yes, Id like a sevenday course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint."
"We can't. In a cramped space like the brain, increased intracranial pressure from a high-volume drug like penicillin could herniate his brain stem and kill him. No neurologist in his right mind would recommend that.",Show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?,has become the penicillin of the twentyfirst century.
Show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?,And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?,Cant I just agree without putting my hand in?
And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?,Who thinks there's a third option?,"Well, dont get me wrong."
Who thinks there's a third option?,"Very good, what's the third choice?",Maybe theres a third option.
"Sighs The Patient has a shunt in his brain. There'll be no increased pressure, we can put as much penicillin into his body as we want.","Excellent, inject him through a lumbar puncture.",Now youre being a responsible patient.
"Sighs again, and then grunts in pain","Geesh. It's infected, with a really big hole like you stuck a nail in it to reliEve the pressure.","The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?"
I wouldn't do that.,"Although the wound is irregular, not cylindrical, it's shaped like a triangle, so not a nail. Steak knife?",Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
Wife's nail file.,"Whispered Nail File. Yeah, pain'll make you do stupid things. Something to take the edge off? Takes out his pills and puts one in his hand",A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
Takes out his pills and puts one in his hand Yeah.,Cheers. Dry swallows the pill and Funsten eats his ewwwww Limps back,His right hand is calling him?
Dry swallows the pill and Funsten eats his ewwwww Limps back No.,Here on work?,Hes going to swallow is tongue.
"No, why are you interrupted",Does your penis hurt?,Im sorry to interrupt you.
No. What? Should it?,"No, just thought I'd toss you a really inappropriate question. Your Lawyer's gonna love it.",No... I think its a great idea.
Why would I want to sue you? I want you to treat me.,"You're from Maplewood, New Jersey. Right?","Guess what, I have flaws."
Right? Yeah.,"Now, why would you drive 70 miles to get treatment for a condition that a 9 year old could diagnose? It's the free-flowing pus that's the tip-off.","Anyway, Dads gonna be here in town, so I wont be able to do Christmas dinner this year."
I was in town.,"Not for family, not for work.","Yes, I was there."
"Ok, you know what? Thank you, I'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this.","I didn't say I wouldn't treat you. We'll drain your knee, run some lab work, fix you right up.","Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?"
Why would you do that?,I'm a people person.,"Yes. Im sorry, master. Forgive me. I didnt think"
You actually treated him?,"All I know is that he sued some doctors, who am I to assume that they didn't have it coming to them.","He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away."
How's your hooker doing?,"Oh, sweet of you to ask, funny story, she was going to be a hospital administrator, but hated having to screw people like that.","Thats not how you see me, is it?"
I heard you found her on the roof.,You have very acute hearing.,Im pretty sure I put her on my bed.
You notify the parents?,"In due course, of course.","Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter."
And is there a paternity bet on the father of the Patient?,Doesn't sound like me.,I dont think the next patient is very far along.
"Well, it does actually, but that doesn't mean you're guilty.",You think?,"Yeah, it does, actually."
"I saw the parents in the lobby, smart money is obviously on the father.",Stage whisper My guy knows a guy who can get you in for $50 bucks.,Who will you say is the father?
"Fine. You tell your guy if I win, you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie.","And if I win, no clinic hours for a week.","If I win, youll let me go?"
Penicillin's not working.,"So, either it's a bad batch of penicillin, or our diagnosis is wrong. Square one. Mignight.",Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
"LFTs, BUN, and creatinine, are all normal, diabetes is out. No gap.",There goes metabolic. Crosses off M,My blood work shows thyroid function normal.
MRI rules out vasculitis.,I for inflammation. Crosses out the I,Ill look on WebMD.
Too young for anything degenerative.,"D, see ya. Crosses out the D N for neoplastic?",Not as old as him.
MRI was clean.,I for inflammation.,Fine? You said it was fine?
We already did that.,Stupid to have two I's in one mneumonic. What's the other one?,"We, we can totally do that."
CT scan rules out subdural.,"Trauma, later much.","Uhh, cause, uhh, Im a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage."
"Trauma, later much. Looks at the board which is now all crossed out. You know the pRoblem? Midnight is actually spelled with a G and an H, If we could just figure out what those two letters stand for. Sighs and walks away for the board. His back is now facing the ducklings It's a sick brain, having fun, torturing him, talking to him. pause Scaring the hell out of him. Get him an EEG, left and right EOG esophageal microphones. If this thing wants to talk, let's listen.",We're missing something. This is screwed up.,"Torture room, night."
That's why you came up with the brain talking to the virus thing?,"I panicked, ok? Sounded cool though, they bought it.",I see what youre doing.
"I panicked, ok? Sounded cool though, they bought it.","Oh, crap. Another reason I don't like meeting Patients. If they don't know what you look like they can't yell at you. Aside to Wilson Here we go.","Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And whatd they say? Thats awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!"
How can you just sit there?,"If I eat standing up, I spill.",You sit there.
"Our son is dying, and you could care less? We're going through hell you're doing nothing?","I'm sorry, you need to vent, I understand.",Why do you care so much?
Don't be condescending. You haven't checked in on him once.,"Blood pressure's 110/70, the shunt is patent well placed in the right lateral ventricle, the EKG shows a normal QRS with deep wave inversions throughout both limb and pericardial leads.",Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
"Blood pressure's 110/70, the shunt is patent well placed in the right lateral ventricle, the EKG shows a normal QRS with deep wave inversions throughout both limb and pericardial leads. LFTs are elevated but only twice the normal range. Oh yeah, and he's hearing voices. Pause Go hold his hand. Go on I'll bus your tray.",Got any sample bags on you?,"If thats a working stethoscope, maybe youd like to hear my heart skip a beat."
I don't beliEve you. You're gonna run DNA tests?,"Their son is deathly ill, I know it's terrible, but the fact is if I don't keep busy with trivial things like this I'm afraid I might start to cry.","Well, noones going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you overthink everything."
You're an ass.,Yeah? You want to double the bet?,Youre a jerk.
Yeah? You want to double the bet?,General Hospital is on channel 6.,You really wanna bet?
"Dan's brain's not showing channel 6 right now, only mush.",No epileptiform activity. Turns to Cameron What are you doing?,"Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?"
Waiting for CBC and Chem-7.,"Good, run DNA on these. He puts down two cups that are labeled Mommy and Daddy???",Im sorry there wasnt better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
He puts down two cups that are labeled Mommy and Daddy??? What's this?,Parents' coffee cups.,"but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs."
I can't beliEve you interrupted,"I've had this conversation once already. If you've got something else to do, do it. Otherwise, do this.","Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day?"
"Otherwise, do this. Dr. House?","Hey, Mr. Funsten! I was wondering when you'd be back. Got some papers for me?","Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat."
You've caused me considerable mental distress.,"I certainly hope so. Funsten hands him an envelope What? Too cheap to have your Lawyer serve it for you, or is it more fun this way?","Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself."
I'm obviously prepared to consider a settlement.,You have gonorrhea.,Ive been sent to negotiate with you.
"No, I don't!","Well, maybe you're right, but I have a lab result that says you do.","Just like Schrodingers Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad."
You're just trying to scare me.,"It's reportable you know, public health issue.",Are you trying to scare me?
I'll be sure to let my wife know.,"Oh, don't bother yourself, the state will call for you.",And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
"Oh, don't bother yourself, the state will call for you. Look, if you're clean I'm sure this will all blow over, no big deal. There's an easy way to find out, get one of your doctors to run a test.",Uh-uh. These are mine now. I'll see you in court. House enters the elevator.,Theyre just doing a background check on me.
We need an answer.,You idiots! You lied to me!,I think we have an answer.
"You, on the other hand, accused us of molesting our son. Perfect.",Can we get off my screw-ups and focus on theirs? Theirs is bigger. You're not Dan's parents.,"All right. Well, yknow in my defense I was a lousy father."
He was adopted. He doesn't need to know.,I do.,He needs to know.
Adoption makes him just as much his interrupted,"Listen, when we were taking his medical history, were you confused?","Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now hes walking around thinking, Do I want to be a dad? and then bam!"
How did you find out about this?,I sampled their DNA.,"Well, how did you know about it?"
We didn't give you any DNA.,Your coffee cups from the cafeteria.,What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?
You can't do that!,"Again, why are we getting hung up on what I did? Turns to Dan's parents Your medical history is useless.","And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
"Sounds reasonable. Well, if you want to transfer your boy that is your choice, but I still think it's the wrong interrupted","Was she vaccinated? Pause The biological mother, when she was a baby, did she get her vaccinations?","If he is your son, thats a great plan."
Dan was vaccinated at 6 months.,"Mm hmm, and do you know why kids get vaccinated at 6 months? Because before that, they are protected by their biological mother's immune system. So, was she vaccinated?","If youre really worried, well take him to the vet and have him tested."
"Mm hmm, and do you know why kids get vaccinated at 6 months? Because before that, they are protected by their biological mother's immune system. So, was she vaccinated?",An infant picks up a regular old measles virus.,My mom didnt believe in vaccines.
Sub-acute Sclerosing Pan-encephalitis.,I know. There's only been 20 cases in the United States in the past 30 years.,"Sheldon, relax, she doesnt have any symptoms, Im sure shes not contagious."
I suppose you could make an argument that the kid's still in stage one. Once SSPE moves to stage two Interrupted,"Boom, stage two is universally fatal.","Look, theres nothing I can do for him right now, hes still in his sweat pants, thats still Phase One."
I assume it's impossible to tell when he might move into stage two.,"He's already started showing symptoms. It could be a month, it could be tonight.",Stop it! Youre killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Can we treat it?,Ask the neurologist.,"If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but II think we have to just"
We're not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis.,Tap him.,"Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain."
"We won't get a reliable result for measles antibodies in his CSF, not after Everything we've given him.",So the wrong treatment kills any hope of the right diagnosis.,"We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not good."
"You can't order a $3,200 DNA test to win a bet.","It's not an actual cost. I don't know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing maParkne.","Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why havent I heard back yet?"
"I don't know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing maParkne. I'm serious.","Well, tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance.",What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. Its like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?
Insurance is not going to pay for a bet.,It should.,And Im not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
"I will let you out of clinic duty for one week, after you pay the $3,200 for the PCR test. Whoo.","Well now, there's the $100 you owe me, there's the $100 I won from Cameron, $200 I took off of Foreman, and $600 I got from Wilson. Very bitter.","Nono! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Lets see uh, well I dont want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office yknow? Oohooh, maybe they want like some of my blood oror spit or something, huh?"
I think he's gonna be fine. Thanks.,"Wheels, one-eight! Wheels!",Hes gonna be okay.
"Panting and giggling Oh, Brandon. singsongy Brandon, I know I'm good but come on. Brandon, Brandon, Brandon! Brandon is unconscious.",Why do you want me to treat this guy?,"Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?"
Blood pressure's not responding to IV fluids.,"No, no I didn't ask how you plan to con me into treating him, I asked you why YOU want me to treat him.",Are you sure you dont want to go to the emergency room?
"He's sick, I care, I'm pathetic.","There are about a billion sick people on the planet, why this one?","Look at him, caring about whats wrong with me."
Because this one's is in our emergency room.,"Ah, so it's a proximity issue. If somebody was sick in the third floor stairwell that's who we would be talking about.","Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid."
"Yes, I checked the stairwell, it's clear.","Ok then, emergency room guy it is.",The apartment stairwell.
"Wait, how was that so easy?",You know why.,Easy... you call that easy?
Blood pressure's not responding to IV fluids?,"Yeah, that's just weird.",Im feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss.
"Yeah, that's just weird.","CBC was unremarkable, abdominal CT scan didn't show anything. So, people, differential diagnosis. What's wrong with her?","At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic."
What's wrong with her? Him.,"Him, her, does it matter? Does anyone think it is a testicular pRoblem? No, so Chase!","Well, him about to find out about her."
"Nah, but then you wouldn't get the House slams a giant book in front of Foreman.","Foreman, if you're going to list all the things it's not, it might be quicker to do it alphabetically. Let's see. Absidia? Excellent. Doesn't account for any of the symptoms.","If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems."
No condition accounts for all these symptoms.,"Well, good!",Symptoms that are not your concern.
You're half an hour late.,Busy case load.,Youre twenty minutes late!
One case is not a load.,"So, how are we doing on cotton swabs today? If there's an acute shortage I could run home","Well, I really cant talk about it, but its a very high profile case."
"looks at his leg No, you couldn't.",Nice.,"No, you couldnt."
"Short, sweet. Grab a file.",This ray of sunshine is Dr.,"You cant do that, huh?"
It was yellow.,It was?,Yellow. Go ahead.
It's not any more.,"Hmmm, that's a shame.",Not any more.
"I thought that might be a pRoblem, so I brought you this. She hands him a paint color sample card.",Your mucus was pale goldenrod.,Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
"Last week, yes. Should I be worried?","Oh, yes. Very.","No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes."
Really? I thought I was okay now.,"And yet, here you are. What happened? Paramedics took a week to respond to your 911 call?","I thought I was okay, but it turns out Im not."
"You're not a very nice doctor, are you?",And you are very bad at whatEver it is you do.,"Me? No. No, Im not that kind of doctor."
You don't Even know me!,I know you're going to get fired.,You dont even know me.
I might be quitting.,If you were quitting you would have known that last week when your snot was still pale goldenrod you're getting fired.,"Well if youre asking me to quit, then youre asking me to be someone Im not."
I just don't like being told what to do.,I'll get you in for a full body scan later this week.,Im not accustomed to people saying no to me.
"They're having an effect. His BP's falling fast. Cut to a shot of Brandon coughing. There's fluid filling his lungs. His creatinine's rising. CG shot of the IV meds hitting Brandon's bloodstream. His kidneys are shutting down. Our treatment isn't making him better, it's killing him.","So, we had six symptoms that didn't add up to anything, now we have sEven. Who's excited?",So hows the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?
I don't think it compliCates things. The kidney failure was caused by the antibiotics.,Maybe.,I dont know anything about that.
"I thought that's what we dealt with, here. It explains the cardiomyopathy, pain, the low BP, the fEver.","You read the book. Impressive. It's a ludicrously long shot that explains Every one of those symptoms, except for the cough and the rash. Should we just erase those?","Well, no. We havent been able to cure that one yet. This is last weeks."
"Well, anything can cause a rash.",Okay.,"Uh, rash, thats a bad rash."
"If you're going to list all of the things it can't be, you're gonna need more colors.",Cameron was right. No condition explains all these symptoms. But orange and green covers Everything.,Are you just gonna name all the colours?
Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is always the best.,And you think one is simpler than two.,"Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one."
"Pretty sure it is, yeah.",Baby shows up.,Im pretty sure that it is.
I think your argument is specious.,I think your tie is ugly.,"Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument."
We'll run the tests.,Tests take time. Treatment's quicker. Start the kid on Unasyn for the sinus infection and! what was orange?,I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
What are you doing?,LEvel 4.,Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
"No, I mean",I know what you meant. We're waiting.,"Well, I mean."
My throat hurts.,So you said.,I have an inflamed larynx.
How long are we waiting?,Two minutes less then when you asked me two minutes ago. Cuddy walks in.,How much longer is this gonna take?
Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. Nice to meet you.,"Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult. He closes the Gameboy. His throat seems to have some condition.","Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that Id written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didnt confuse it with what Id written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. Cause if I tried to go there, Id be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello."
He has a sore throat.,"Of course! Yes, why didn't I! I mean, because he said that! it hurt, and I, I should have deduced that meant it was sore!","Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital."
I was in a board meeting.,"Patients come first, right?",Were in a meeting.
"Wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if there was any doubt about its efficacy, huh?","You once asked why I think I'm always right, and I realized that you're right! at least, I think you're right. I don't really know now, do I? Cuddy smiles.","Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and its gonna help me not to snore."
Go home. Drink some hot tea. She leaves.,Excellent counsel.,Let her stay another hour.
"So, a Woman can't express her interest in sex without it being some professional powerplay?",No.,I just dont think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.
Men should grow up.,"Yeah. And dogs should stop licking themselves, it's not gonna happen. Chase comes in.",No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
"Yeah, what are you doing here?",Looking for you guys.,"Look, its my wedding day okay?"
Why didn't you page us?,'Cause I knew you'd be here.,Because tomorrow hes redoing yesterdays pages.
Who told him?,"No one. I assume you're trying to prove my crazy two-illness theory wrong, so, obviously, you're going to be in the lab. You spin the urine? He pops a Vicodin.","Well yknow I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, Whats up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
He pops a Vicodin. Not yet.,Talk to me when you have.,"Oh really, what kind?"
Talk to me when you have.,What did you find out?,Have you? How am I feeling right now?
The kidney failure. It's acute interstitial nephritis.,I wonder if that's signifigant.,Its kidney stones.
It means the antibiotics didn't cause the kidney failure. How did you know?,"Well, if you guys hadn't been so busy trying to prove me wrong, you might have checked in on the poor kid.",So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
You visited a Patient?,"I was sitting by his bed all morning, just so he'd know someone was there for him.","When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?"
I looked in on him. He's much better.,"Ergo, the treatment's working. Ergo, me right, you wrong.",You should. Hes really looked.
That smugness of yours really is an attractive quality.,Thank you. It was either that or get my hair highlighted. Smugness is easier to maintain.,You might be the most arrogant man Ive ever met.
"I get that you're not a big beliEver in the 'catParkng flies with Honey' approach, but do you honestly think you'll collect a jarful by clEverly taunting them?","Flies, no. Doctors, sure. If I'd said to Foreman, Nice try, it was a great guess, but not this time, what do you think he'd be doing right now?","Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?"
I think he'd be going home not feeling like a piece of crap.,Exactly.,He would get his own place.
You want him to feel like a piece of crap?,"No, I don't want him going home.",I know. I want to make him feel bad.
How much longer?,"930, I figure she was on the 8th hole when I paged her!",Um about an hour and half.
"I ran a TSH, T3 and T4. Patient's negative for hypothyroidism. Patient looks up. Not talking about you. She goes back to the Gameboy.",Well the fact that he's getting better would indiCate the unreliability of the tests.,"A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?"
"If I'm right and it's a viral infection, one of two things always happens Patient dies or the Patient's immune system fights off the invader. nods toward Patient What's with her?","Her leg hurts after running six miles. Who knows, it could be anything!",I dont know that Id call myself an infection.
"He's getting better. That doesn't prove you're right, it just proves he's getting better. House smiles. It, it's not two illnesses! It can't be two illnesses!",I am so glad you work here.,"Okay, he is not dying."
"If I'm right, the antibiotics you prescribed could block his kidneys and liver, impeding his ability to fight off the virus. Could kill him.","Well, that certainly would be a concern. Fifty bucks? Patient looks up. Don't look away, the space monkeys will be all over you.","Well, the doctor says hes gonna be fine, hes just sleeping now."
You wanna bet on the Patient's health?,You think that's bad luck?,"So, were all clear on the bet and the stakes?"
Hey. House walks in.,"White cell count isn't up, is it?","Thank you, Hunter."
What if you don't find one? I can't stay here forEver.,The Patient could have died.,"Thats easy for you to say, you found one already."
The one with the pulled muscle.,"Well, those symptoms are consistent with a dozen other conditions. I, you know, I, I'm entitled to a consult!","The One With The Butt, Joey is in a play called Freud!"
You are not getting out of clinic duty.,"Oh, come on.","All right buddy, time to roll over."
"No, I don't, but working with people actually makes you a better doctor.",When did I sign up for that course?,"Um... Im an intern, which makes me a doctor, but..."
When did I give you the impression that I care? pause,Working in this clinic obviously instills a deep sense of compassion.,"Okay, that time you looked at me."
What's with you and her?,Don't.,Whats going on with that woman youre dating?
Do you have a thing for her? The only people who can get to you,No!,Im crazy about her.
Who's the Patient?,I am.,"Hey, Im in a hospital and Im not the patient."
I am. You can't!,Dr. Wilson is the prescribing physician.,I am not!
"Yeah. to House You will lie, cheat and steal to get what you want, but you're incapable of kissing a little ass?","Well, we all have our limitations. He grabs a bottle from the counter and turns to leave.","No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for."
"House! Wrong bottle. He gives House the right bottle. Do me a favor. Take one of these, wait five minutes for it to kick in, and find Cuddy, and kiss her ass. pause","What was the kid's first symptom? small pause You did the history of his 800 symptoms, which one hit him first?",Stanley. Uhh you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
"Ah, the cough.",Gout. He walks back into his office they follow.,No thats just me coughing!
"Gout? Uric acid crystals in the joints? The symptoms are pain, swelling, redness, stiffness! not one of which do I see on that board.",Because he doesn't have gout.,Please give him our regards.
But he doesn't have gout. Why would he have gout medication?,Because you guys were right.,"Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?"
"But once he checked into this hospital he was completely in our control. Our food, our pills, our Everything. So Even if you're right, no gout medication. He'd either continue to deteriorate or he would have gotten better. But he got better, and then he got worse. It doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense.","Okay. Two people screwed up. Not as simple as one, but!","They gave him a lot of medication, ok?"
He's resting he,I'm Dr. House. I'm your son's physician.,He needs to rest.
You're the one he hasn't met. How can you treat someone without meeting them?,It's easy if you don't give a crap about them.,"Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag."
When we checked in Dr. Foreman said,"Tuesday, he's getting better.",Soso what did the doctor say?
His throat was sore.,Page Dr. Occam. He's gonna want to hear about this.,He was reeling from the wine.
"Sorry! He was coughing, and I just wanted to help him",I wish you would dare. Where are the pills?,"Im sorry, I broke down."
It was just cough medicine!,"No, it wasn't. Where's the bottle?","Probably nothing, or strychnine."
"Hey, I'm just a pharmacist, but I know what cough medicine looks like, Doctor.",It was so perfect. It was beautiful.,"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
Beauty often seduces us on the road to truth.,And triteness kicks us in the nads.,"Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
And triteness kicks us in the nads. So true.,This doesn't bother you?,"Its true, but it also keeps a man alive."
That you were wrong? I try to work through the pain,I was not wrong. Everything I said was true. It fit. It was elegant.,And you just assume youre always right?
So! reality was wrong.,"Reality is almost always wrong. takes some Vicodin The cough medicine did something. Aggravated the condition. It's all over the place, must be in his blood.","Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie."
What if it is his blood?,Lymphoma?,"No, theres no blood."
Unless you've got something better.,"Well, we foolishly ruled out lymphoma because his CT scan showed no adenophathy, CBC showed a normal diffen smear, bone marrow showed no",Well isnt it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Screw the tests. Do an exploratory laparotomy and find out what's in there.,"He has no blood pressure, no immune system and no kidneys. Surgery will kill him.","Yes, yes. Yeah, Im definitely going with colonoscopy."
"Yeah, you're right. Let's stick with the wrong pill theory. pause",I'll schedule him for surgery.,"All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill."
"Yeah, but no surgery today.",How you doing?,Im having surgery!
How you doing? Okay.,Great.,"So, how you doing?"
I should go.,You think it's going to come out on its own?,"The blond woman is my exwife, and the woman touching her is her."
How did you,"You've been here half an hour and haven't sat down, that tells me its location.","Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesnt call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?"
It's an MP3 player.,"has to digest this for a moment Is it! is it because of the size, or the shape, or the pounding bass line?","Yeah, exactly. Its an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox."
What are we going to do?,looks at his watch I'm gonna wait.,"So, what are we gonna do?"
looks at his watch I'm gonna wait. For what?,"Okay, it's 300, I'm off.",For the Watch.
Brandon's not ready for surgery.,"Okay, well, let's leave it a couple of weeks. He should be feeling better by then. Oh wait, which way does time go?","Sheldon, Im sorry I didnt tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing."
He crashed during prep. He's also experiencing pain in his fingers. I think some bug may have gotten in the clean room. I think we should double his dosage of GCSF to temporarily boost his blood cell count.,Pain in his fingers! right. pops a Vicodin,"Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital."
Pain in his fingers! right. pops a Vicodin,to Mrs. Merrell Hi again. He enters the prep area.,"Oh my God, hes really in pain."
"Where's he going? House walks in without all of the prep Robes, air, etc.","Hey! How y'all doing? Interesting fact Every sEven years it's a whole new you. Inspiring metaphor, huh?",Im pretty sure his familys coming with him.
"Dr. House, this is a clean room.","Yeah, I read the sign.",The clean room.
But we went to the pharmacy. We saw the pills!,ColParkcine does its damage in a very specific order.,"Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?"
"Then, the kidneys go, which is exactly what happened to!. Brandon.",Right.,Your last roommates kidney?
"No, he's not!",Ecstasy?,No hes not!
"Twice, with Dan and Mike.",D'you know what they cut that stuff with?,"One time. You love bringing up that one time, dont you?"
Start!. Brandon.,Lovely name.,"Come with me, Brandon Stark!"
"I think you'll remember. You know, it wouldn't hurt you to be wrong now and then.","What, you don't care about these people?","Someday youre going to be wrong, and I hope Im there to see it."
"Merrell hugs her husband, and then hugs Mindy. Big weekend?","It's not for me, I'm fully stocked.",I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mikes parents.
Cuddy got you doing inventory?,Nope. Trying to solve that kid's case.,"Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?"
The gout medicine OD?,Yeah.,An antacid that you only take once a week.
The fact that I know that it's a gout medicine OD would seem to indiCate that the case is already solved.,"Well, you'd be wrong.",This is a pill that I found here in the office.
"What about the fact that the kid is now, I beliEve the technical term is, not sick?",You know how Many forms of colParkcine there are on the market?,Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
You know how Many forms of colParkcine there are on the market? Stop it.,"Neither do I, but it's a lot. Pills, powders, liquids, IV fluids!. Somewhere at a party, in his coffee, up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some.","Anyway, it was Bernies idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation."
"So, you're not happy with your Ecstasy theory?",He said he used it twice.,"Thats the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!"
He said he used it twice. People lie.,"Yeah, but if you're gonna lie, it's",How did he use it again?
"You know what, I'm not interested.",Not curious?,Im not interested.
"No, because I'm well-adjusted. He walks off.",Right.,"No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut."
It's what we expected. The accident caused serious damage.,It's amnesia.,That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm.
"Enjoying our lounge, House?","I just came in to get milk for my coffee, which you're out of.","What, what are you doing in our apartment?"
Flat or sParkling?,Flat.,This is flatter.
Pediatrician'll take all the credit.,to Wilson Exhibit A Baby girl Hartig.,How was the pediatrician?
I'm still amazed you're in the same room with a Patient.,People don't bug me until they get teeth.,"Okay, you have to understand something, were in a hospital right now."
"Wow, that is amazing. You hung out in the OB/GYN lounge and heard about two sick babies. It's eerie. goes to touch something, I'm presuming a baby",Don't touch that.,Hey! Yknow that teacher who had a baby with her student?
confused All right!,We have an infection spreading in the hospital.,"Okay, Im a little confused here."
unbelieving These kids have totally unrelated illnesses.,"They fell sick within four hours of each other. They had the same delivery rooms, maternity rooms are neighboring, so transmission's possible. They have the same symptoms.",Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
"The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction. No matter how close their beds are, I'm pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.",What does bowel obstruction on a chart indiCate?,"No, not if their room has two beds!"
"Well, normally, I'd say it indiCates a Patient's bowel is obstructed, but I'm pretty sure you have some deeper truth to impart",It means that some random doctor of indeterminate skill thinks that the Patient's bowel is obstructed.,Hes referring to an activity he has done before.
"trying not to laugh Okay, you're upset because they threw you out of their lounge.",Look at the x-ray. It's a normal gas pattern.,I cant believe they kicked you out.
"You want, I can get you a key to the oncology lounge.",simultaneously Air. Air in the colon.,Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
We're getting TiVo.,"If it's air, no bowel obstruction.","Well Umm, I got TiVo."
"Even if it is air, it could have been there before the obstruction.",No. Something's infected both these infants.,"No, we dont know that."
And you're the only one who put this together because!?,Because I'm the only one who looked at both kids. I want them isolated I want the maternity ward shut down.,I know that you worked hard to put this together.
Because you're better at reading an x-ray than a radiologist.,"Radiologists always over-read babies' x-rays, especially if they're asked to rule out a pathology. He read into it what he wanted.",So? Doctors like me. Whenever I see mine he calls in a bunch of other doctors to have a look.
Which is exactly what you're doing. You're finding a cluster because you think it's interesting to find a cluster. Two! plain old sick babies would bore you.,"See, this is why I don't waste money on shrinks, 'cause you give me all these really great insights for free.","Ok, Im sorry, Im just not very good with babies."
"smiling Shrink. If you would consider going to a shrink, I would pay for it myself. The hospital would hold a bake sale, for God's sake.",We have an epidemic! Cuddy stops from going out the door and turns to House.,Im not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist.
"slowly Two sick babies is very sad, but it doesn't prove an epidemic. She leaves. House is left alone in her office.",How Many do?,"Wait, so how does the story end?"
How Many do?,Get up! We're going hunting.,Someone does. Me.
We're going hunting. For what?,Wabbits.,Do you wanna go hunting?
For what? Wabbits.,"Hi. pause Bye. passes the baby to Foreman, saying quietly He's screaming, he's fine.",The next year he really stepped things up.
"Good news, no epidemic. Tragic, huh?","looks at elevator Overflow rooms, third floor. goes into elevator",Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
We were just going to call.,Did he get hot all of a sudden?,Hey. I was just about to call you.
"You'll be there very, very soon. elevator door closes, next line to House Happy now?",No. But I am interested.,Youre waiting for the elevator?
No. But I am interested.,"Three sick babies, and a fourth showing early symptoms.",No. But thank you for asking.
"Well, there's gotta be something in common.",Yeah. That would be the difference between an epidemic and a coincidence.,"Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think."
A needle in a haystack.,It's worse than that. We don't Even know what's the needle we're looking for. He starts to erase the whiteboard.,"Its the eye of the tiger, its the ear of the bat, its the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus."
Then why'd you let her go do it?,"Because the hospital's her baby, and her baby's sick.",Then why did she even go out with you?
Spreading too quickly. House writes parasite on the board and crosses it off.,Next?,"What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine."
"And they're not responding to a cycle of avirarapovirin. If it's some other virus, we'll nEver find it in time, anyway. House writes a question mark next to virus.","Which leads us to bacterial infection. which he writes on the board It's not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, so we've got something resistant. The usual suspects.",Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.
H-Flu. House writes these all down.,"Okay, those are the big ones.",Wait. What are you writing? Dont write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? Cause Im suffering from both.
We have an epidemic in this hospital and your tie is becoming a Petri dish. Put on a tie clip or take the damn thing off.,Lift up your arms. She does so. You have a parasite.,"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but."
Like a tapeworm or something?,"Lie back and lift up your sweater. She lies back, and still has her hands up. You can put your arms down.",Only if youre this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
Can you do anything about it?,"Only for about a month or so. After that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple of states. He starts to ultrasound her abdomen.","Well, but Im not sure I really want to do anything about it."
He starts to ultrasound her abdomen. Illegal?,"Don't worry. Many women learn to embrace this parasite. They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites",Its not ok to do it in a doctors office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
"They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites Playdates!",shows her the ultrasound It has your eyes. It's a baby!,"For starters, they shed and bite."
But! that's impossible.,"Well, I assume you weren't getting your period. Maybe that should have give you an inkling.","No. No, Toby. Hes not. Yes he is. Hes my nephew."
But I'm on this birth control implant!,"Yeah, I know. I saw the scar on your arm.","Slick, that implant isnt who you are, okay?"
!and my doctor said I might not get any periods at all if it was working.,Mm hmm.,It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives.
"Um, Doctor? Please. Me and my husband wanted to have a kid soon, but! oh, God. Like four months ago we had this really big fight. House looks like he knows where this is going He moved out. I did something stupid.",One-night stand?,What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!!
One-night stand? Ex-boyfriend.,"I'll schedule you a paternity test, too.","Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"
I can't let my husband know.,Does the old boyfriend look like your husband?,Disgusting. Do not tell him.
thinks a little Yeah!,Then just have the kid.,"Yeah! A little bit, yeah..."
"Then just have the kid. He'll nEver know. The most successful marriages are based on lies. You're off to a great start. He leaves, Jill looks like she's going to cry.","Well, you look cheery. What's going on?",So whoawhoawhoawhoa! What are you gonna do? Youre gonna have the baby andand raise it by yourselfwithout a husband?! You cant be a single mother alone! Youre gonna ruin your life!
And the urine tests show no casts.,Which means the antibiotics are causing the kidney failure.,Come on! Youre just titling! Her legs are fine!
I still think it's the pseudomonas. I vote to take them off the Vancomycin. long pause,There's no point in guessing. Take one kid off Vancomycin and the other off Aztreonam.,Maybe its a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
What the hell are you doing?,Theraputic trial to find the cause of the infection.,The hell you doing?
Theraputic trial to find the cause of the infection. That's wrong.,"We have four sick kids, at least. Who knows how Many more haven't started showing symptoms yet?","Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hotdog fingers. Governmentcreated killer nanorobot infection."
We have a duty to these two!,If these two have different reactions we know how to save the rest.,"Oh, no! Weve got to do something."
So you're condemning one of these kids to die based on random chance. pregnant pause,I guess I am.,Youre speaking of murdering a child.
"So, you're going to flip a coin? That's how you decide which baby lives?",Can I borrow a quarter?,"Oh, were gonna flip for the baby?"
"Do you want to get sued, lose your license, House? Well, generally I'd applaud that, but my job is to protect this hospital, so I strongly advice you to come up with a medical rationale why Baby A should get Medicine X and vice-versa.","Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there, Slick.","All right, lets say a physician was prescribing one of our competitors drugs."
Any medical justification. Doesn't need to be a good one.,"Well, Hartig sounds Jewish, so does Aztreonam, so we'll take the Hartig kid off Vancomycin, how's that? pause","When it comes down to it, its a health issue."
You can't experiment on babies.,Doctors experiment all the time.,"Okay, but this cant be good for the baby."
On adults. With their consent.,Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.,On an innocent baby.
Their informed consent. They have to know the other kid is getting a different treatment.,"Sorry, can't do that. It'd be unethical for one Patient to know about another Patient's treatment.",Does he have access to their medical records?
They have a right to know.,"If they know, they won't consent that defeats the whole purpose.","Well, they dont have to know that."
That's their right.,getting up from the couch Two more babies have just become symptomatic. I defer to your legal wisdom which takes precedence? Six dying babies or a missing consent form?,"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnt for fun."
"Dr. House! Dr. House, this is my husband, Charlie.",Who told you where my office was?,Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
"Jill, come on, he obviously doesn't want us bothering him.","Ooh, I was trying to hide it.","Oh my God, Jill!"
"Look, Doctor, this is about the mono you said you thought I had!",The mono?,Maybe youve got mono.
"Yes. You know, shouldn't Charlie be tested? You know, House looks at Jill like she's insane the test. The blood test.","catches on Right. Yeah, I'm sorry, I sometimes forget Patients, I thought you were this idiot who doesn't know how to use birth control. pointed look","No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night."
I can't have mono. I don't Even feel sick or anything.,"That's very often the first sign. He gets into the elevator. Call my office in the morning, I'll schedule him for bloodtests. The elevator doors close.",Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Charging. Clear. shock Charging.,Chase. pause Time of death 657 PM. long pause The Aztreonam doesn't work. Double-cover all the other babies with Vancomycin.,Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.
I'll do it.,"Cameron, you tell the parents. Tell them their Parkld pRobably saved five lives.","Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way."
But Chase should,Chase is busy.,"No, he shouldnt."
You're the attending.,to Wilson Make sure she does her job.,You said we were invited.
to Wilson Make sure she does her job.,"I asked you to make sure she does her job, not do it for her.",I think shes doing a good job.
She froze up.,She felt sorry for the parents so she shut up. You felt sorry for her so you opened your mouth.,"Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!"
She has a pRoblem.,"Yeah, she needs to deal with it. If you hadn't bailed her out, she would have done it.","Ok, I dont care what you guys say, somethings bothering her."
"Great, then she wouldn't have slept for two weeks. Maybe she should be thinking about a different specialty. Lab work, research? Chase walks up.","Yeah, what is it?","No! No, come on let her sleep! Shes so exhausted."
"The Hartig baby. She's getting sicker, too. The Vancomycin isn't working, either.",Vancomycin doesn't kill it. Aztreonam doesn't kill it. What the hell is this?,"Ya know, shes having another baby."
Then these kids are dead.,This is our fault.,Then they will be at The Mothers mercy.
Even with three pressers? Heart damage?,Go home. There's nothing more you can do tonight.,"No, that wouldnt kill her."
Go home. There's nothing more you can do tonight.,"Baby boy Chen-Lupino. Time of death 657 PM Thursday, December 2nd, 2004. He takes the covers off of the tools and starts to remove the baby's diaper.",Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
"Baby boy Chen-Lupino. Time of death 657 PM Thursday, December 2nd, 2004. He takes the covers off of the tools and starts to remove the baby's diaper.","This is a cross-section of the Chen-Lupino boy's myocardium. Fibrosis, lymphocydic infiltrates.","Even if the boy lives, hell be a cripple, a grotesque."
There was no sign of lymphcytosis in the blood tests.,"Yes, well, we all had plenty of good reasons to think bacterial.",We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
A thousand of them? The kids don't have enough blood.,"Chase, you're the intensivist. How Many could we do before we risk exsanguinating the kids?","Oh God, now theres three of them, were outnumbered!"
"You're talking vials, not stick tests? I wouldn't take more than five or six.","writes Virus on the white board' Okay, so we have to narrow the thousand viruses down to six.","Its digital, so just take as many as you want."
Cross out the herpes viruses.,"Also adenovirus. House starts to make a T-chart on the board. What else, what else? Keep talking.",Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes.
You didn't find any lung damage?,No.,Did you bring enough inhalers?
None of the parAmyxoviridae.,"Cardiac scarring, people.","All right, how about the ladybugs?"
"Enteroviruses, too, I think.",muttering Echo 11.,"Oh, yes, the common cold."
muttering Echo 11. Influenza A.,mutters Influ A. Yes. And? We see more ideas being written on the board. I'm putting RSV down as a yes. That makes eight.,"Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago."
Eight vials of blood is pushing it.,"Pushing it, but we love that! Get the antibody kits, start testing the sick kids.",We can drink some blood while we wait.
"All right, I'll start looking into whether there are any antivirals for these eight.","Wait a second. The, the kids on the floor who didn't get sick. Are any of them still in the hospital?",Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. Well do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didnt you?
"No, the Lindpert boy had a bit of jaundice. He should be checking out today.","I want to test his blood, too.",Is that true?
"I want to test his blood, too. Why?",'Cause we need all the information we can get. The healthy kid can be our control group.,Just go to his house and see if hes sick.
"All done, all done.",What did we get?,Its all done!
"Well, the sick babies all tested positive for Echovirus 11.",Great.,Weve got to find a new pediatrician.
"And CMV, and parvovirus B19.",Three viruses?,"Wait, canine AIDS?"
"What's weirder, the healthy kid we tested he's positive for Echovirus 11 and CMV antibodies as well.","sighs They're infants. They have their mother's blood, their mother's antibodies.","Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know?"
So we just learned nothing?,Uh-uh. We have half the picture. The healthy kids survived because their mothers' antibodies saved them.,"Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you cant teach an old dog new tricks, because its illegal, and you will go to jail."
"The mom had CMV in the past she'd have the antibodies for them, the kid would be immune from it. So we test the sick kids' moms for Echovirus, CMV, and parvovirus.","And whichEver they don't have the antibodies for, that's what's killing their kids.",Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
"Sure. They enter the room, now in scrubs, and hold Maxine.","Hey, Foreman? Got a minute? Foreman gets into the elevator.",I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
"So, pulmonary resistance is stabilized for the two kids, but BP's still","No news, then. How's Cameron?","Your vitals are stable, but lets take you in for some tests just to be safe."
How's Cameron? Dr. Cameron?,"Sure. Let's start with her, and move on to all the other Camerons we know.","Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?"
"Sorry, I'm just not used to you asking about someone's well-being.",I can understand how the question would surprise you. I don't quite get how it would confuse you.,"Nellie, Im sorry, but I dont feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I dont know."
Why do you want to know? They get out of the elevator.,Why do you want to know why I want to know?,The stairwell. They ascend without talking.
Why do you want to know why I want to know? Just curious.,"Me, too.",But you just said you wanted to know.
You don't get curious.,I'm the most curious Man in the world.,"Wow, so youre not curious at all?"
Not about trivialities.,"Well, then, this must not be trivial. How is Cameron handling Everything? They're at the doors of the clinic.","Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial."
They're at the doors of the clinic. Just fine.,"Great, glad we talked.",Where are the healers?
"Great, glad we talked.",Your husband is definitely the source of your mono.,"Okay, nice talking to you."
"Oh, wow. Oh, thank God. Wow, I'm going to be a mom. Whoa, heh heh. Thank you so much I gotta get you a gift or something.",Sometimes the best gift is the gift of nEver seeing you again.,"Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?"
"Okay, all right! But, Dr. House, you've been so awesome. I mean, I really, totally trust you. Do you think you",No.,"No, no, wait."
-- could do the prenatal?,No.,"Well, not right now."
Or deliver the baby?,That would be no.,And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth.
"No, it's great. Ethan and Karen start to laugh and cry.",They all gone?,"No, its really good."
Hartigs are checking out right now.,You look tired.,"They have been checking us out, all night!"
You look tired. Thanks.,It's no wonder. You've had a hard time the last couple of days.,Well you seem a little tired.
And you haven't?,Not like you.,"Oh, have you not?"
She leaves. Unfinished business?,I'm in the haystack.,I dont know.
"Ah, because now you know you're looking for a needle.",Right.,You have your Needle?
"If I tell you to let it go, it won't make any difference, will it?","Enteroviruses are spread by huMans. Fecal, oral! could be respiratory secretions, though.","Oh, will you please let it go?"
"So, Cuddy got stool samples from the whole staff. Just wait until they come back.",That won't do it.,How do we know this?
That won't do it. Why not?,"The shedder, whoEver he is, is so virulent, Cuddy must have noticed him.","Okay, yeah, so its not gonna work."
"The shedder, whoEver he is, is so virulent, Cuddy must have noticed him. Hmmm.",And the babies didn't share any common personnel. That's what's weird.,"Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin at him."
"Hey, seriously, Man, you're not supposed to be here.",I'm performing a delivery.,You shouldnt be here.
I'm performing a delivery. You are.,"Patient whose prenatal care I've been handling. Just checking her out a couple of minutes ago. Of course, I'll need one of you two guys to supervise.",Oh my. Were gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
When's she due?,Late March.,Oh mama! Uh whenwhen is the baby due?
That's five months from now.,Thank God these chairs are comfortable.,What about five years from now?
Thank God these chairs are comfortable.,We are condemned to useless labor. House has a giant stack of charts next to him.,Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
Fourth circle of Hell. Charting goes a lot faster when you eliminate the whole of classic poetry. House flicks a candy at him.,Writing down what we already know to be read by nobody. Pretty sure Dante would agree that qualifies as useless.,I feel like Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
You're over two weeks behind on your charting. House flicks another candy it almost goes down Cuddy's shirt.,Oops. I missed.,Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
"What are you, eight?",Could an eight-year-old do this? He makes a face. Wilson smiles.,You understand I dont actually like 8yearold boys.
You better stop or it'll stick that way. You have a Patient in Exam Room 1.,"Yeah, but see, see, I'm off at twelve and it's already five of.","Relax Mr. Smith, youre in an alien hospital. I mean to you its an alien hospital, to me youre just in a hospital. Theres another matter we need to discuss with you."
She's been waiting for you since elEven. Cuddy walks off.,Melancholy without hope. Which circle is that?,"Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?"
Melancholy without hope. Which circle is that?,Hi. I'm Dr. House. What seems to be the pRoblem?,"Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow."
"stigmata. Shhhh, Pius!",You must be all the talk around the holy water cooler. You been washing a lot of dishes recently?,"Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3D last supper, Judas is a little loose."
I help out in the kitchen.,Anything new in the kitchen?,Do you need any help in the kitchen?
I unpacked and washed them.,"Should have spent your time saving souls, it's easier on the hands. This is contact dermatitis you're allergic to dish soap.",What do we do with them after we wash them?
Nonsense! We've always used that soap. Why is there a pRoblem now?,I've been a doctor for years.,Because soap is soap.
"Thank you, Doctor.",You want some water? He hands her the pills.,"Hey, doc? You forgetting something? Thank you."
I have some tea.,"Well, you just relax for a few minutes.",You want some tea?
Still out by twelve.,How do you solve a pRoblem like dermatitis?,Theres still an hour.
She talking to you?,I don't know. She's certainly looking at me.,Was she talkin back?
"Oh, it's good to get a secular diagnosis. The sisters tend to interpret their diagnosis as divine intervention.",And you don't? Then you're wearing an awfully funny hat.,"Damnit, Im a doctor, Im not God."
"Doctor, something's wrong!",Lift up your Parkn.,"Well, youre the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound."
"He sticks the needle in her arm, CGI shot of the bloodstream going to her lungs, and the airways opening. What happened?",Did she take the pill?,A doctors surgery.
Did she take the pill? Yes.,It's pRobably an allergic reaction.,No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
She's allergic to an anti-allergy medicine?,You figure somebody's out to get her? How're you feeling?,"Tell her, Im allergic, and I will sue!"
How're you feeling? Better.,I'll put you on some steroids instead.,"How ya feeling, better?"
Is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny?,"It's called adrenaline, it makes your heart beat fast. He feels her pulse. But not this fast. to the others Get a nurse, please. Lie back.","Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly arent."
Help! Somebody help us! House opens Augustine's shirt and listens to her heartbeat.,"Somebody get in here! A tech comes in. Call a code and charge up a defibrillator. She's got no pulse. The tech runs out, House starts chest compressions.","Uh.. forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks"
"You diagnosed the Patient with allergies and prescribed antihistamine, she went into respiratory distress, and you injected her with epinephrine. Presumably 1 cc.","0.1 cc. That is the standard dose, that is what I gave her.","Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?"
People don't go into cardiac arrest from 0.1 cc epinephrine.,She must have a pre-existing heart condition that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.,Close. Its gonna make your kidneys shut down.
It's too bad you didn't make a notation in the chart.,I can make it up right now.,Good. Im taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
"The drawer has syringes with both dosages, you could have easily reached for the wrong one.",But I didn't.,Do not adjust the dosage.
Everyone makes mistakes. This is why doctors pay through the nose for malpractice insurance.,"Relax, they're not going to sue. Worse they'd do is whack my hand with a ruler.","When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?"
"And the discipline board? Are they gonna whack your hand, too?",You're going to report me?,Maybe slapped with a fine.
What choice do I have?,"Uh, how 'bout not report me?",Do I have a choice?
"The eosinophils were mildly elevated, sed rate's up a bit. Could be looking at a systemic allergic response.",It's not allergic. Allergies don't cause cardiac arrest like this. Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.,I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication Im on.
Vasculitis? That wouldn't give you an elevated eosinophil count.,"Churg-Strauss vasculitis would. Blood vessels of the heart, lungs and skin become inflamed causing the asthma, rash and heart pRoblems. Covers all her symptoms. They reach the diagnostic office.",When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind.
The lady just came in with a rash. House stops and stares at a bunch of candy canes on the table.,What the hell are those?,The basket is totally empty!
Candy canes. Foreman takes one.,Candy canes? Are you mocking me?,Some little snacks for everybody.
"No! It's Christmas and, and I, I, I thought",Relax. It's a joke.,I dont know.
"Yeah. Untreated only 33% of Patients survive past a year treated, five years.",Then I'd definitely suggest treatment.,There you are.
"If it was any other attending doctor, I'd say that he made a mistake and gave her too much epinephrine.",pouring coffee Saying you wouldn't say it was my mistake is saying it was my mistake.,The nurse said theyre bringing in another woman.
Everyone screws up your rule. I think you fit inside the subset of Everyone.,"I didn't screw up. Foreman shakes his head. Order a chest CT and start the sister on prednisone, 40 mg. TID.","Hey, hey, hey, thats not the rule and you know it."
TID. The sister?,"Oh, didn't I mention? The Patient's a nun. Sister Augustine.",I cant remember which sister.
Aw. I hate nuns.,thinks a little Who doesn't?,"What are you, a nun?"
There is that.,If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake the least she could do is suspend me from clinic duty.,BOBODDY! BOBODDY. What does the first B stand for?
She doesn't confuse making a mistake with being incompetent.,"Oh, here we go. Lesson time. I recognize that confidence is not my short suit. I also recognize that I am huMan and capable of error.","Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Years Eve 1997."
So you might have screwed this up?,No.,Perhaps Ive made a terrible mistake.
"So, it's only a theoretical capacity for error.",Good point. Maybe there isn't one. Maybe that's my error.,Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
"You know, most people who think as much of themselves as you do like to talk about themselves.","Most people don't like to listen, so what's wrong with you? He leaves Wilson standing in the clinic.","Thats true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?"
"Most people don't like to listen, so what's wrong with you? He leaves Wilson standing in the clinic.",Let me guess! inflammatory bowel.,"Well that works out good, because Im not listening."
"Wow, yeah. Is it that bad?","Yes. It's also written on your chart. Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain! took sulfasalazine, but it didn't work","Oh my God, is it really that bad?"
"No, then I","Next tried steroid enemas, oral corticosteroids, 5ASAs, 6 mercaptopurine! I'm impressed.",No? Then you are an idiot.
By my medical history?,By how well your last doctor charted.,"Youre healthy. You have a job in the sciences. Ive got to say, if this credit report comes back good, youre the frontrunner."
"It's one thing to have to go to the bathroom Every hour, but when the kids sit on my lap, it's!. The store sent me home, they're gonna fire me. Can't you put me back on 5ASA? Maybe it'll work this time?",Not likely.,"Uhhuh! Nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!"
tries to read House's writing Cojorius?,Cigarettes.,"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses."
Are you kidding me?,"About the looking cooler, yeah. The rest is true.","Yes. Im sorry, master. Forgive me. I didnt think"
Isn't it addictive and dangerous?,Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe are addictive and dangerous. The difference with this one is that it's completely legal. He turns to leave. Merry Christmas.,"No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure."
Patient tested positive for herpetic encephalitis.,So what's that tell us?,I know tons and tons of people who have herpes.
"Ooh, I know! Prednisone compromises the immune system. Isn't that the medicine you gave her for the thing she doesn't have?","Yeah, but! hey. I'm think that's a trick question.","Okay, but shed feel better if she took her medicine."
Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?,In ten seconds I'm gonna announce that I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.,Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me.
You're gonna admit negligence?,Unless you leave the room.,Okay. Just make it look like an accident.
"Sure, she was feeling better right up to the moment it almost killed her.","On the other hand, it explains the symptoms. Swollen hands, pulmonary pRoblems, cardiac pRoblems it all fits.",Really? And that didnt make her feel better?
Except her ANA was normal.,So redraw the blood.,"Well, normals a strong word, but sure."
"But the treatment is corticosteroids, prednisone, and we can't go there because of the encephalitis.",Then we'll treat it with something that modulates the immune system but doesn't suppress it. Hyperbaric oxygen chAmber.,"Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain."
There's no protocol for putting a Patient in a high-pressure oxygen room to treat autoimmune pRoblems.,"Oh, you people.",Do Not Resuscitate
"You are aware of the Hippocratic Oath, right?","The one that starts First, do no harm, then goes on to tell us no abortions, no seductions, and definitely no cutting of those who labor beneath the stone.","Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest."
"Hyperbaric treatments could cause oxygen toxicity, lung and eye damage",Every treatment has its dangers,"No, of course not."
Which is why we treat when we're only convinced the Patient needs the treatment.,"I'm convinced. You're not. Question is, what are you going to do about it? Hmm?",And thats exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.
This is a chapel. A House of prayer.,"House of prayer, huh. That explains the good reception. Also why nobody's Ever here.",Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in Kings Landing?
"I need to talk with you, Dr. House. Sister Augustine beliEves in things that aren't real.",I thought that was a job requirement for you people.,"Ha. The opposite. Shes a neurobiologist, and Im a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg."
She's been known to lie to get sympathy. She's a hypochondriac.,"turns off TV So, you're warning me that I may be treating a non-existent ailment","Well, why would she lie to you?"
"Sore throats, joint pains! there's always something wrong, and there's nEver a reason for it. Mother Superior plays right into it. Lets Augustine off work duties, treating her as fragile, special.",That must make you angry. eats a piece of chocolate,"Shes sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And shes given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King."
It bothers me. It's not really in Augustine's best interests. She keeps looking at the chocolate bar.,offers the chocolate Want some?,"Fine, it bothers me a little."
I shouldn't. takes the bar and sits down next to House,"I guess you've got to be good at reading people to be a good infirmarian, huh.","Ok, so promise that youll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar."
around a mouthful of chocolate Mm hmm.,"So, we've got pride, anger, envy, gluttony!. That's four out of sEven deadly sins in two minutes. Do you people keep records of these things? Is there a Cathlympics?","Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do."
They say you have a gift.,They like to talk.,Its like a gift.
You hide behind your intelligence.,"Yeah, that's pretty stupid.",Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
"And you make jokes because you're afraid to take anything seriously. Because if you take things seriously, they matter, and if they matter","And when things go wrong, I get hurt. I'm not tough, I'm vulnerable.",Thats because most jokes are lies and youre devoted to the truth.
"I barely know you, and I don't know if I'm right. I just hope I am. Because the alternative is, you really are as miserable as you seem to be. pause","You know, from the way you're looking at me right now, I'd say you just hit number five lust.","OK, youre whiney, you are, youre obsessive, you are insecure, youre, youre gutless, you know, you dont ever, you dont just sort of seize the day, you know."
Mixed connective tissue disease? Her ANA is barely elevated!,"Well, thanks for checking up on her. Good to know you've got my back.",Well the vet seems to think thats shes becoming a rooster.
"0-2 stat is down to 83, pulmonary pRoblems, breathing pRoblems",Irritation from the oxygen is typical.,Whats happening to him and what that means.
She comes in with a rash and you put her into cardiac arrest.,"That well just nEver runs dry, does it? If there was no underlying pRoblem, then why is she still having the rapid heartrate?",Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her?
Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis caused by you giving her prednisone!,"Her reaction is a symptom, not an error.","Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in."
"There's always an explanation, isn't there?","Yes, there is! And if this one doesn't work will find another.","Well, theres got to be an explanation."
But nEver one involving you screwing up.,One that fits all the facts.,"What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappalis dog, or almost drove off with that baby?"
"Can't get enough of this place, huh?",Came for my stethoscope.,Yeah. This place is great.
"So, I shouldn't read too much into the fact that you were looking for it in the drawer with the epinephrine syringes in it?","Okay, yeah. I'd like to clear my reputation.","Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation."
"Oh, right. I forgot that you care about what people think. Prescribing cigarettes for inflammatory bowel? It could cause lung cancer, you know.","leaving the exam room You know why they have ribbons for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and not for lung cancer?","Hey, yknow, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease."
They ran out of colors?,It's because people blame lung cancer Patients.,Has it always been purple?
"Huh. Well, guilt does a lot of damage.",You said that with great significance.,"Well, Ill tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasnt me."
You're not here to find your stethoscope. You're not here to clear your reputation. You're here because you're having doubts. You might have screwed up.,"I'm here because, if I'm right, Cuddy is killing that Patient.","Oh, this is very embarrassing."
"Okay, but if you're wrong? pause",Then she's saving her.,"Well, yeah, but yknow, whatwhat if I was wrong?"
My mother's been dead for 10 years.,But she's always with you in spirit. What do you know about the nun?,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
What do you know about the nun? Which one?,"The cute one. I think she likes me. The sick one, obviously.",So what do we know about her?
Her parents died when she was a Parkld and she's been with the Church Ever since.,What's she lying about?,Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
Why do you say that?,"I always say that. And the old nun says the sick nun is a big fat nun liar. You know nuns, what do you think?",You should point out the hypocrisy of that.
I don't know nuns.,You hate nuns. You can't hate someone if you don't know them.,"What? I have seven Catholic sisters. Ive taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, dont we?"
Know any Nazis? Maybe I hate them on principle.,I have a theory on what makes good boys good.,"Dont! Dont! Dont talk about Nazis in front of you know what? Theyre going to have nightmares, so why dont you just shut it?"
"I think if she did have a secret, her boss would know. He leaves.","Did you paint, or put in new carpets recently?","See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant!"
"Did you paint, or put in new carpets recently? No.",Any way she could have got access to drugs?,I just had the carpets steamed.
"Well, we lock all of our medications in the infirmary, and we don't keep prescription drugs here. Nun is making tea. Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine about these things directly?",I've found that when you want to know the truth about someone that someone is pRobably the last person you should ask.,"Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom?"
Ah. And have you been speaking to Sister Eucharist?,She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly. If I were you I'd have her repeat a year of nun school. Nun chuckles.,"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegors holdfast."
Becoming a nun doesn't make you a saint.,Becoming a doctor doesn't make you a healer.,"Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa."
Just because we live in a monastery and we spend most of our time in prayer doesn't mean we don't find time for drama.,"So, what is the sick one's drama?",The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Sister Augustine lived in Catholic foster care until she came to us. kettle whistles Tea?,Sure.,You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?
We consider that our life begins when we put on our habits and take our vows. What happens before then,"Is irrelevant to you, but it's relevant to me.",When will the wedding take place in your mind?
"Sister Augustine went into foster care when she was six years old, but she left when she was twelve. She lived on the streets, she got into drugs. When she was fifteen, she became pregnant, tried to self-abort. She lost the Parkld, she became ill. We took her in when she came back. If we had thought it was medically relevant we would have told you.","It's not. He takes a sip of tea, then looks at it. This tea is delicious. Local herbs?","Oh. Well, her loss. Ive been called a genuine medical oddity."
"Of course he might be right! It might be the Hand of God at work. Don't say it's something else unless you've got something concrete to offer. A teabag is thrown onto Cuddy's paperwork, she picks it up and stares at the entering House. What's this, hemlock?",I'm going to do you the biggest favor one doctor can do another.,"Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?"
"Still, what the hell, it tastes great. Sister Augustine","Has been drinking it religiously, so to speak.","Okay, now what was that all about?"
Take the cardiac arrest out of the equation!,All the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a sEvere long-term allergic reaction.,His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
That's what Cameron said in the beginning.,"Yes, she did.",Thats what Michael said.
"Damned if you do, damned if you don't.","Because it's been untreated for so long, it's gone from a simple watery eyes, scratchy throat allergy to a whopping I'm-gonna-kick-your-ass allergy, compromising her immune system, diminishing her ability to heal and breaking down her organs systems.","Just like Schrodingers Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad."
The dish soap.,"No, symptoms persisted days after the dishwashing episode. It's gotta be something she's been exposed to here in the hospital as well as the monastery.","Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, were going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."
"Well, what about the tea? It caused her arrhythmia.","Could be, but it's not definitive.",What?! She made the tea!
Get her in a clean room.,Okay. And we'll gradually introduce allergens and see how she responds. When she reacts to something we'll know that's what killing her.,"Look, I mean, Im not proud of it, but it does work."
It's a clean room!,How do you get an allergic reaction in a clean room?,Yeah. Its cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
Maybe it was the preservatives in the IV?,Checked that.,Because you knew it was poisoned.
Checked that. Latex tubing?,Checked that. Checked Everything.,"While we finish soldering these boards, itd be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape."
"Well, it could be mast-cell leukemia. It can cause anaphylaxis.",Checked the blood lEvels. And it's not eosinophilia or idiopathic anaphylasix.,"Hello, there. Im Dr. Carlin. I see someones having an allergic reaction."
Maybe it's just divine will.,It's not my will. takes a couple of Vicodin,God works in mysterious ways.
"You do realize if you're wrong, about the big picture that is, you're going to burn, right?","What do you want me to do? Accept it, pack it in?",Why do you have the Big picture up again?
Yeah. I want you to accept that sometimes Patients die against all reason. Sometimes they get better against all reason.,"No, they don't. We just don't know the reason.",No rest for the sick.
I just wanted to say that I know that you did Everything you could.,"I don't need verification from you to know that I'm doing my job well. That's your pRoblem, not mine.",I just wanna thank you for being there for me today.
I was just being nice.,"Yeah, well, you don't need to always do that. pause",I guess I could be nicer.
Sister Augustine's been extubated.,Good.,Your sister sought the gods mercy and atoned for her sin.
She's requested to check out against medical advice. She wants to go back to the monastery.,"Well, talk her out of it.",Her accommodations seem sufficient.
I think I may have talked her into it.,Room's paid up for the rest of the week. You might as well stick around.,"That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge."
"This illness is a test of my faith. If it's His will to take me, it doesn't matter where I am. I can accept that.",Does anybody beliEve anything you say?,"I know. Dont be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."
Why is it so difficult for you to beliEve in God?,What I have difficulty with is the whole concept of belief. Faith isn't based on logic and experience.,"Look, cant we just say that you believe in something, and I dont."
"I experience God on a daily basis, and the miracle of life all around. The miracle of birth, the miracle of love. He is always with me.",Where is the miracle in delivering a crack-addicted baby?,Ill tell you everything that I see.
Are you trying to talk me out of my faith?,"You can have all the faith you want in spirits and the afterlife, and heaven and hell, but when it comes to this world, don't be an idiot.","Ok, unless youre not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?"
I don't beliEve He is inside me and is going to save me. I beliEve He is inside me whether I live or die.,Then you might as well live. You've got a better shot betting on me than on Him.,"You believe in your religion, Ill believe in mine."
How'd it go?,She has God inside her. It would have been easier to deal with a tumor.,How come we cant think of something we both want to do?
Maybe she's allergic to God.,We looked Everywhere for an allergen that could be causing this reaction except one place inside her.,"Shes allowed to think its God if she wants, honey!"
On her medical history she didn't mention any surgery.,She had one.,"Pfft... Her chart doesnt indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one."
Can we get her records? What hospital was it at?,She didn't have it at a hospital. Order a full body scan.,"So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital."
What if she refuses?,Tell her I'm looking for a miracle.,Shes not gonna say no.
Oh my God!,"The copper cross, a form of birth control pulled off the market in the 80s.","Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day?"
"So, she's allergic to copper.","Rare, but it happens.",No? Maybe Ill give her a copper tonight and find out.

Do we include sParkzophrenia in the differential for DVT? Well!,The answer is no. Abnormal dopaminergic pathways in the brain do not cause blood clots. SParkzophrenia is not the cause of DVT.,Dr. Dana feels he isnt that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?
The answer is no. Abnormal dopaminergic pathways in the brain do not cause blood clots.

That's not fair.,"Oh, yes it is.",This isnt fair.
You drugged her.,"Actually, I didn't. I've taken her off all medications.",I crushed a pill and put it in her drink.
"Your guy, Foreman, gave her Haldol.",We needed blood for some tests. I assume that was the only way to get it.,Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!
He knocked her out.,"Look I have a cane, and I know how to use it.",He stabbed him in the back.

The Haldol had nothing to do with the bleed. You know that. I used it purely as a chemical restraint.,"Oh, great, well, that's good to hear. So she won't experience any of those pesky little side effects you get when your motives AREN'T pure.",No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence.

What was I supposed to do? Tie her down?,Yeah! Anything but give her drugs that's basically my point!,"Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?"
"If it'd happened at home, she would have died. That ER doc, he was gonna send her home.","It turns out your best judgment is not good enough. Here's an idea next time, use mine.","Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam."
I think they're choosing a movie.,Why did the Patient bleed out?,An acting choice.
The clotting studies so far are normal.,"Well, cover your ears if you don't want me to spoil the ending. Everything was normal, except for prolonged PT time, which means what?",Im ok. Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
"Usually it means, whoEver drew the blood didn't do it right.","Oh, that's right 'cause! you drew the blood. But you were precise, because you knew the tube was purely for the PT study.","Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."
"But you were precise, because you knew the tube was purely for the PT study. That's right.",And I'm right with you.,"Oh, hahaha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!"
Vitamin K would explain the bleed but not the clot.,"Without vitamin K, protein C doesn't work. Without protein C, she clots. Clotting and thinning, all at the same time.",Yeah. The doctor got the K out. He also found an M and an O.
"What about another drug interacting with heparin, an antibiotic like ampicillin? That would !","ClEver, but she's not on ampicillin.",Dont rush it.
"looking at notes Two months ago, she complained of a sore throat. And he got her ampicillin.",Which she refused to take.,"Oh, please, you know, Ill tell you how he did it."
It's more likely than malnourishment. Why not scurvy or the plague?,"Gee, I wish my idea was as cool and with it as yours. What is yours, by the way? Do you have one?","Well, if its not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprungs Disease, botulism, a 30foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms."
"Alcohol. Simple. It causes immobility, which explains the DVT. It also causes cirrhosis which explains the bleed and the prolonged PT time. Let's ultrasound the liver.","Three theories. Check out her place for ampicillin and diet, then ultrasound her liver. Let's find out who's right before she bleeds to death.",Its dehydration. He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
That's the only thing she'll eat.,"Ah. PRoblem is, you can't actually live on this stuff.",What? Shes gonna eat all those cookies?
"I checked it out, I looked on the box, all the nutritional values were solid.","Yeah, vitamin A and C, but no K. That's why your mom got sick.","Oh right. All right, its no fat, its no sugar, its no dairyits no good. Throw it out."
"So, what's the plan?",Load her up with vitamin K.,Whats the plan?
Load her up with vitamin K. That's it?,"If it all checks out, you can take her home in a couple of days. Oh God, you're upset about something. You're gonna open to me now, aren't you?",You never told me why you set me free.

My mom doesn't like them either.,Smart Woman.,Uhhuh... why... do you not like them?
"Before she got sick, I didn't like how bossy she was, always telling me what to do, the right way to do it. NEver thought I'd miss that. lifting backpack, wrist pain Ah!",You should get that looked at.,"The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her."

He has no discretion. Five point eight centimeters is past the surgical guidelines.,Would he do it at 4.6?,I dont care.
"Why don't we just say it's zero, then we don't need him at all. Tumors grow, they don't shrink.",This one does.,"MmKay, Well, it cant be zero, Kev."
"Good morning, Dr. House!","Good morning, Dr. Cuddy! Love that outfit. Says, I'm professional, but I'm still a Woman. Actually, it sorta yells the second part.",Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?

She could be sick and depressed?,"She's sick! Dammit, why didn't I think of that?",Id like to know.
Hypersomnia and personality changes point toward the brain.,"Not the spleen. Thank goodness we hired a neurologist! Brain symptoms! hmm, could this be a brain pRoblem?",Its true. Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.
You mean she claims she's nEver been outside the U.S.,Very good.,"I shouldnt be surprised, I suppose."
"Doesn't matter, blood and c-sub smears show no sign of parasites.",Has to be a tumor then.,Its not sterile!
"A tumor sitting directly on top of the brain stem? That three ER doctors, two neurologists, and a radiologist missed?",Partridge in a pear tree missed it too.,"You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, were forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else."
"Partridge in a pear tree missed it too. Redo the blood work and get a new MRI with 2 millimeter cuts through the mesodiencephalic. leaves the office, calls out as he leaves And check for evil stepmothers. This much sleep usually indiCates poisoned apples.",Anything else beside the shortness of breath?,Well maybe hes just taking a nap.
"Not really, its actually just kind of a tightness.",You smoke?,No. It just feels like pressure.
"You smoke? No, nEver.",Exercise?,"Yeah, but I dont smoke."
Eight hours a day. House looks amazed I teach preschool.,Sounds fun. Any history of heart disease in your family?,"The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months."
Not that I know of.,pulls out a stethoscope Take a deep breath. Been under a lot of stress lately?,No! If there was I wouldnt tell you.
None more than usual.,"You're pRobably just a little anemic, but I'm going to do an EKG just to make sure.","I dont know, I can imagine quite a bit!"
indicating her hospital gown Do I need to take this off?,"No, you can just pull that down in front. she does so. He turns around to see that she is very well-endowed Good. Lord. Are those real?",She doesnt want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so Im going to lay her down in the back of my neighbours van.
Do they look real?,They look! pretty damn good.,"Sorry, Michael, I dont think theyre real."
They were a present for my husband's 40th . I figured he'd enjoy them more than a sweater.,That's so sweet.,"Well, its a fun sweater, its got a bold geometric print."
Well. That's what breasts look like.,Is a lie a lie if Everybody knows it's a lie?,"Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small."
"Well, if a tree pretends to fall in a forest! House, come on, they're breasts. They're a birthday present, not a philosophical treatise.","Lie number one, she did not do that for her husband, she did that for herself. She thinks if she looks different, she'll be different.","Yeah, cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
"No, she thinks if she looks different, she'll be more attractive, which, I have to say!",Not to her husband. Cosmetic surgery is so that Everyone else will look at us differently. Same reason you're wearing that tie.,"No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault."
"Well exactly, that was going to be my next point.","Last three months, same five ties. Thursday should be that paisley thing.","Yeah, thats basically what I said."
It's a gift from my wife.,No its not. Julie hates green. You bought that yourself. You want to look pretty. At work. singsong Wilson's got a girlfriend!,"Honey, Im a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this."
"It takes TWO department heads to treat shortness of breath? What, do the complications increase exponentially with cup size?",I want an EKG and blood tests including tox screen on Mrs.! Exam Room 1.,It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery
You're ordering tests to cover your lechery. Interesting.,Very tricky case. to Wilson You love Everybody. That's your pathology.,That goes directly to the tester.
A small glioma could hide from contrast. We could do a PET scan.,"Yes, that's how a responsible doctor would waste his time in the situation.",And its not just an MRI.
Suddenly tests and radiologists aren't capable of error?,"A glioma not presenting on a contrast MRI would have to be smaller than a grain of sand, which does not a gravely ill person make.","Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when theyre afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything."
Late stage Lyme Disease can cause seizures.,Does the husband care about her?,"No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so."
He hasn't left her bedside.,Now way! it also means she doesn't have Lyme Disease.,"Oh, hes catching up to her!"
What? Love conquers all?,Lyme Disease initially presents with a rash. Mr. Clingy would have noticed.,Love suffers long and is kind.
Did you look at her breasts?,Pff. Men.,"Yeah, look. Breasts and everything."
Could be paraneoplastic.,She have any family history of breast cancer?,"Umm, well, what else could it be?"
Her mother died of it.,"to Foreman The brain, but not the brain. ClEver, huh?",I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss.
A lot has changed since your mom died. Don't worr-- don't give up.,No tumor?,Really? Because your mother is dead.
And how do you treat it if there's no tumor?,"You don't. Those twelve percent, no treatment. They were too busy looking for the tumor, right till they put the Patient in the ground.","Cmon, theres nothin to see, its just a tiny bump, its totally useless."
What choice do we have?,Treat the symptoms. IV Immunoglobulin,We have our decision.
So we're just going to ignore the tumor?,Eventually it'll get bigger. Then it'll be really easy to find. One of you needs to check out where she works.,"Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it."
One of you needs to check out where she works. Why?,Cause the husband's not sick.,"She works here too, how is that any different?"
"If it's not paraneoplastic and it is a reaction to some sort of toxin, it's obviously not coming from their home.","Foreman, you do it.","Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!"
Why are you riding me?,It's what I do! has it gotten worse lately?,to Olly Get me to the top!
Yeah. Seems to me.,Really. Well that rules out the race thing. Cause you were just as black last week.,That is not how it seems to me.
We had to sedate her.,You gave sedatives to a Patient who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?,Oh we just put her down for a nap.
It was better than letting her scratch all the skin off her arms.,Where's Wilson?,"Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin!"
Onset immediately after IVIG isn't.,There is a simple explanation. Maybe she really has bugs under her skin.,"No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now."
Maybe she really has bugs under her skin. Infection?,That's what the worsening of symptoms after immunotherapy would suggest.,I believe shes experiencing her menses.
Blood cultures and the timeline rule out most bacteria.,If a Patient throws up on your shoes do you clean up most of it?,"Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses."
"The symptoms rule out the rest. Serology rules out viruses, CSS smears rule out parasites.",In the final stage of African Trypanosomiasis almost all the parasites are inside the brain. It's possible they wouldn't show on smears.,When Ive seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart.
But it's not possible for a Patient who's nEver been to Africa to have African Sleeping Sickness.,I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.,"You dont cure it by dying, either."
She could have got it from a transfusion.,Or I'm just saying she could have got it from a transfusion.,Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
Which she nEver had.,glares at her Okay!,I thought she just had one.
"Maybe she ignored it, figured she had a cold.","We rejected Lyme Disease because the couple would have noticed a rash, but a wet hacking cough is just going to slip right by?",Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
"Hey, it's either that or she missed her exit on the turnpike and wound up in Africa.","Two lousy ideas. Unfortunately they're better than all the other ideas. Tularemia. Bizarre. Very nice. That's why I ride you. goes into his own office, turns on the TV","For what its worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport."
By safer you mean the one that's slightly less likely to kill her?,Foreman got the gang testing for Tularemia?,"Oh yeah, this is much better."
Foreman got the gang testing for Tularemia? Yep.,"PRobably inconclusive, but worth doing. So what's her name? When do I get to meet her?","No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot."
There's nobody. Give it up.,"Your lips say no, your shoes say yes.","Dont worry, theres no one out here."
Well they're French. You can't trust a word they say.,"Solid, yet stylish.","Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
I'm not gonna date a Patient's daughter.,"Very ethical. Of course, most married men would say they don't date at all.","So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
"There was no date! House glares I had lunch with one of the nurses. It's her first time in an oncology unit and she's having a tough time, emotionally.",Perfect.,Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
I wanted to be nice. That's all. I mean it.,You always do. It's part of your charm.,That was nice of you.
"enters Hi boys. Mrs. Campbell's test results. they keep their faces blank Oh, you remember her, the preschool teacher with the heart of silicon.","Nope, doesn't ring a bell.",I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay.
"They came in yesterday, I figured you guys would have been all over them. I know how concerned you are.","to Wilson She's all upset because we paid more attention to the other girl. You check out her ass, I've got the chest.",Stay sharp! There are two more coming in theyre going to try to cut us off.
"The tests were normal. Course that's just my opinion, you may want to call a couple of guys from maintenance in for a consult.",to Wilson You check her EKG results before she left the other day?,"Well, I dont think theres any reason to check em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain."
You ordered it.,You're the responsible one.,"Oh, I ordered mine first."
What's wrong? They look normal to me.,to Cuddy Where is she?,Whats the matter with them?
"Waiting downstairs, why?",I was right.,Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
Do I have to get rid of the implants?,"Surprisingly, no. But your EKG shows a slightly decreased heart rate.",Will you be able to milk with those implants?
Is that a pRoblem?,"You told me you hadn't changed your diet or exercise, were you lying?","Yes. What, is there a problem?"
"You told me you hadn't changed your diet or exercise, were you lying? Lying?",Does your husband have high blood pressure?,Well you lost zero pounds.
Does your husband have high blood pressure? My husband?,"Yeah.. see, if you're gonna repeat Everything I say this conversation is gonna take twice as long.","Howard, Im so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts."
"Yes, he was diagnosed six moths ago!",He do a lot of cooking at home?,Yeah. Its a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. Hes gonna do it next week.
"Not really, other than oatmeal in the morning.",Did you happen to notice a slightly odd taste to the oatmeal lately?,"So, there was talk of oatmeal."
"Wait, are you saying that--",That it looks like your husband stirred in some of his blood pressure medication along with brown sugar.,"Wow, youre just going to make me come out and say it, arent you?"
You think my husbands trying to poison me?!,"No, nothing like that.","You didnt poison me, its just stress."
You should have gotten him the sweater. That's ridiculous.,"Fine. But if you're still concerned about the shortness of breath, I'd start making your own breakfast. opens the door to leave",And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
Wait! What should I do?,"Well, if you care about your husband at all, I'd do the responsible thing buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find! seems to realize something Huh. leaves","Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did."
"Well, if you care about your husband at all, I'd do the responsible thing buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find! seems to realize something Huh. leaves",Lab tests inconclusive?,"Thats right. Youre husbands home. So, now the sex can stop."
Lab tests inconclusive? Not surprisingly.,"No. Too bad. Luckily, I have the answer. pause",Yes! Maybe its a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
pause To what?,Thanks for asking. The life itself. Sex. Anything that can be transmitted via the blood can be transmitted through sex.,"Hey, if youre pausing for dramatic effect, Id keep it moving."
Sleeping sickness from sex?,It's not without precedent.,Because of sex?
I'm pretty sure it is. Unless you're talking about going to Africa and having sex with the tse tse fly.,A Portuguese Man was diagnosed three years ago with CNS affected sleeping sickness. His only connection with Africa was through a girlfriend who served under the military in Angola.,"Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cowmeat. Strictly taboo."
"Oi, where'd you find that",The Journal de Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical. You don't read Portuguese?,Where the hell dyou find that?
You don't read Portuguese? You do?,I'm pretty sure that's what it said. Either that or it was an ad for sunglasses.,"Like okay III, I havent met any Portuguese people!"
Her husband has nEver been to Africa either.,"Ooh, stymied again. Your logic is bulletproof.",I never went to Thailand.
I think ignoring respiratory symptoms is more likely than cheating.,Because?,"Okay, first of all, I dont play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!"
They're completely devoted to each other.,Because?,You mean theyre lovers.
They love each other.,Or?,Are they in love?
They're overcompensating for guilt.,to Cameron Find out which it is.,"Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad."
You want me to ask a Man whose wife is about to die if he cheated on her?,"No, I want you to be polite and let her die.","Yeah, do you want to break a dying womans heart?"
You don't trust me to do my job?,We all formulate questions based on the answers we want to hear.,I cant believe you dont trust me.
And how exactly do you re-formulate Have you screwed around?,Did you know she's been trying to get pregnant?,"Then, youre redoing it because."
Did you know she's been trying to get pregnant? Yes.,After you got so freaked about the sick babies a while ago I figured that was your thing.,"You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?"
You pulled my medical records?,"You coughed the other day, I was concerned.",And I told you I wanted to see a doctors note.
You were curious. Like an eight-year old boy with a puzzle that's just a little too grown-up for him to figure out. stalks off,"To-MAY-to, to-MAH-to!",You seemed confused.
Absolutely not. I love her,Alright then.,"Nope, shes perfect."
I don't know. looks at the monitor! realizes! She's in a coma.,There's only one way a Tularemia Patient goes into a coma while on IV-Chloramphenicol.,"Well shes, shes the kinda girlJoey was unconscious."
The Patient doesn't have Tularemia.,And then there was one. Patient comes in because she's sleeping too much. It takes ten doctors and a coma to diagnose sleeping sickness.,"Yeah, right. Sick. He didnt have jaundice. He just looks like that."
And then there was none. We still have the pRoblem of explaining how a white Parkck from Jersey who's nEver traveled south of D.C. has African sleeping sickness.,"Well, the obvious explanation?",It didnt have anything to do with race.
"I made it clear. If this guy's lying about sleeping around, he knows he's murdering his wife.",Does seem unlikely! Go away. he enters Elise's room,You talked to the man whose wife youre having an affair with.
Does seem unlikely! Go away. he enters Elise's room,"lifts Elise's arms, drops them","Ahh, whoohoo!!He runs back out the door."

Who are you?,I'm Dr. House. Your wife has huMan African Trypanosomiasis. Ed looks puzzled Sleeping sickness.,We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear.
"You mean its not Tularemia. A virus, tumor or- or cancer.",Nope.,Ok. Thats to broad. Its gotta be something else. How bout your stomach? Yeah? Meredith?
I've nEver had an affair.,I beliEve you.,"Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with."
And I trust Elise.,The treatment for this disease is a drug that's!,And you trust Cersei
Why would she lie if she knew it could kill her?,"I don't ask why Patients lie, I just assume they all do.","I dont get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?"
"I don't ask why Patients lie, I just assume they all do. But why?","To protect you, because she didn't think it mattered.",They lie so they dont look petty.
I don't know! pause,I'll start the treatment.,I dont know!
So we're treating her for African sleeping sickness because you don't think it's possible for someone to be faithful in a relationship?,And you do?,Shes sleeping with you?
And you do? Yes.,And you need to tell me that?,"Actually, yes. I do."
"Look I'm not having an affair. I had lunch, with someone I work with, at work. Once.",I beliEve you. What I don't beliEve is that it'll be just once.,"For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity."

Reinitiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten eleven. Its a good thing I didnt send that letter."
I'm not crying.,Ok. long pause,Im not crying Im just sweating.

His tox screen was negative. He's still whacked out,You don't care about the kid. You just find his illness intriguing.,"Yeah, hes fine, hes just a little rattled."

That's what you wanna hear. Not in the slightest,Me neither. about the notes Means we'll be objective,No. Not at all.

"Same school, different grades, different cliques, different Everything.",They Managed to get poisoned together they must have something in common.,Its not like wewe know each other or anything.
Their classes aren't in the same building. They don't Even eat lunch in the same lunchroom.,How do they get to school?,Yknow your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
"Well, it took you long enough. We've been waiting!",Could you step outside a minute?,Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Could you step outside a minute? Why?,Because you irritate me.,I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
"He is my son, doctor. He's just a little cranky from not eating.","Fine. Mrs. Adams, have you had any recent sexual activity?","Oh, hes at the doctor, he didnt poop the whole time we were there!"
"Not in bed, dear. To House Why do you ask?",Because you have tested positive for syphilis.,In the bed.
That's impossible. And insulting!,I don't think it's the first time Mom's heard this diagnosis.,No. No. Thats not true! Thats impossible!
"Cupid's disease, that what we used to call it.",When did you get it?,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease Ive ever had."
He was. We're talking about sex. to House I was treated.,"Which suppressed it. In your case, for 60 years. But now it's back, and the spirochetes that cause syphilis are eating away at your brain cells.",It wasnt. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
Oh! That's revolting.,"It's not as revolting as ChlAmydia that's got seepage. And it's the 21st century. We've got flying cars, talking dogs, and penicillin. High-dose regimen for two weeks, you're cured.","I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnt for fun."
I don't beliEve it.,"Yeah, well, pinch yourself.",I dont believe it.
I guess for the next two weeks I'd better practice safe sex.,You'll be fine. Just feed that cranky kid.,"Okay, just so you know, Im gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so dont touch yourself in the next 48 hours."
The county's worried about West Nile so they sprayed ethyl parathion right next to the bus route.,Do you have the hydrolase for ethyl parathion?,What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
"Yep. Only one pRoblem. Matt's mom faxed his record to the CDC, and she refuses to let us do anything till she hears back from them.",You're getting good at this God-like doctor thing. Why don't you talk her out of it?,"Yeah, but we havent heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!"
not a big fan of mine. Or mine.,Only one Man left in the bullpen and he throws like a girl.,Do you want to look at mine?
I hate sports metaphors.,Give her the high hard one.,A sports metaphor?
"Their hearts are barely pumping. Their lungs are shot, now they're showing liver toxicity.",I guess Matt's mom won't nominate us for any Doctor of the Year awards.,"Ah. Theyre as strong as theyre gonna get. Them thats dying, why dont you cut their throats and be done with it? Hmm? Or leave them if youve not the stomach and Ill sort them myself."
The only thing they have in common is the bus.,"Except their symptoms. Given their sEverity, in fact their cardiac symptoms are getting worse much faster than all their other ones, what does that tell us?","I can see that, cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin."
Poison was pRobably absorbed through the skin.,They were admitted at 845 and 1100. When were they poisoned?,"Of all the ways Id kill you, poison would be the last."
"In a case that bad, more like 1 1/2 to 4.","So, Matt was poisoned before 715. Before he got on the bus.",Really? Id say 3 to 4.
You think each kid got poisoned in his own House? Two separate exposures?,What do teenage boys do in the morning? Besides the obvious?,"Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You cant expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, its just a different sensation."
"Wake up! go to the bathroom, and! the obvious. Then check their zits in the mirror.",Do they use the same acne cream?,Do some research.
"Because acne cream contains lanolin, which could have pesticides, and you're thinking they both bought the same product which-",Could be contaminated. Shaving cream?,"Oh, not another one!"
Park doesn't look like he shaves.,He sweats.,I dont think Jim cares about his hair.
Deodorant could contain lanolin.,These people have pets?,Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.
"Fleas, flea powder.",Ok.,"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"
And I'm running low on tomato sauce. Dr. House!,I sent you home.,"I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!"
I came back. I took a cab so my son wouldn't try to chaperone us this time.,"I'm sorry, but the fact that the sexual pleasure center of your cerebral cortex has been over-stimulated by spirochetes is a poor basis for a relationship.","Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way."
"Look, Dr. House, these feelings that's I've been having. Is it all because of the syphilis?",Yes.,from the syphilis.
"Then here's the prescription you gave me. House looks puzzled Well, it's not like I'm going to infect anyone.","No, but it'll kill you.","Okay, okay, heres the deal."
"Well, you gotta go sometime. And I really don't want to play canasta for the rest of my life. I! I like feeling sexy again. And making a fool out of myself with handsome young doctors.",Do you think I would have given you this if it would stop you from flirting with me?,Whoawhoawhoawhoa! I dont want to go. Im having fun.
But if I'm cured?,The spirochetes will die off.,And then youll be saved.
Oh! Oh! thank you! Leans to kiss him,Georgia!,"Ohh, give him a kiss for me!"
"When I stop being contagious, I'll come back for a checkup. Mega-wink",Yeah!,Exactly how contagious is this thing you have?
Matt's ALTs are up to 800. If they get any higher we can toss his liver.,cell phone goes off Yeah?,"Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot."
Or any other kind of deodorant.,What about shampoo?,"Its kinda smelly, but that might be a plus!"
"No to shampoo bar soap, dish soap, dish detergent!",What about laundry detergent? Maybe they both washed their clothes this morning?,Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
"If we cure Matt, he can use his close brush with death on his college essays. Admission guys love that stuff.","That's how you got in, right? Jail House diaries?","Let me tell you something, Oscar."
-environmentally safe formula. It's the same!,Bring in the detergent. hangs up,It tastes the same.
So the detergent was contaminated with pesticides?,Soaked into their clothes and got absorbed into their skin!,Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?
"He washed them this morning, right? What?",Nice respectful Asian kid does the laundry.,Think he washed his hands?
My wife said he didn't.,"Then I'm guessing he washed them last night, without you knowing.","Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I cant let you go."
NEver washed. Now what?,What about Matt's clothes? They new?,You dont wanna wash that.
"They're ruddy old jeans, I think. They've been bagged up and taken downstairs.",Davis.,Theyre my pants!
Yep they're Matt's. And they're old,"And yet the label isn't faded in the slightest. Fake old. 100 dollars for the homeless look. What, kids aren't pretentious in England?","So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here?"
"Park's are a different brand, how could they both be contaminated?",That is a question for the ages. In the meantime get these tests in.,"Well, cause I got it at the dirty store."
I nEver bother to wash new clothes before I wear them.,"Right, your wife does. She wants you to feel nice and comfortable.","Well, not myself, but I know other people that have."
"Hey! I'm a Man. I don't have time for laundry, I'm saving lives here. No, she doesn't wash them either.","So your skin absorbs a little dye, the odd chemical here and there!","Time to do your laundry, huh?"
"Well, you know me. Always living on the edge. Enter Foreman and Chase","Judging by the self importance of your strut, you have identified the chemical in question.","See, this is the brilliance of the show."
"Judging by the self importance of your strut, you have identified the chemical in question. Phosmet.",Hit him with the hydrolase.,Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
Park's parents said yes but-,Mighty mom said no. She's gonna feel like million bucks when Park lives and her son dies. Send Cameron. She's the only one who's Managed to talk her into anything.,"So I told Carl, Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur."
What is this?!,"Thought I'd hang out in case you change your mind! and I can give Matt the medicine right away. Don't worry, I've got time.","Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!"
The CDC promised they'd call.,They will.,They could call at any second now.
What makes you think you're right this time?,"Same reason as last time. You wanna see how the other kid does first, that's ok. Might help you. But there's a real good chance that-","Yknow what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong."
What? Matt might kick off?,"A little blunt! I was gonna say run out of time, or just sort of let my voice trail off! Mom's cell goes off",What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
"Hello? ! Yes this is Margo Davis. ! But you have his records I sent them. ! Yes, I understand. hangs up They can't help me.",They haven't seen him. Can't make a decision based on-,Do you know this man?
"hands House a cell phone. In a fake Southern accent- The CDC is unable to give an opinion at this time, and! we're gonna have a doctor in your area next week.",You fooled her with that?,"Well, heres your phone doctor."
"Some guy was selling pants off the back of his truck near the school. When he wasn't busy as a clothing entrepreneur, he did daily at the cornfield over by route one. Used the same truck for both jobs.","Spilled pesticides on the pants, didn't bother to clean up. So, why are you still here? Why aren't you out there making up with the joyful mother?","Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff."
Why would I do that?,"No reason at all, you don't care about her or her son.","Yeah. Hey, heres an idea, why dont we use our wedding china today?"
"Oh, Dr. House. The CDC called. Again.",Oops.,"Come on, everyone to the hospital."
"Call an ambulance! Now! Someone in the recording booth does so, as John stops moving.",I want in.,"Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?"
"John Henry Giles, you a fan of his music?","He's a musician? That paralysis thing, guy can't walk for two years and nobody knows why, that seems mildly interesting.",Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
Forget his paralysis.,Tell that to the rest of his bowling team.,And his obsessivecompulsive disorder.
"As far as this hospital is concerned, this is a simple case of lobar pneumonia. Boring.","But that not walking thing, that could turn into something serious!",Dont come to the hospital.
Marty Hamilton is his primary physician out in California. He's dealing with the paralysis.,"Know all about it. Multiple treatments, multiple surgeries. Making real progress. Fixed Everything but the legs.","Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now."
"Dr. Hamilton already called and asked for your team. And by team, I don't mean you.","Like I always say, there's no I in team. There is a me, though, if you jumble it up. They leave her office.","I have already picked my team Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking."
Foreman did his residency with Hamilton.,I know. I did accidentally glance at his resume before I hired him.,"Well, yeah, hed been living with Sheldon."
He wants someone he can trust.,He must have spoken to Foreman's parole Officer.,I want to see what he wants first.
Someone who will stick to the pneumonia. John Henry's on an experimental protocol for the paralysis.,I respect that. I'm not going to get in his way.,"Oh, was it, uh, Dr."
It's Foreman's case. She walks away.,"It's pneumonia, he can handle it. Guy's already paralyzed, how badly can he screw it up?",Doesnt matter. Hes headed for the kitchen anyway.
"Dr. House, is there anything back from Micro?",Not yet. You gonna fire me?,"Any follow up, Amy?"
You can make up for it by washing my car.,"Oh, this is fun. Chase smiles.","I wont. But, you will wash and buff our car."
"Let's keep him on the broad-spectrum antibiotics, and since he's displaying septic physiology, draw blood for adrenal and thyroid function. Cameron and Chase stand up, but House's feet resting on the table block their path.",How about the paralysis?,"Another hospital room, Joey has now been admitted and his doctor is about to break the bad news to him, Monica, and Chandler."
We're sticking to the pneumonia.,"Well, you certainly are, boss. Like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice. Chase and Cameron sit.","Right, Im gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh."
The paralysis has already been diagnosed by Dr. Hamilton. It's ALS.,"Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a lovely diagnosis. They make movies about it. No tests, no treatment. It's a disease of exclusion",This poor guys been in a coma for five years.
-- because Hamilton has excluded Everything else.,I haven't. He gets up and takes the board marker from Foreman. What else could it be?,"Alright, wait, so what youre saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not?"
"Guillain-Barre, which would be rEversible.","Excellent. He starts to write, but Foreman takes the marker away from him.","According to a recent survey, this is the most common learning disability among American adolescents."
Antibodies could be attacking the nerve. Multifocal motor neuropathy.,"Uncommon, but it fits. It's also treatable. Did Hamilton try putting the guy on IVIG?",The cause appears to be manticore venom.
"No, because the MRI showed","Well, let's do an MRI of our own. Chase and Cameron get up.","No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!"
Guys? It's my case. They sit down again. ALS fits. It Even predicts the pneumonia. The paralysis is progressive.,It's a death sentence.,"No, no, no."
He signed a DNR.,takes headphones off He rhymes with dinner?,Theres a reciprocity clause.
He signed a DNR.,Oh. That makes more sense. You tell him it might not be ALS?,What? I didnt sign it yet.
You tell him it might not be ALS? No.,"Well, no wonder he signed. Who wouldn't?","Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that hes a good man and that I hope he feels better."
I started him on IV steroids and ancinthroid. sp?,"Great. If it was my case, I'd be adding a little IVIG to the mix.","Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball."
For his pneumonia?,That's my story and I'm sticking to it.,"Hes under sedation, so hes pretty much out."
He doesn't want anything done. No treatment.,"DNR means do not resuscitate, not do not treat.","I know, I wish there was some way we could help him."
"My nature isn't what it used to be. The little Man has lost some bounce in his step. House looks like he's trying to looks sympathetic. He needs to crank it up, have himself some fun this weekend. confidentially He wants the blue pills.",You're talking about your penis in the third person.,"I dont get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday."
"Me and him, two people.",Separate vacations?,"Actually, its the three of us."
You need to up your insulin to chocolate Parkp ice cream lEvels. Insulin?,"Yeah, you remember.",I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today.
My pants tell you I have diabetes?,"No, they tell me you're an idiot.",I have diabetes too.
You're giving me the pills?,"Sure, why not?",I want some of those pills.
"Someone likes music. Oh, yeah.",His stats are in the 70s. How long has he been like this?,"What kind of music are you into, Peter?"
How long has he been like this? 10 minutes.,"Well, why aren't you doing",How long can he keep this up?
The IVIG put him into respiratory failure.,You put him on the IVIG?,Howd he die?
We did this.,So undo it! Chase!,"Yeah, we did it."
It's too late! We killed him.,"Nobody killed him! He's not dead! Chase, intubate him!","I, I killed him."
What are you doing? You can't do this!,Bag.,Im tellin you.
You can't do this!,Bag! He grabs the bag himself and starts to ventilate. Cora walks in. He had a bad reaction to some medicine we gave him.,When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind.
He's stable on the ventilator. Oxygenating well.,"The IVIG made him worse, which means multifocal motoneuropathy was a bad diagnosis. Okay, what's really wrong with him?","Hes doing just fine, hes resting now, but you can see him in a little bit."
What's wrong with you?,Everyone knows what's wrong with me. What's wrong with him is much more interesting.,"Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa."
You tubed him and he didn't wanna be tubed! He has a legal paper saying just that.,"To intubate or not to intubate, that is the big ethical question. Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it, maybe just practice some medicine.","Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village."
There's no question. It's the Patient's decision,"-- if the Patient is competent to make it, if his thyroid numbers aren't making him sad.","A disease doesnt decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does."
It's nothing. Do not defend him.,Why did he sign that DNR?,"Oh, its nothing, its a little thing."
I didn't talk him into,"No, he signed the DNR 'cause he didn't want a slow and painful death from ALS. What was happening to him had nothing to do with his ALS.","Well, I told him I would think about it, but Im gonna tell him no."
"Right! Exactly! It's the IVIG, you screwed up! You're not gonna let him die because you screwed up!","Technically, your case. You screwed up. Is that what this is about? Looking bad in front of your old boss?","I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life."
You assaulted that Man.,Fine. I'll nEver do it again.,I hit him.
"Yes, you will.",All the more reason this Debate is pointless. Foreman leaves.,"In the bedrooms of tenyearold girls, where they belong."
All the more reason this Debate is pointless. Foreman leaves.,"His lungs are worse. Any theories? Cameron looks to see where Foreman went. Oh, I'm sure he just went to the little boys' room. Come on, people.","And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions."
"Come on, people. Uh, vasculitis?",Wouldn't likely hit both lungs.,Alicia Sky Varinaitis
Dr. House? House looks surprised.,"Cuddy sent me a stripper again? Ah, love that Woman. So thoughtful.","Dr. Rhodess Office, a rather large group of doctors has now gathered to take a look at Rosss thing. Ross is none too pleased with the developments, he has a disgusted look on his face."
There are case reports of Wegener's hitting both the legs and the spine.,"Well, it's not great, but it's better than ALS. At least it's treatable.","Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess."
"looking at the paper It's a restraining order. You're not to come within 50 feet of John Henry Giles, and they've asked the DA to file criminal charges for battery. slight pause","Cameron, test the blood for c-ANCA.","Well, the contents are irrelevant."
These are criminal charges. They aren't going to let you take blood to make more tests.,"He has blood left in the lab, just add on the c-ANCA. to Chase Foreman's still got you doing bronParkoscopic suctioning for the pneumonia?","Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing."
Every four hours.,"Well, while you're down in his lungs, grab a biopsy. We'll need it to confirm Wegener's. And move the Patient to the second floor ICU.","Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day?"
And move the Patient to the second floor ICU. Why?,It's right above the clinic.,For an emergency just like this.
It's right above the clinic. I'm pretty sure it's 50 feet in any direction. It's nice having a court order saying you don't have to work clinic duty. He goes and sits in his office.,yelling Dr. Cuddy!,Dr Gallos office.
to Patients Excuse me.,You paged me.,To your health.
Why the yelling?,"His bed is behind that wall. The plaintiff's. I can't, you know, come any closer.","Howard, why is he yelling at me?"
It's right over the clinic. Very cute.,"Can we get the lecture over with, because I've got a, actually, I've got nothing to do. Take your time.","Yeahyeah, its this huge place, andand its got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic."
You need a Lawyer?,You don't have a pRoblem with what I did?,You have your lawyer there?
"When I hired you, I knew you were insane. I will continue to try and stop you from doing insane things, but once they're done!. Trying to convince an insane person not to do insane things is, in itself, insane, so when I hired you I also set aside $50,000 a year for legal expenses. So far you've come in under budget.",Great. Any chance you could help me run some tests?,"Ive watched you screw up this office for ten years, and Im filing a lawsuit, and Im gonna tell them about every stupid thing youve ever done up in this office."
Dr. Foreman called Dr. Hamilton. He's flying in from L.A.,You can talk to him.,"Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly."
Dr. Hamilton is flying in as a friend of John Henry's to pull the plug. pause,Yeah. I need a Lawyer.,"Oh, Danny just went into room 217."
Dr. House is alleged to have forced a tube down Mr. Giles' throat against his will. House stands up.,"A medical tube, saving his life.","Theres something else, my lord."
"Dr. House, please let your attorney speak for you. House's attorney makes a noise in the back of his throat.","I'm sorry, your Honor. I was way out of line. He sits.",Id like to refer that to my attorney.
Why are you doing this? It's not going to keep you out of jail.,No.,Youre not going to prison.
"Even if you win, the restraining order and battery charge stay in place. What have you gained?",Time.,I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
To diagnose him? You can't get near him!,I don't want to get near him.,Lets see if he needs help.
"You know how some doctors have the Messiah complex, they need to save the world? You've got the Rubik's complex, you need to solve the puzzle.","Are you done, or do you have more references to 1980s fads?",Seriously? He invented the Rubiks Cube.
"The DNR order was witnessed by Dr. House's own staff, a, a Dr. Foreman. House stands.","My staff are idiots. I'm sure you know what it's like, your Honor.","Yeah, hes head of the department."
And this poor guy has gotta stay on life support until we can schedule a trial. House stands.,Your Honor,Who will stand judge?
"Dr. House, I will hold you in contempt if you don't sit down.",I have a medical issue.,"Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat."
If it pertains to this case your attorney should,It doesn't. Do you have any history of heart disease in your family? Giles' attorney scoffs.,"No. Im not a lawyer, but I dont think this is the place to do this."
Giles' attorney scoffs. Your Honor!,"Your fingers. They show signs of clubbing, which indiCate a health pRoblem. Remember Bart Giamotti? Same thing, just dropped dead one day. Please see your doctor.","Ive taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, lets face it, youre somewhat of a loose cannon."
He's admitted this isn't relevant. Can we please get back to the motion?,"Of course, I'm sorry. He sits.",Hey. No movement.
"Congratulations, impressive legal argument.",I watched Matlock last night. He pulls off his tie.,"No, no. You gave me an explanation, its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers."
"Oh, say no more. I didn't notice any clubbing on the Judge's fingers.",Neither did I.,"Judge rules, no violation."
"So, the family history thing!",Every family has some history of heart disease.,Ive done a little genealogy research of my own.
Biopsy only shows inflammation.,Start him on Cytoxan.,That was just the cotton swab.
You're diagnosing Wegener's based on a little inflammation?,"Well, unfortunately I think we've exhausted all the tests we can do in the capacity as the doctors he doesn't want doing tests on him.",To...you cant do that. No one gave you any orders.
But you don't --,We'll know I'm right if he starts walking.,"Oh you dont, thats"
"You can't do any more tests, but you want me to treat him?","The medicine's in the pharmacy, Patient's immobilized in the ICU. Sounds like a simple geography pRoblem.","No. No one else will try, so Im the best youve got. Have a seat. Im going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the"
Can I help you?,"Uh, I'm Dr. House, I'm","Ohh, no, no."
"I'd appreciate any list of medications, anything like that.",I've started him on Cytoxan.,"My brother, the PhD would like to know if theres any way to treat this orally."
"For Wegener's, right? Look, Gregg. I checked you out, you know? I know you're a good doctor. You have to appreciate that I'm a good doctor, too.",Why?,So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
"Wegener's is one of the first things I looked for. The biopsy and the blood tests were negative, just like yours.","There's an error rate, Marty.",What might this be?
"It's not your fault, Eric.","No, it's mine. Eric.",Its not your fault.
How's the old place doing? They start to chat.,"Oh, this is wonderful. They stop chatting. But before you guys break out the oil, I should point out you can't pull the plug I have a court order.","All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then well go across the hall and say hi to everyone."
"You used to, but",I have the right to face my accuser. Judge said so.,"Yeah, well, sadly, I do."
Not if no one's accusing you. All the charges have been dropped.,He doesn't have to die.,But you were accused.
It's not Wegener's.,"If it's Wegener's, his lungs won't be able to handle it. As soon as they pull that plug he'll die.","You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant."
He's still breathing.,It's not Wegener's. Wrong again. He walks off.,"Oh, he blinked his eyes."
"He's stable, but one of his arms is now paralyzed.","The real question is, why is he still alive?",Hes fine. Hes indestructible.
He's alive because you were wrong. It's not Wegener's.,"Yeah, seem to be doing that a lot, lately. People keep living because of my mistakes.",All right. Are we good? Youre okay. Hes okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
Progression of the paralysis pretty much confirms Hamilton was right. It's ALS.,Assuming this is a progression of his paralysis.,"Its hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it."
He can't move his arm.,"Yes, his arm is paralyzed.","Yeah, I cant."
How about this one? He's not our Patient.,"Nope, not good enough.",Hes not my prisoner.
"He could have suffered a stroke when he was intubated. Foreman looks at her. Well, blood clots are common in intubated Patients. The inactivity causes",Not interested in why. Let's get an MR-angiogram for an embolic stroke.,"Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years!"
He doesn't want you treating him!,They dropped the court order.,"Pam, hes just not that into you."
"Yeah, and that girl dropped the charges against Kobe. Doesn't mean that he should call her and see if she's free to get a sundae.","Good point, but I can go within 50 feet of him now.","Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway."
"Okay. Hamilton leaves. John starts coughing. House, who was hiding behind a column in the lobby, comes into the room. Get outta here.","Sure. That makes sense. You hate me for saving your life. In fairness to your side, you were also dying because of me, so","Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. Im gonna go out this window. Ill meet you at the front door. Just tell them youre going home, okay?"
You know I didn't wanna be saved.,"That's what's interesting. Your thyroid was low, but not low enough to cause depression.",I dont want it to save me.
"So, you came here to tell me that Even if I can't walk I can still hear the birds sing? Enjoy the rainbow, and feeling the sun shine on my face?",Those things are fun.,Can you walk?
"Yeah, sure. I'll stick around to indulge your obsession. It's over. I lost my air. The session the other night, with those kids? That was a test to see if I could still play. I can't.",And that's all you are? A musician?,"Thank you, thanks."
"I got one thing, same as you.","Really? Apparently, you know me better than I know you.",We want the same things.
"I know that limp. I know the empty ring finger. And that obsessive nature of yours, that's a big secret. You don't risk jail and your career just to save somebody who doesn't want to be saved unless you got something, anything, one thing. The reason normal people got wives and kids and hobbies, whatEver. That's because they don't got that one thing that hits them that hard and that true. I got music, you got this. The thing you think about all the time, the thing that keeps you south of normal. Yeah, makes us great, makes us the best. All we miss out on is Everything else.

"Yeah, but when it's over, it's over.","Yeah. He walks to the door and opens it. Suddenly, he walks back and starts to undo the cords connecting John to the monitors.","And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
What are you doing?,It's not over for me.,"Right, fine, Ill do it, but no talking."
"Listen, listen, I just think it wouldn't hurt him to learn a little humility. We see that House has been standing behind Foreman. Whoops!","So, what's the verdict?",He doesnt love it that much.
There's a good chance we can still bust the clot with tPA.,Do it. See what happens to his arm.,That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
"I don't know, I guess! It's just with Dr. Hamilton here, I notice a difference in styles.",His style involves humility. small pause Another difference in our styles I don't care much for apologies. You can go.,How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
"I didn't know you were standing there when I said that, okay? It was completely rude.","Do you mean genuine humility? You know, with all the self-doubt and the self-questioning, or Hamilton's polite, patronizing Aw, shucks humility?","All right. Go away. I agree, its rude, but she asked for privacy."
You're both excellent doctors.,Thank you. And humility is an important quality. Especially if you're wrong a lot.,"I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN."
You've been wrong Every step of the way.,"Of course, when you're right, self-doubt doesn't help anybody, does it? His beeper goes off. We gotta go.",Good. Lets begin with the premise that everything youve done up to this point is wrong.
"We gotta go. Congratulations, Gregg.","mutters to Foreman Congratulations! aloud Why, Marty?","Sheldon, we have to go."
"Now look, I know we've had our differences, but I think when a person does something well House picks up the phone it ought to be recognized.","The phone works. Next time you want to make me feel all warm and fuzzy, leave a message. He taps John's leg. Don't get me wrong, I'm overcome with joy.","Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman I got the peepers name!"
Doc? Yeah?,What?,"Hes a doctor too, right?"
You just touched my leg.,"What, you gonna charge me with assault again?",Something just brushed up against my right leg!
"No, I felt it.",He now has feeling all the way up to calf.,"You know, I did feel something."
You're saying he just spontaneously got better?,"No, I'm saying let's rule out the lunar god and go from there.","Yeah, OK. Well, he only gets better."
I'm sure he will.,It's one of ours.,I expect he will.
How do we figure out which drug is doing the trick?,Easy. We stop all of them.,"Okay, lets see if this drug works."
One of those drugs is helping him.,"And the rest? Steroids, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, they're toxic if we leave him on all of them.",I think youre focussing entirely too much on the drugs.
He'll walk again.,"Yeah, to his own funeral.",He needs to get his strength back first.
"But if we stop Everything, he'll get worse.","True. And then we'll add our medications back, one at a time. If he gets better, then we'll have our answer.",Is there no way we can get rid of him?
And if he doesn't get better?,Then we're in trouble. Not as much as he is. I suppose that was your point.,"If he cant, we may as well just go without him."
"I assume you want me to convince Hamilton to stop his treatments, too?",Don't care.,You want me to look at him and listen to him?
You know at least five of the medications are part of his protocol?,If his stuff was helping the guy would be playing tennis six months ago. It's our round of treatment that's helping.,"You work in pharmaceuticals, dont you have anything you can give him?"
"So your philosophy is, If they don't want treatment, they get it shoved down their throat, but if it might cure their paralysis, whoa, better slow down.",Yeah.,So... if it worked for him... Lets give the walkers what they want.
What's your philosophy on employee relations?,That's a very tiny pillow.,"So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?"

-- it's a dangerous game.,Only if we're watParkng in the bathtub.,"That is a dangerous game, friendo."
I need to know exactly what medications you were giving John Henry.,Forget it. And if Foreman tells you what John Henry used to be on,Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.
You're gonna fire him?,Nope. Make him live out Every day of his two-year contract.,What are you gonna do?
Foreman asked to leave?,Not yet.,"Listen, youre the one who decided to leave."
But how do you know I made him an,"You're a polite twit, but you're not an idiot.",I made him tell us.
I need to know what medications you've taken him off of.,"Wait a second. You're not an idiot. You need to know what medications I've stopped, because!",All I have is our new urine flow drug.
"Wait a second. You're not an idiot. You need to know what medications I've stopped, because!",He's getting worse. He whacks John's leg with a clipboard. Nothing. to Foreman Right now you still work for me. Come on!,"Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot."

"Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose, it's whether the other guy loses.",What was the first thing we put him on?,Not if you win.
"Steroids, for the pneumonia.","Well, put him back on them. Give them 24 hours, see what happens.",What are you taking amoxicillin for?
His lungs aren't great. It might cause another respiratory collapse.,Sure hope not. I didn't much like that Lawyer. And get an MRI.,What? He said he was fine.
He already got one. And an MRA.,"Well, obviously something is different now. Do it again. Chase, take care of the scan. Cameron, put him on the steroids. to Foreman We should pRobably talk, huh?",Why would he turn off the TV?
"He has to. If he doesn't, he's telling Foreman he needs him. House can't handle that. She looks closely at the screen. Oh, my God!",I checked him out. He's a great doctor. You think he's better than I am?,"Uh, wwhy dont you get it Jerry?"
This about your ego?,Answer the question.,Ive had enough of your condescension.
It's that simple? I should just ignore the mockery and abuse?,"Oh, how do I abuse you?",You should learn to ignore them.
How do you not? If I make a mistake,"I hold you accountable, so what?",But what if I dont?
Dr. Hamilton forgives. He's capable of moving on.,That is not what he does!,Sheldon says hes sorry.
"I screwed up his case, he told me","He nEver said you were forgiven. I was there, he said it wasn't your fault.",He messed with something that was important to you.
"I was there, he said it wasn't your fault. So?","So, it was.",So what did he say?
"Intradural, compressing his spine. Chase puts up the scans.",Causing his paralysis.,Quite a bit of pain.
How could Hamilton have missed an AVM?,"Well, we missed it, too. 'Cause it wasn't there before.","Okay, what was wrong with that call?"
You saying it just grew overnight?,"No. It was on the spine, it wasn't on the MRI. He points to the scan from a few days ago. Same anatomic location.","Its taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth."
It's not there.,"Well, what is there?",Its right there.
"Well, what is there? Nothing.",Or something that looks like nothing.,There isnt thats what Im saying.
"If it's inflammation, the steroids would have shrunk it down.","REvealing the AVM, which has always been there, hiding behind its own swelling. We remove that, he'll walk again.","so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it."
Dr. House! Cora's meeting me outside with a limo. I'm being discharged.,Fifty bucks says I can beat you to the curb. John laughs.,"Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second!"
Thanks for sticking with the case.,I can't do anything else. He takes the Vicodin. You're much more easily amused when you can walk.,"Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do."
How bizarre. I'm guessing you weren't exactly Mr. Sunshine Even before your leg got messed up. John hands House his trumpet as It's a Wonderful World starts to play. Aw. I want you to have this.,Wow.,Your old blind man patched me up.
"You can sell it if you want to, just promise me you won't play it. House smiles. How Many of those pills you taking?",I'm in pain.,"No, look, I told you that I didnt want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway."
"Yeah. Aren't we all? pause So, where do you buy these things, do they have cane stores?","Oh, don't worry about it. You'll be jogging before you need a second one. Foreman comes out a side door. See you tomorrow, Eric.","I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door."

He took one look at her and figured it was a scam.,"So, you figure he's not being objective","Man, she is really gullible."
"exasperated House, the Woman had a twitch. She had a seizure.",Both of which Foreman saw?,"Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure."
He just wanted her out the door!,"Whoah, whoah, whoah, back up there, big fella. Foreman's the guy you want to take a swing at.",Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.
frustrated sigh I - just - want her to get some medical attention.,starts to look interested That's not Even close to being true. Something else. Something personal. pauses Give me the file. Looks like this will be fun.,"If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems."
Brain tumor? Foreman enters,"Glad you could join us, Eric. What's the differential for a twitch in the wrist?","Hello? Another medical emergency? Whats wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. Im on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot."
"Yes, you've got that going for you. How could I have doubted your medical opinion?","The big question, you're missing it, all of you. He drops Jane's smelly bag on the table.","Wow. I anticipated wed have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them."

"She can't have an MRI. The CT scan shows she has a surgical pin in her arm, the MRI magnet would have ripped it out of her body. You like the Alien movies? You had no medical history, what were you thinking?","We'll surgically remove the pin, then do the MRI, does that sound good?","Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan."

Didn't we have a conversation about friendship?,"Yeah. I had some follow up questions. I've met your parents, and your brother","You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you."

"looking at the road Look out! Pam slams on the brakes, and the Porsche slides under the trailer of a large truck going through an intersection The car stops on the other side of the road, just in time for a bus to crash into it.",What lie are they telling you? Pharmacist gestures for him to wait.,"The Porsche, Rachel is driving along a highway and Ross has finally moved to the death seat and is terrified."

It's been three weeks,"to Cuddy, who is at the clinic desk Your hospital doesn't have my pain medication.","Its been three and a half minutes, wake up."
The crash didn't cause the bleed.,"Right, the bleed caused the crash.","Aye, he was a bleeder."
"She saw his blood, she got distracted, and she crashed his dad's Porsche.",Dad loved that.,"Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab."
Dad loved that. He was,Don't talk.,That was my dad!

Kid? How old? takes chart,He must have inherited it. He's gonna die. My condolences.,Whats the youngest youve ever had?
This is impossible. A 16-year-old doesn't get hemolytic anemia,"Give her back the file you have bigger pRoblems to tend to, like my meds.",Really unlikely. But I cant say that its impossible.
"Elevated indirect bilirubin, low serum haptoglobin!",He's got meningitis.,"Good news, Raj."

You want us to recheck?,No. If it's environmental he'll get better just from staying here.,Do you want me to check again?
Didn't mean to offend you.,"Okay, so it's infection, lupus, drugs, or cancer.",I never meant to annoy anyone.
"Okay, so it's infection, lupus, drugs, or cancer. Cancer?",Why not? Great meeting. He starts to leave.,"I dont need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?"
Shouldn't we narrow it down before we finish?,My leg gave us 'till 1115.,Why dont we finish the section first.
"My leg gave us 'till 1115. I'll talk to Wilson about lymphoma, to Cameron ANA for lupus, to Chase radioimmunoassay for drugs, to Foreman and you! you test for whatEver you thought it was. He leaves. I've got a date with a pharmacist.","Come on, come on, come on, come on!","Okay, doctor says any minute now."
"You know, there are other ways to Manage pain.","Like what, laughter? Meditation? Got a guy who can fix my third chakra?",Yknow I would its just painful.

You're in denial.,"Right, I nEver had an infarction in my leg, no dead muscle, no nerve damage.",Youre not listening to my side of it.
"It's not just your leg. You wanna get high! You're doing what, 80 mg a day?","Oh, that's way too much! Moderation is the key. Unless there's pain.",Heard about the leg burnin huh?
It's double what you were taking when I hired you.,'Cause you're twice as annoying.,"Yeah, well you didnt know that when you filled out this payroll form."
I can't always be here to protect you. Patients talk. Doctors talk. elevator doors open,"About how big your ass has gotten lately? Not me, I defend it. You got back. They walk into the full elevator.",A number of people in this city want to kill me.
You can't go a week without your drugs.,"No, I don't want to go a week without the drugs, it'll hurt.","Oh sure, every Sunday night Im telling myself Im quitting but every Monday morning its like"
"No, you can't. If you're just getting off pain medication, it will hurt, you won't be having a great time, but you'll make it. If you're detoxing you'll have Parklls, nausea! your pain will magnify five, ten times. You won't make it.","Well, I guess we'll nEver know.",Of course I can.
I'll give you a week off clinic duty if you can go a week off narcotics.,No way! I love the clinic.,"Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a bandaid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half."
You love the pills. Two weeks.,Pills don't make me high. They make me neutral.,Took em one day.
A month. A pause. House reaches into his pocket and pulls out his Vicodin.,"You're on, mister. He throws the pills to Cuddy, who looks positively giddy.",A month. You didnt hear it from me!
Definitely not cancer.,Nothing?,"Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh... I check the jewels every month. This time... You know, its a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So... Whats, um... What you eating?"
"Negative for drugs. ANA was negative, gallium scan was clear!","Yeah, I got that from the nothing. Where's his hematocrit?","Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?"
"Excuse me, someone? Help, please?",as the Ducklings enter the room Polite for a dying kid. He starts to limp off.,"Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?"
How long has it been?,I'm fine.,A year and a half.
We have two hours to figure this out. Either we restore the blood flow or he loses the eye. House walks in from his office. He does not look as earlier.,Forget the eye.,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
ANA was negative. It's not lupus.,This is true. But why are you the one saying it? What are you doing here? I thought we ruled out cancer.,"Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesnt call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?"
I was lonely.,"Well, go see Cuddy. She needs a friend.",I wanted to be alone.
"That's funny, she said you might need one.","That's why you're here? She wants you to keep an eye on me, make sure I don't cheat.",You really think my aunt will pay for me?
"No, I want to make sure you don't start firing shots from the clock tower.",I'm fine.,Or what? You gonna shoot me?
Does your leg hurt?,You Ever been shot?,My leg is killing me.
"There's gonna be side effects. Insomnia, depression, tachycardia",Withdrawal symptoms.,"Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?"
It's not an infection. Gallium scan didn't rEveal anything.,"Okay, what hides from a gallium scan?",The infection has spread too far.
"Right. Clot slips off, travels through the artery, and gets backed up in the eye.","I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What happened?",I just wanna say that Im sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person.
It's an infection. In his heart?,Great.,"He is quite ill, my lord."

Is it my birthday?,"I'm not lonely, my leg hurts.","Cmon, its my birthday."
She's a real masseuse.,"She's five hundred dollars an hour, minimum.","Im telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!"
"She's hot, so she's a hooker? What kind of pathetic logic is that?","The envious, jealous, I-nEver-got-any-in-high-school kind of logic, hello!","Shes a hooker, isnt she."
"She's a legitimate masseuse, come on. looks at her God, she's beautiful.",Because she's beautiful I should do it? What kind of pathetic logic is that?,"As a masseuse and a human, Im begging you, never do that to anyone!"
"The envious, jealous, I'm-married-and-I-can't-do-anything logic! Woman comes over. Hello.","Hi. Listen, I'm, I'm sure you're really good at whatEver it is you do","Heyheyhey, hey thats your wife youre talking about!"
"Dame su Mano. Translation corner means Give me your hand. When House doesn't understand, she grabs it.","Hey, no, let go of my hand.","It is your sisters hand, but the Queens words."
She doesn't speak English. Shhhh!,"Ow! Ow! ah! ah!. oh, my God. Woman looks happy. And if Wilson's looks could take people's clothes off, this show wouldn't be TV-14. Bueno.",Oh. Im too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench.
"So the blindness will be perManent, won't it? Chase nods.",Thank you.,You eyesight will return in time.
Bye. Chase walks up.,I had a massage.,"OK, bye. Alright Meredith,"
Looks like you had a masseuse. Help the pain?,I'm fine.,Would you like something for the pain?
"I know. Kid's echo was normal, no sign of any vegetations on heart valves.",NEver met a diagnostic study I couldn't refute.,Theres no reason to worry.
And the antibiotics aren't doing anything.,"So, double the dosage. 70mg.","Howard, the medicines not working."
That'll box his kidneys for sure!,"Oh, you're right. Save the kidney. The guy we transplant it into will be grateful.",Excellent! Its in a culdesac. We can box him in.
"Also, I have an idea for his eye.",Nothing we can do about his eye.,"Oh, dont anthropomorphize him, hes got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours."
He's got a clot in his retinal,Read the memo.,He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
"If we remove some of the liquid from the eye itself, the Vitreous humor, it might make some extra room around the retinal artery.","If the artery expands, the clot might move out on its own. That's very creative. Why didn't you mention this before?","Well, Im sorry Im not going to an eye doctor!"
"Well, I didn't think of it before.","You should have. As Chase walks away, House leans back against the wall.","Well, I did not know that."
"Help, help help! Dad rushes in.",What's wrong?,"Mother, dont do this please!"
ALT and GDT were in the tank. Our antibiotics,Would not have caused this.,"They, uh, were infected."
I wouldn't do that!,It's not drugs! His liver is shutting down.,No that is the last thing you want to do!
What? What does that mean?,It means he's all better. He's ready to go home.,On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
He's ready to go home. What?,"What do you think it means? You can't live without a liver, he's dying!",Why does he have to go over there?
What is your pRoblem?,"Bum leg, what's yours?",Whats your problem?
His son's dying and you're mocking him?,It was a dumb question.,Are you mocking me?
"No, it wasn't.","You're right, it wasn't.",No it wasnt.
"Exactly! He's detoxing, can't you see he's out of his mind?",walking in That's what they said about Manson.,"What, isnt he sober?"
"Hemolytic anemia doesn't cause liver damage. Add the fact he's coughing blood, you've got three of the indicators of organ-threatening lupus.",It's moving too fast. Could be hepatitis-E.,I have liver damage.
There's only been one case of hep-E originating in the US since --,Its history. Since he's been in and out of the country four times in the last year!,We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment.
You really think he's got hep-E?,No. I think the lupus is way more likely.,Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
All right. Then let's start him on IV Cytoxan and plasmapheresis.,"No, we should rule out hep-E.",He wont take any pills that arent chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.
You just said it wasn't hep-E.,"I said lupus was way more likely, but if we treat for lupus and it is hep-E.","Oh, I was working with Penicillinresistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands."
"I said lupus was way more likely, but if we treat for lupus and it is hep-E. He's toast.",Exactly.,"Fire safety is not a joke, son."
But there isn't a treatment for hepatitis-E. Either he'll get better on his own or he'll continue to deteriorate.,"Yeah, I went to medical school, too. Start him on solumedrol. sp?",Whos the only one who can make him take his medicine when hes sick?
If he's got hep-E that's only going to make him worse!,Not as much.,Well just get him cleaned up a bit.
We'll know it's not hep-E and start treating him for lupus.,Now watch me do it while drinking a glass of water.,You need to contact Holly!
"What do we tell the dad? We think your kid has lupus, so we're gonna treat him for hepatitis-E? And oh yeah, if it really is hep-E, we're not actually giving him hep-E medication, so it's gonna make him worse, not better?",You think he'll go for that?,"Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him."
So you want us to lie?,No. I want you to lie.,Why are you lying to us?
I want you to lie. Why me?,Because he trusts you.,Why would I lie?
looking at x-rays of House's hand I think it's broken. What did you do?,Accidentally closed the car door on it.,Are you sure he didnt break it because it really hurts.
No. Door would have broken the skin. This looks like something hard and smooth smashed it.,I want my Lawyer.,Can I see the wound?
The brain has a gating mechanism for pain. Registers the most sEvere injury and blocks out the others. Did it work?,"Well, my hand hurts like hell. Yeah, I feel much better.",I know how you feel.
"Yeah, I feel much better. Huh.",Don't splint it. I want to be able to bang it against the wall if I need to administer another dose. Just! tape it up. Cuddy walks in.,Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
Why did you tell Cameron to lie to Mr. Foster?,to Wilson Make it tight will ya.,Because I cared enough to lie!
to Wilson Make it tight will ya. Answer me.,"Nothing I could say is going to change how you feel, and nothing could come out of your reaction that is going to change what I plan to do, so","Careful, whoa. First of all, its not like I think thats going to help the Eagles win."
"So, that was you just saying nothing.",Uh-huh.,You never said anything.
The guy is furious.,And scared.,Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
"So, what are you going to do? The father's insisting on the lupus treatment.","Yeah, Cameron told me and I told her to tell him no.","Miss Green, your fathers doctor is on the phone if youd like to speak to him."
"Well, you can't just sit back and let the kid die.",Neither can the father.,"Its no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
So that's your plan? You're gonna play Parkcken with the kid's life?,"Well, he's the dad. I should win easily.","And I got custody of the kid, right?"
Take the week off.,"What, 'cause I lied to a Patient?",Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off.
I told him that you wouldn't treat him for the lupus until,What did he say?,What did he tell you?
That's what I told him.,And that's when he caved.,Thats what he said to me.
Yeah. He agreed to do it your way.,Two plus two equals four.,He said he would do the same for me.
"Hallucinations are a symptom of psychosis, which is the fourth diagnostic criterion. It's official. This is lupus.",Who's Jules? Any mention of her in the medical history?,It is not the only logical explanation.
"It doesn't matter what he's hallucinating about, it matters why! It's lupus!","There's no need to get snippy. This kind of lupus takes years to get to this point, it's been a week.","Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out."
"Yeah, and a 16-year-old kid shouldn't have hemolytic anemia, or be bleeding out of Every orifice, but he is. We had an opportunity to treat this, instead we diddled around with hepatitis-E and now it's too late. He needs a new liver. We screwed up.",You're saying I screwed up.,Shes doing amazing.
You're saying I screwed up. Yes.,Then why didn't you just say that?,"Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake."
You gonna just blame this on her?,Did you agree with my recommendation to treat for hep-E?,"Well, can you blame her?"
And she made herself quite clear.,And then she went and lied to the father. That's why you're angry.,"See, she knew what always meant."
"Yeah, I trusted you.",You always trust me. Big mistake. Lupus is a bad diagnosis.,Thank you for trusting me.
It's the best diagnosis we've got.,That doesn't make it good.,We need to get your friend into the CT machine.
"No, it just makes it this kid's only chance to live. small pause",Put him on the transplant list.,Its better than being dead.
And what happened to your hand?,Got stuck in a drawer.,What happened to your thumb?
"Yeah, right. You're going through withdrawal.","No, I am going through pain. Pain causes nausea.","Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal."
"I took this job to work with you, not cover your ass. He reaches into his pocket and takes out House's Vicodin, which he puts on the desk. Your Vicodin.",And your solution is to give me drugs. It's interesting.,"Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now Im going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night?"
"And hope for someone to die. House walks up, although walk is too jaunty a term. It is evident he didn't take the pills Foreman gave him.",Who's Jules?,House Haigh. They dont have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
"Dr. House, you should get back to your office",Jules. There's no Jules in the history.,"Hold on, Doctor."
It was a hallucination.,Of what?,"Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isnt."
How long can he wait? Not long.,I don't think this is lupus.,He shouldnt make me wait.
"I don't think this is lupus. Come on, let's just go",Your fourth diagnostic criterion of lupus is psychosis this is just a kid missing his cat.,"OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. Ill make sure thats covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?"
He was being attacked by an animal that wasn't in the room. That's psychosis.,There's a difference between psychosis and hallucination.,He was talking madness.
"So, if he was imagining a fake cat it'd be lupus, but since it was a real cat it's not? Take your damn pills.",Psychosis requires,I want to get that image out of my head.
There's no cat! Jules is dead.,"You have a dead family pet, and you nEver mentioned it? Nice family history.","Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead."
"Family history is asking about family members, meaning people related to the Patient. Let's go.",How did the cat die?,My family is the history of heart disease.
"Dr. House, come on, let's go",What happened to the cat?,Howard and his mother are at the hospital.
from the waiting area Old age. She was fifteen years old.,When?,How old was she?
Does this have anything to do with,Where'd she sleep?,This has to do
This is not a cat allergy.,It's not lupus. Where is Jules?,And thats not all Im allergic to.
"Scalpel. He's about to cut, when House enters.",Stop the gases.,Why why why would he need a blade?
"What the hell are you doing, House?",Saving a sixteen-year-old kid from a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs and a very nasty scar. This kid doesn't have lupoid hepatitis. He has acute naphthalene toxicity.,What are we supposed to talk about?
Naphthalene. You're talking about mothballs.,Nope.,"Attention, people of the office."
And your assumption is based on what?,The autopsy I just conducted on his pet cat.,What? Based on what?
Call Cuddy. And security.,You are not removing that kid's liver.,"Call security. Pheebs, didnt you get fired?"
"NOW! Nurse goes to call. House coughs up some phlegm, and spits it on the surgeon. Have you completely lost your mind?!","No, but I have been feeling a little sick lately. Achoo!","No, no. Nurse With Tray doesnt know Joey, she doesnt have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesnt, people die!"
"You've already cost him his liver, don't kill him too!",Why are you so eager to cut into a healthy kid?,I might kill him right now.
Healthy? He's in the toilet!,He just needs some Parkcken soup.,Hes alive! Hes alive!!!
I'm telling Hourani to re-scrub. We're doing this transplant.,"No, you're not.",No! Ive been here for weeks. Im not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why Im doing it.
They've only gotten worse.,If the food here wasn't one step below Riker's Island he would've gotten better. He's lost fourteen pounds.,"If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah."
"Yeah, sure. This is nothing but a dietary thing.","Naphthalene is a gas, a fat soluble gas.",Okay. How about if I eat like this?
"So, getting away from the poison is what poisoned him?","Getting him away from his dad's meatloaf is what's killing him. Cuddy and Keith's dad walk up to House, very quickly.","No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didnt? And poisons not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why dont you ask him?"
"Hey! Take it easy. House touches his lip, which is bleeding.","Your cat did not die of old age. He died of massive internal bleeding and acute liver failure caused by naphthalene poisoning, the exact same thing your son has.","Rachels Office, Joey is knocking on the door holding a hand over a spot on his shirt."
"You lie to me, you mess up my son's surgery, and now you expect me to trust you?","Give me twenty-four hours, we'll pump your son full of calories",Lies come easily to you.
We're doing that surgery.,"getting up slowly If you do the surgery, you'll be killing a mother of four.","Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away."
Father of three.,I was guessing.,Whos the father?
Like you are now?,Naphthalene poisoning is the best explanation we have for what's wrong with your son.,I was once as you are now.
You made it a week.,And won my prize.,You made it.
And won my prize. Congratulations.,Cuddy's a sucker. I would have done it for two weeks off.,"Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?"
"Yeah, it was a piece of cake. You learn anything? They've reached his office door.","Yeah, I'm an addict. He goes into his office. Wilson follows.",They were in his office.
"Wilson follows. Uh, okay.",I'm not stopping.,"Oh, so follow him."
There are programs. Cuddy would give you the time. You could get on a different pain Management regimen,I don't need to stop.,But check that its covered by your health care provider!
You just said!,"I said I was an addict. I didn't say I had a pRoblem. I pay my bills, I make my meals. I function.","Well, well that one has ducks on his tshirt, and this one has clowns."
Is that all you want? You have no relationships.,I don't want any relationships.,"Im single, I dont need this crap."
You alienate people.,I've been alienating people since I was three.,So there are things you dont like.
"Oh, come on! Drop it! You don't think you've changed in the last few years?","Well, of, of course I have. I've, I've gotten older. My hair's gotten thinner. Sometimes I'm bored, sometimes I'm lonely, sometimes I wonder what it all means.","No. No, Ive changed. Like the frog whos put in a pot of water thats heated so gradually he doesnt realize hes boiling to death."
"No, I was there! You are not just a regular guy who's getting older, you've changed! You're miserable, and you're afraid to face yourself",slams his cane down on the shelf Of course I've changed! pause,I think I have you both beat.
And Everything's the leg? Nothing's the pills? They haven't done a thing to you?,"They let me do my job, and they take away my pain. Wilson walks off, looking defeated.",Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
He's got osteopenia. His bones are too thin to fix the arm.,"On cell phone No, price is not a pRoblem if you have what I need. Click",He cant figure out how to fix it.
Click Osteo-,Young Man?,I am clicking.
How did you know?,"Well, if he's an old Man, osteopenia would just be a fact of life, you make him comfortable, send him home, which means you're just boring me.","I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnt for fun."
MRI and PET scan are both negative.,"Well, how old is he? Maybe the osteopenia is just early onset.",Im gonna get a second opinion.
"Pulls out a baseball card Well, let's see. Born 9/21/77.","It's Hank Wiggen? Takes the card and looks at it He signed it, sweet. Reads To Jimmy Wilson, the Cy Young of medicine. You ask for that?","Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 62 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero."
"I-just the Jimmy part. The bone's too thin to support the kind of surgery that would let him pitch again. But if we figure out what's causing the osteopenia, we can rEverse the bone damage, then do the surgery.","Beat the Yankees, and save the free world. Hands the card to Wilson and goes into his office.","Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dogs ear grow back so."
Sorry I'm late. Car broke down on the interstate.,"Checks his watch, then looks back at Foreman skeptically.","Sorry Im late, but I left late."
"Cancer. It first attacks the bones, and then the kidneys.","Come on, people. Pulls out the baseball card He was 17 and 7! His ERA was 2.1.",Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
"You want it to be his kidneys, because if it's his kidneys, then maybe we can treat it, maybe we can fix it. And if it's cancer, then he'll nEver pitch again. If this were a regular guy who came in and broke his arm lifting a box, you would've packed him up and sent him home!","My God, you're right, I lost my head.",Just give me the pitcher.
Chase smirks He weighed 175 his rookie year. Stop.,Now he's 195 after playing a year in Japan. Why?,"Uh, you weighted 200 pounds."
That'd explain the weight gain. And the kidney pRoblems.,And the bone loss.,Perhaps thats why the man is thin.
I was coming in early.,Huh.,Youre here early.
"Claims he has 500 Lawyer jokes, only tells one? Uh!new guy.","You need cash?!Ah, no, I, I don't have that much on me!No no, it's not a pRoblem.","What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?"

"Numbness in my feet and hands, constipation- Cuddy comes over to House",And?,I cant feel my legs.
Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable talking about his private matters-,"Well, neither would I, if I was having trouble controlling my pee pee!","I dunno. I mean, maybe hell talk to you about some of this stuff cause he cant really talk to me about it."
"I can't see!Nah, I'm just screwing with you. House looks pointedly at Cuddy, who smiles It's a hangover, my English Lit prof. told me he'd fail me next time if I didn't show up with a doctor's note.","Well, make friends with the dentist.","Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?"

"He tested negative for steroids. I, um, I have a couple 20s on me. reaches into her pocket",50 of them? Cameron looks shocked Foreman?,On her diet!
"The fat pad biopsy and abdominal CT scan were negative for the cancers, but-","Well, that just leaves us with steroids!",I really dont think the colonoscopy was necessary.
He tested negative for steroids.,Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use.,"Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way."
Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use. But there's one thing they can't hide!checks his watch and walks past Ducklings 1 and 2.,Hi.,Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyones urine.
"pulls the covers back on I am clean, Man, no steroids, no nothing.","Your lips say no, your prunes say yes.",Time to get clean!
"Your lips say no, your prunes say yes. Hypogonadism. Isn't that a great word? Thanks, we don't get to say it nearly enough. To Cameron Start him on Lupron right away. Walks out the door.","These freaks are willing to defile themselves for mass entertainment, for money. I feel sorry for them. Pops a Vicodin. Lola runs after him","Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment."
"He drops a clean urine, denies using steroids, then you're giving him a drug for what, steroid abuse?","!No, no, it's not.","Frame him, for using drugs."
You put him on Lupron.,Uh-huh.,He gave me a pill for it.
"And, you told them it was like milk.",Yes.,Its just milk.
Is there any way in which that is not a lie?,"thinks for a moment It's creAmy. But, I had 3 reasons.","And thats a lie, right?"
"But, I had 3 reasons. Good ones?","Well, we'll see in a minute, I'm just making them up now!He lied to me first.","Hey come on, you havent heard my reason yet."
Your mother did teach you 2 wrongs don't make a right.,"If he lies to me about not taking steroids, then I lie to him about not treating steroids, he's cured. Adds up for me-",It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
Adds up for me- Second reason.,"If I told him the truth, he wouldn't have taken the stuff.","Well, now we have two reasons."
"And if he told you the truth, what would this stuff do to him?",!SEvere respiratory pRoblems.,"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
!SEvere respiratory pRoblems. Third reason.,I wanted to eliminate the placebo effect.,Because I cant breathe.
Excellent! walks over to her desk You and your Lawyer can write a paper.,Which brings me to my fourth reason.,"Okay, you just walked into her office and begin."
I thought you said there were only three. sits down,I thought you'd buy one of them.,"Well, so, areare you sure that there are three?"
I thought you'd buy one of them. Seriously?,He's not gonna sue.,I dont know.
"Because his Lawyer is a nice guy, who realizes it's unfair to blame us for ruining this kid's hundred million-dollar career.","Good guess, but no.",Why are you defending him?
"Good guess, but no. If the Lupron causes respiratory pRoblems, it means he's not on steroids, which means there's something else wrong with him. And the choices, for that something else, are almost universally very bad. Ooh, serious.",Osteopenia messing his bones up.,Will it weaken him?
Shrunken testicles indiCate his body's not putting out enough testosterone.,"glances at Foreman and checks his watch Throw out the lungs, that was the Lupron, my fault. Don't worry, I'll send him a nice note.","Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?"
"What about something environmental? Arsenic, mercury, the symptoms could indiCate-","Pretty small environment. Wife's fine, no one else is sick.","All right, I think I have enough to go on."
"If you throw out the kidneys, Everything else adds up. The testicles, the bones, the impaired liver function, could all be caused by a breakdown of his adrenal glands.","Addison's disease, I like it. Mainly of course, because the treatment is!",Dont forget the male pattern baldness.
rolls her eyes Steroids.,Enough irony for all of us.,She doesnt know she takes them.
"Treatment would cause him to retain fluid. With the kidneys almost shut down already, he'll die.","Well, we'll get him a new kidney. Cameron looks surprised",Lots of people suffer dehydration they all recover just fine.
Your theory is that Addison's is causing all the symptoms except for the kidney pRoblems. What's causing the kidney pRoblems?,"Cameron, if you could make an ironic guess right about now?",What about? Not kidney pie.
Negative for steroids. grins,"Agreed. He's not on steroids now. If he was on them anytime in the last five years, it could've caused the kidney damage.",You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.
"Agreed. He's not on steroids now. If he was on them anytime in the last five years, it could've caused the kidney damage.","You see, kidneys don't wear watches. Sure, gallbladders do, but it doesn't matter, 'cuz kidneys can't tell time. Steroid damage could take years.","No, this is the way he is, the way hes always been."
shakes her head No steroids. How Many times does he have to tell you?,I don't know. How Many times did he lie about cocaine before coming clean with the league?,Shes coming in today and maybe just dont joke around about that stuff in front of her.
That is completely different.,"Oh, that's right, I remember. You nEver did come clean. The league was out to get you, they faked the blood tests, you had to get yourself a Lawyer-","Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff."

Get another explanation.,Okay. Yeah. Think I've got one in my other pants. starts to leave,"Give it up, dude, youre arguing with a crazy person."
"Hold on. House turns around Five years ago, Bangor, Maine. My pitParkng coach had me on something, I nEver knew what it was.",And you nEver tried too hard to find out either.,It belonged to my mother and her mother before her.
How you doin' Doc?,"Good. Very good, yeah.","Hey, how you doin?"
You want me to put Hank Wiggen on the transplant list.,He needs a new kidney. I was thinking the kidney people might have some.,"Hank? No, I dont need Hank Michael."
"Well, they like to save them for people who have-how do I put this- kidney pRoblems.","He's a professional ballplayer, brings joy to millions.","Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! Whatwhat if I was the president?!"
"That's a great idea, we can be the hospital that killed two people. The guy who deserved the kidney, and the ballplayer we bumped up the list when we weren't Even sure what was wrong with him.",Everything else is related to the Addison's.,"What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy."
The test for Addison's was inconclusive.,The test for Addison's is always inconclusive.,"We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace."
Why do we do it at all? We should just ask you. tries to take a paper from under House's fist he doesn't budge. She gives him an irritated look.,"You're not putting him on the list. Moves his hand, Cuddy takes paper",This insistence on handholding is preposterous.
Your powers of deduction are breathtaking.,You take a perverse pleasure at turning me down.,Thats the only logical inference.
"It's what I live for. Once in a while, though, try to ruin my day. Ask me something I can say yes to. House leaves","Oh, I'm sorry Doctor, I didn't know you were busy. Want me to come back?","I mean I love spending time with you, yknow I justI hope were moving forward."
Is he on the list?,No. walks over to her,What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
Then I'm giving him one of mine.,!Okay.,Ill give it to him next time I see him.
You're not gonna tell me it's a bad idea? Why give a kidney to someone who might not be able to use it?,"Not my area. That is, howEver, my chair.",Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.
gets up When do we do it? House sits down,"Very noble gesture. My favorite kind-dramatic, yet completely empty. The chances of non-identical twins being a match-","Alright, Ill tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then well call the couch, and well see who it comes to."
Do you live alone?,You writing a book?,"I do not, my mother lives with me."
I made it a question just because it's more polite. You got a big Keep Out sign stapled on your forehead.,"That explains it, I told them to put it on my door.",Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
"Even if real huMan contact is something you don't have or Even want, or need, you should at least be able to see it in other people.",Yeah. Right. True love.

Foreman says we've got a pRoblem with the transplant.,"walks over to the bookshelf and shuffles through it If she terminates the pregnancy, he's not going to let himself die on principle.","Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection."
!Would you give up a baby for someone you love?,turns around and gives her a piercing look Please tell me I don't have to decide.,Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?

What do the nodules tell us? Sarcoidosis.,"Excellent. Send an ACE lEvel. If it comes back positive, put him on methotrexate.",Thats not the kind of king I want to be.
"Call the Lancet, because that's one bizarre allergic reaction.","Come on, there's no reason you both can't be wrong. It's not allergy, but it's not coincidence, either. Disease number one set off disease number two.",Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I cant wait until I get a rash.
Anthrax weakened his immune system.,And triggered a dorMant sarcoidosis. Keep him on antibiotics for the anthrax and start him on methotrexate for the sarcoidosis.,"One minute he was fine, and then Burned right through him, whatever it was."
Fine. He leaves.,Better go with him. Make sure he doesn't snap and hurt somebody. Foreman follows him.,"If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself."
You're being funny?,Apparently not.,Are you funny?
You know why I give money to this hospital? It's the only way to get attention. You see this? He holds up his wrist.,"Is this a magic trick? Because I am a total David Copperfield fan, although that Tornado of Fire, that seemed a little fake","Listen, Scott... were losing money, okay? Its not a charity its a business. And its a dying business."
"Pain in the wrist. Won't go away for months. House pops a Vicodin. Six doctors' brilliant conclusion is to take it easy. I write a check, name goes on a plaque, and forty-eight hours later I've got two MRIs, a bone scan, and a diagnosis carpal tunnel. I'm in surgery that afternoon.","Fascinating story. You thought of adapting it for the stage? His beeper beeps, he goes to get it in his office.","Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, dont operate heavy machinery."
"I love my look at me! love my son, love him more than anything else in the world, and you're going to start paying attention to this case, or I'm going to make things miserable for",Go back to your son's room.,Love to love ya baby!
I'm not leaving here until you get your ass in gear,"There's a pRoblem. Jeffrey walks out, and..",I am not leaving until Im done.
"Uh, he has clinic duty this morning.","No, he doesn't. I rescheduled you guys so you'd be free.",Dont you know his schedule?
Keep going. House enters.,You page me?,May I enter the room?
"No, I don't need you.","Oh, come on.",I dont know why you cant admit that you need me.
"Gabe's dad found leishManiasis and filariasis on the internet yesterday. They didn't fit then, but now they kind of do.","Sure, except for the nodules and we're not working out of Calcutta General.","Guys, I dont know how many of you have seen Gabe?"
The only reason you're thinking auto-immune is because you're a rheumatologist! If you were a proctologist you'd think rectal cancer.,Gotta go with Senior. He literally wrote the book on this one.,Got it. So Im assuming nothing venereal. Ill just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and havent quite bounced back.
"And 100 mg. of cytoxan, it treats most auto-immunes.","We'll give it to him now, before the fat starts dripping out his eyeballs.",The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it.
Hey! My fingers are numb!,"Your watch is on too tight. Well, how about that! Patient crisis solved.","I cant feel my fingers, hurry up."
You're messing with my head.,Your relationship with your dad is messing with your ability to do your job.,You were trying to blow up my head.
Only because you made my dad part of my job.,"Good point. Haven't seen him in years, he flies across the Atlantic to see you",Of course. Ill always be your dad.
"Haven't seen him in years, he flies across the Atlantic to see you Pacific.",You breeze by him like he's a Hare Krishna at the airport. You don't Even ask why he's in town.,"Uh, no... no. I couldnt find him. Im just gonna talk to him on the plane."
on the stairs It's pRobably a conference.,PRobably.,We are in a stairwell.
How would you feel if I interfered in your personal life?,I'd hate it. That's why I clEverly have no personal life.,Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
I'm going to biopsy his skin lesions.,Good thinking! Prove your dad wrong. That'll solve Everything.,"Oh, Im gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers."
I've got to talk to House about this treatment.,But the Patient's getting better.,Dr. Burke will see you know.
In spite of the cytoxan.,"On the other hand, getting better.","Wow, those pills really worked, huh?"
Cytoxan makes him more susceptible to infection. The anthrax could relapse and be more resistant.,Better!,You got to stop with the antacids.
"You want a negative test for Every auto-immune disease known to Man? Fine, I'll get them!",Be home by midnight or he can't have the car this weekend. Chase stops by the door. You guys talk? Did he tell you why he's here?,"Look, I dont wanna do this test either, but I really do think its a good idea!"
The SLE conference.,Going back to the conference?,This conference is kind of a big thing.
Afternoon panel. I hope I can stay awake.,I hope you can get in.,You can always watch the panels online.
"Lungs, stage four.",You look good.,I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
"I'm not. Came to the States to go to Sloan-Kettering, and to see Dr. Wilson.",What'd he say?,"Uh, yeah, Im a resident at Huntington Hospital."
What'd he say? Three months.,But you haven't told Robert. You don't want to burden him because you were such a lousy dad.,A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
I'd prefer you not tell him.,"Yeah, it's better. I'll get to see his face when he reads his dad's obituary.",Well maybe you dont have to tell him anything.
It's not your business.,I suppose it isn't.,Its none of your business.
"If we don't stop the nerve deterioration quickly, he'll be paralyzed for life.","Well, luckily, at this rate, that should only last about a week. Okay, so",He can die just fine on his own.
Robert was right. You said multiple neurofibromatosis.,"Are you saying that for the chance of a beautiful family moment, or is there some medicine involved?","Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder."
"Are you saying that for the chance of a beautiful family moment, or is there some medicine involved? Fits better.",Too bad. I was hoping for the other reason. I was gonna go get my camera. Get a CT scan. His brain this time.,"For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drugaddled first cousin, which Im assuming is embarrassing, yes?"
One's always been more than enough for me. House taps him on the shoulder with his cane.,Why didn't you tell me that Rowan Chase was in to see you?,"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm."
"to the blonde Excuse me. to House Ethics, confidentiality? Does any of this ring a bell?",You could have covered yourself. Called me in for a consult.,"What about nonsafety issues, in terms of liability?"
It is a juicy piece of gossip. You know what happened? I got all focused on his cancer and lost perspective.,"You can't tell Chase, but I can. What should I do?","Its just... Im sorry... Its gossip, and I dont think its healthy."
Oh! This is where I give you advice and pretend you're going to listen to it. I like this part. Did Rowan ask you not to tell?,"I promised I wouldn't. My fingers were crossed, though, so I'm wide open.","OK, youve got to promise that youll never, ever tell Ross that I told you."
I was wrong! This is the musing-out-loud part! Do I actually need to be here?,"Telling him, now that's got real entertainment value.",Im sorry. Do I still need to be here?
"Hmmm, he might Even cry. On the other hand, there is the do unto others thingy.",Then I should definitely tell him! I'd want to know.,"You know I think he will be surprised, till he realizes hes a monkey, and uh, you know, isnt capable of that emotion."
You want to know Everything. There's also the keeping your promises thingy.,"Oh, you nEver run out of thingies. Like that blonde thing you were chatting up.","Yeah, and Im not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship."
She's the hospital accountant! We were going over billing procedures!,"Double-entry bookkeeping? Elevator dings, because the elevator wins at comic timing.","Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting."
What are you going to do?,"Billing procedures. They're so compliCated, aren't they? Wilson rolls his eyes as the doors close.","For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, dont you think?"
"No masses, no fibrous tangles, nothing. It's not neurofibromatosis.","Drs. Chase are 0 3. Even when they agree they're wrong. So, next. What else could cause neural damage as well as all the nodules?","Yeah I mean its probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there."
"Doesn't matter. His lesions are in the wrong place, his feet are the one clear spot.",Kid's dad mentioned leishManiasis.,"Well, you dont have all the information."
"Yeah, and filariasis, but the throat nodules still don't fit with that.",Two diseases pretty much exclusive to Southeast Asia. What if the anthrax didn't set off the second disease?,"The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about his first night with Carol."
We're back at coincidence again?,No. What if something else was the trigger?,Couldnt it just be a coincidence?
Nothing else happened.,We happened.,What do you mean?
"We've been through this, it's not an allergy.",I've gotta pee. He leaves.,Wh?! What about my allergies?!
What did the CT scan tell you?,Nothing. He grabs Jeffrey's bad wrist.,My last physical.
He grabs Jeffrey's bad wrist. Ow!,"On a scale of one to ten, how painful?",The way he just cuts off his arm.
About half as painful as when I punch you in the face.,Don't do that. It'll hurt you. Carpal tunnel surgery obviously didn't work.,How would you like a mean cold slap?
Who are you?,The little ones call me Uncle Gregg. Your dad nEver had carpal tunnel. You mentioned two obscure diseases to Dr. Chase. How'd you know about them?,When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind.
I read about them on the internet.,"So, what'd you search for? Diseases from Asia that don't match my son's symptoms? You heard about them in Asia.","Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them."
I've nEver been there.,"Well, you pRobably just forgot. Let me refresh your memory. Some remote, dusty village, close quarters, at least a year! starting to come back?","Yeah, Ive been to these places before, but Ive never really seen them, you know."
"Excuse me, what does this have to do with our son?","to Gabe Your dad's pissed off. He should be. Comes here, expecting us to do an extra good job because he gives a whole lot of money to this hospital",My apologies. Ive been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
yelling Don't talk to my son like that!,"Just telling him my job, my obligation to this","Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop."
Stop! What's going on?,"There's only one thing that you guys have got to do. Tell the truth, or your son will die. How long were you in Asia?","Ohwhoaoh! Oh! Okay. Grade A gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why."
What does this have to do with my son? But House has left.,"Clue number one If I were Jesus, curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine.",So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
"Clue number one If I were Jesus, curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine. Demonic possession?","Close, but no wafer. Clue number two Rheumatology Rowan was almost right. It causes auto-immune symptoms.","Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good."
"Yeah, that's real big in the Jersey suburbs.","It's leprosy. Run a FITE stain, it'll be positive. Daddy hung out on the wrong kind of Indian ashram.","I, I know its big, I just didnt know it was uh, haha big."
"But it's obviously dorMant in the dad, how could the kid catch it?","It's not dorMant in the dad, it's just slow. Damaged his ulnar nerve, was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel. NEver trust doctors. Run a FITE stain.","News flash If you didnt carry it around for nine months, it isnt your kid."
No wonder he got anthrax. The leprosy weakened his immune system.,"Vicious circle. The leprosy made him vulnerable to the anthrax, and the anthrax treatment put the leprosy in overdrive.",And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
"But the antibiotics we gave him, they cure leprosy.","Yeah, that's where the trouble starts.",It runs on syphilis?
So the cure's killing him!,"to Cameron I want you to call down to Carville, Louisiana, home of the last leper colony in the lower 48. Get them to send up some thalidomide.","More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying Oh no."
Get them to send up some thalidomide. Thalidomide?,"Twelve-year-olds don't have sex, right? So he can't be pregnant. Make the call. to Rowan I need to speak to your boy. Chase is alone in the office with House.","They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills."
Why does Everybody need to know my business?,"People like talking about people. Makes us feel superior. Makes us feel in control. And sometimes, for some people, knowing some things makes them care. He takes some Vicodin.",Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. Whats the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
"I'd tell you my dad left, my mum drank herself to death! you gonna care about me more?","Cameron would. Me, I just like knowing stuff. pause I know you hate your dad, but I'm gonna tell you something","Yknow what? I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later. Goodbye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. Sheshe thinks that youre just using me."
"I don't hate him. I loved him until I figured out that it hurts a lot less to just not care. You don't expect him to turn up to your football match? No disappointments. You don't expect a call on your birthday, don't expect to see him for months? No disappointments. You want us to go make up? Sink a few beers together, nice family hug? I've given him enough hugs. He's given me enough disappointments.",Okay.,I dont hate you.
Okay. That's it?,That's it. Chase leaves.,"Okay, thats it."
I need a doctor. I can't move my leg!,"32-year-old female, paralysis and sEvere pain in her right quad. Go.",I cant feel my toes.
How'd she get to you?,She's the CEO of Sonyo Cosmetics. Three assistants and fifteen VPs checked out who should be treating her. Who da Man? I da Man. I always suspected.,"Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine."
"Dr. House, I beliEve that they're right, and",Stop talking.,"Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr."
Stop talking. What?,"You read one of those negotiating books, didn't you?","Oh, my God, stop talking."
"Dr. House, are you saying that she doesn't have a clot or are you saying that if she does have a clot she doesn't need blood thinners and an angiogram?","Chase, put her on blood thinners, do an angiogram. Cameron looks triumphant. When that comes back negative, MRI the spine. If that's clean, cut her open and biopsy the leg.","Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that."
"If that's clean, cut her open and biopsy the leg. Excellent suggestion.","Read less, more TV.",We gotta get her to a vet right now.
Hmm. He walks off.,Say ah.,He just left.
Say ah. Ah.,"No, really belt it out, like you're gonna throw up.",Say it with an accent!
Ah! He coughs in House's face.,"Perfect. Okay, that's it. We should know in a couple of days what's growing in your son's throat. The dad doesn't say anything in response. Hello?","Commander!Othor gets back on his feet, pulling out Jons sword out of his chest. Outside of the room, Ghost goes beserk, trying to get in."
He can't talk.,Excuse me?,Hes not saying what he needs to say.
He had knee surgery.,Right!,He tore his scrotum dancing.
"About a year ago, and then he couldn't talk.","Right, yeah, well, that happens.","Uh, about two years ago."
"AAH! The dad looks frightened, but doesn't say anything.","Just wanted to see if your dad, uh, sorry. He leaves.",I dont care about your dad!
I need you to wear your lab coat.,I need two days of outrageous sex with someone obscenely younger than you. Like half your age.,"All right, come on, lets go get your coat."
Wear the coat.,Man oh Man. Someone got spanked real good this morning.,I dont know what Im gonna do about this coat.
"Guy gives $100 million to cure cancer, pretty small concession to wear a lab coat.",Cure cancer. Is the hospital getting out of the dull business of treating Patients?,Your lab is funded by some MiddleEastern dilettante?
You know that's not what he's doing.,I know exactly what he's doing. He's using us to run clinical trials.,Hes not a part of this.
"Oh, shame on him! Saving lives like that!","entering his office It's unethical. Cuddy follows. Oh, are you coming in, too? I thought I had you convinced.",He was helping me because I saved his life.
Clinical trials save thousands of lives.,He's using Patients as guinea pigs.,My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
Pharmaceutical companies do that Every day.,"Are we a pharmaceutical company? We're gonna wind up pressuring desperate Patients into choices that are bad for them, good for us. You're gonna compromise Patient care.","Hey, Sheldon, lets go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that."
Who the hell am I talking to? Suddenly ethical lapses are a major concern for you?,What's interesting is it suddenly doesn't bother you.,Thats a big ethical area?
"So, if you ignore ethics to save one person it's admirable, but if you do it to save a thousand you're a bastard. All he's done is taken your game and gone pro.",He's not going to kill a few Patients. He's going to kill this hospital.,So maybe youre not completely ethical after all.
We should introduce ourselves. It couldn't hurt.,getting coffee Make him a bundt cake. Patient hit a ten on the pain scale. What would explain that?,"You know, I just want to address everyone first."
"There was no clot in her leg, the angio was totally clean.",What about the muscle biopsy?,"Shes fine. Shes experiencing BraxtonHicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall."
My Aunt ELisalives in Philiadelphia.,"Oh, it's storytime! Let me get my baba.","Yeah, Im looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?"
"Her normal temperature is 96.2, not 98.6 like you and me. If her temperature were 98.6, she'd have a fEver. I'm just wondering if you think we could apply the same logic to Carly's sed rate.",That's absurd. I love it.,"Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature?"
"If 15 is high for Carly, then she has inflammation.","Which could, in turn, mean cancer. I'll talk to Wilson. Next time, skip Aunt Elisa.",I am not abandoning you.
"You're pRobably talking about a primary bone cancer. Can be tricky to detect, you'll need a bone scan",That's why I'm talking to an oncologist.,You should feel a small nodelike object rolling back and forth along the bone.
"Sure, I've nothing better to do besides departmental meetings and budget reports! new ChairMan of the Board, you know.",Oh! I hadn't heard.,No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
Right. Clinical trials!,Completely unethical.,Not double blind studies.
And a very bad omen for you. There's not much money in curing African sleeping sickness.,"No, I have seen Every scary movie Ever made.","Mmm, Im telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food."
Billionaires buy movie studios to get laid. They buy hospitals to get respect.,And the reason you want respect?,"Yeh, theyre rich."
To! get laid.,Okay then.,To get sex.
"Oh, come on. You know how good you have it here.","Yes, I'm the big poobah, the big cheese, the go-to guy.",Come on. You got this. Here.
"You do the cases you want to do, when you want to do them. You're not going to get that anywhere else.","Relax, I've been through three regime changes in this hospital. Every time, same story.","Well, when youre not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules."
"Just keep your head down, that's all I'm saying. And put on your coat.","It itches. Wilson sighs and leaves. House calls after him. So, are you going to do this bone scan for me or what?",No. Roy? No.
Yes. House throws a Vicodin up in the air and catches it in his mouth.,"Dr. Simpson! Did you hear? New Management. I'm thinking about switParkng to orthopedics. How much do you guys get for massage now, without the happy ending?","Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother."
"Dr. House, what do you want?",You remember a guy named Van Der Meer? Not a big talker. You fixed his ACL.,"What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?"
"Well, not according to my medical malpractice premiums.",Didn't get hypertensive during surgery? No strokes? Maybe some connectivity loss?,"Well, you know your insurance will cover that."
"What, you're going to get involved now?",I'm not involved. Guy brought his son into the clinic.,"Well, I should be involved in that, so why dont you get me up to speed?"
I didn't touch the son. I'm not taking any responsibility there.,The son's fine. Can't shut him up. The dad show any signs of cortical disease? Wernicke's?,Id never do that to the father of my son.
"No. Nothing. And that's why we settled because we couldn't find anything. The guy got over a million dollars, don't tell me he's complaining.",He's not saying boo.,Was there anything valuable in the car?
"There is another way. We could do a virtual colonoscopy. Basically, we do a CT scan of your colon. It's non-invasive, but it's very expensive. I assume that's not a pRoblem. Carly looks at him. Say yes.",Mr.,Thats actually not a bad plan.
Virtual colonoscopy was clean. No colon cancer.,What happened to a regular old-fashioned colonoscopy?,My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
She was uncomfortable doing any more tests! I had to convince her to do that one!,Do you get that often? Women would rather die than get naked with you?,"When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure."
Women would rather die than get naked with you? She's scared.,But not of tests. Just embarrassing ones.,"What, are you afraid of a dead whore?"
Just embarrassing ones. Yeah.,"It's not an inflammatory process, it's not a clot because Chase's angio says so, and it's not cancer because her toosh is perfect.","Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that Ive been embarrassed by."
Maybe it's worth looking into,I thought you said Carly's angio was clean.,Might be something to think about.
It was clean. House puts the scans up on his light board.,You guys see the pRoblem here? Foreman gets up to get a closer look.,How could I have left them in the copy room?
"There's no indication of any abnormalities. No lesions, no spurs, no masses",Her toes are screwed up. They're backwards. Do you guys know how much surgery it's going to take to swap them back?,How come we cant think of something we both want to do?
What are you talking about?,Either she literally has two left feet or you angio-ed the wrong leg.,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi."
gets up to look That's impossible. It can't be the wrong,Or maybe it was Jenny! How come some resident signed this radiology form? Were you Even in the room?,"If its not a right angle, it is a wrong angle."
I'll redo her angio straight away,"You'll do nothing! Foreman, you do the angiogram. Foreman leaves.",Ill come back for her later.
"Foreman did a thoracentesis to drain the fluid from her lungs. They sent the fluid to the lab, it'll be back in a few hours. You'll be happy to know that Chase's mistake didn't cost her. Angio rEvealed no clot.",I'm thrilled.,"Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours."
"Okay, see, now you're just being stubborn. It's cold, perfectly good excuse to wear your lab coat.",Carly needs a heart transplant.,"Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm."
Thoracentesis rEvealed a transudate?,Haven't gotten it back yet.,I dont want to talk about it.
"Her MUGA scan, what was the ejection fracture? Maybe you could treat it, surgically.",Haven't done the MUGA.,I dont know.
How do you know she needs a heart transplant?,I got my aura read today. It said someone close to me had a broken heart.,How do you know exactly what shes going through?
Since when do I need the secret pass code to talk to you?,I can't tell you anything. Professional responsibility.,Not until I finish what I started.
Like that matters to you.,"Not my professional responsibility, yours. New regime, you gotta keep your head down, too.",That doesnt matter to me at all.
"Now, that's good thinking, because I was going to go right to Cuddy and rat you out as soon as you were done talking.","I'm not saying you want to, I'm saying you'd be obligated to.","But Penny, this was your idea."
"Because of my position on the Board? House looks at him. Because of my position on the transplant committee? House says nothing. Hey, you brought this up for a reason. You need to talk to me.",I can't.,You left us no choice.
You sure you're doing the right thing?,I've come up with a few really great rationalizations. Chase and Cameron walk up.,"Yeah. Were doing the right thing, right?"
"Thoracentesis rEvealed a transudate. Wilson looks, well, amazed. We did an echo. She's in sEvere congestive heart failure. She needs a heart transplant. We'll get her on the list immediately",She's already on the list.,"Rifts. Yeah, I know."
You're Dr. House. I found a picture of you online at a conference,You need a heart transplant.,I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper.
"I run, I work out, I","You cut yourself. PRobably highly ritualized. You play the same Sarah MacLaughlin song over and over while you do it, pRobably works better than anti-depressants.","Yeah. Hey, heres an idea, why dont we use our wedding china today?"
I don't understand how that has to,You're a high-powered bulimic.,"Because, uhit has to."
Three times a week.,"In about an hour, there's going to be an emergency meeting of the transplant committee to discuss where you fall on the list should a new heart become available.",Lets see if he needs help.
So you're here to tell me I have just a few hours to live?,Unless I lie to the committee.,You all plan to die here tonight?
Why are you here doing this to me? What do you want?,I want to know what's right.,Come here. Now what do you want with this?
"Am I worth it? You think I'm pathetic. Has a good job, Everything in the world, but she just doesn't like the way that she looks","Oh, stop hiding! Carly looks taken aback at his yelling. I'm asking you if you want to live or die, you can't Even say that!","Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, shes needy, shes vulnerable. Im thinkin, chaching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. Youre doin this."
What do you want me to do? Cry?,Yes!,Do you want me to cry?
crying I don't want to die. I don't.,This 32-year-old female was admitted by my staff because of paralysis and pain in her right thigh.,I always thought having a heart attack was natures way of telling you to die!
"Uh, Dr. House, I'm confused by your time and date stamps. It appears that you put Carly on the transplant list before you did these tests.",I had a hunch.,"Yeahyeah, help me out here, when you come out of the brain transplant, you are going to be her?"
You don't have hunches. You know.,"Look, if the tests had come back differently, obviously I would have taken her off the lists, but on the long shot!",You guess? You dont seem to have much of a handle on this.
Is there any exclusion criteria we should know about?,CAT scan rEvealed no tumors and Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.,And what special circumstances are those?
What about any other criteria?,No atherosclerotic vascular disease,There are lots of considerations.
Are there any,"No pneumonia, no bacteriemia, no Hep-B or C or any other letters.","I would be honored, Your Grace."
Substance abuse? Any history of,"No alcohol, no drugs.",Do you think its possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
"Any psyParkatric conditions, history of depression","She's a little blue, but turns out she needs a heart transplant. Cuddy glances at Vogler, who gives her a pointed look.","Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby."
"Dr. House, if you subvert or mislead this committee, you will be subject to disciplinary action. pause","Dr. Cuddy, do you have any reason to think that I would lie?","Ok, Michael, Im dissolving this committee."
I simply want you to answer the question! Is there anything on the recipient exclusion criteria that would disqualify your Patient from getting a heart?,looks at Wilson and Vogler before answering No.,I dont think so.
looks at Wilson and Vogler before answering No.,Beautiful organ donor weather.,Dont just say yes!
"in his best hands-on-hips confrontation voice You lied, didn't you?",I nEver lie.,"Yes, well, he lied."
I nEver lie. Big mistake.,Then you should have voted against putting her on the list.,"Well, it was an accident."
You're my friend.,"Oh, jeez. Have some backbone. If you think I'm wrong, do something.",Youre the best friend I ever had.
"Wait, you're getting mad at me for sticking up for you?",You value our friendship more than your ethical responsibilities.,"No. You know what? Maybe thats what this whole things about. Youre not mad at me, youre mad at yourself."
Our friendship is an ethical responsibility. House's beeper beeps. What is it?,My Patient's getting a heart.,"Oh, its my new beeper."
They just stopped Carly's heart. And your dumb Patient,"They're all oh, the guy who can't talk.","OK, you know what?"
"Mr. Van Der Meer, he scheduled an appointment to see you.","Oooh, goody.","Oh, do you have an appointment?"
I wanted you to know Chase is worried you're going to fire him.,"It's bad enough that screw-ups cost lives. Now we've got Vogler, screw-ups cost jobs. I want Chase scared. I want him doing Everything he can to protect his job.","Michael, if you hadnt told us this, then we wouldve thought that you were actually firing him."
"Dr. House, if you were in his position wouldn't you be more likely to perform well if you were reassured and","Oh, will you stop it with the book! Why are you doing this?","Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance."
I'm not doing anything.,You're Manipulating Everyone.,Wait a minute!
"People! dismiss me. Because I'm a Woman, because I'm pretty, because I'm not aggressive. My opinions shouldn't be rejected just because people don't like me.",They like you. Everyone likes you. He starts to walk away.,Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class.
Do you? dramatic pause. House stares at Cameron blankly. I have to know.,No.,Amy! pause Yes I do.. I really do. grabs Ross hand for support
quietly Okay. She walks away.,"looking at his watch 5 hours, 23 minutes, that's fast.","Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call."
Is that good or bad?,"It depends. Either surgery went really well, or it ended really abruptly.","Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa."
Textbook. She'll outlive us all.,Thank you.,"Yeah, I cant wait to see the look on her face when I die young."
She'll outlive us all. Thank you.,"So, sing for me.",Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
"So, sing for me. Dad looks at House, and then grabs his laptop. Oh, no, no, no, no! come on, look. When you had your surgery, you were intubated. Surgeon stuck a tube down your throat. Now, it nEver happens, and it's nEver caught, but it happens. Your vocal chords were paralyzed. I treated the spastic dysphonia with Botox. Ironically, a substance that tightens Every other corner of your face actually loosens the tongue. I have healed you. You can talk. Dad shakes his head. Oh, well. House goes to leave, and as he does! BOOOO! Dad grasps his laptop in fear, but no scream. Okay, you don't have to say anything, it can be our little secret. If you can talk, blink twice. Dad stares at House. But you're not going to, because you think you won't be entitled to the money you won in the settlement with Simpson. Yesterday I would have said you'd have to give the money back. Today! hospital's come into a lot of money, mum's the word. Dad blinks twice, and House smiles. Dad smiles back, and all is cheery in Exam Room one.",Hey.,"Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, Ive heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well Im working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great...

Hey. Hey.,"I know the cardiologist has given you some guidelines, schedule of medications, and a strict diet just what someone with an eating disorder needs.",Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
Fried Parkcken from the Carnegie Deli. You're kidding.,"Yeah. Actually, I got it downstairs. Carly laughs a bit.","Hohoho, fried stuff with cheese!"
"Why did you fight for me? You risked so much, and you hardly know me.","You're my Patient. Don't screw it up. Carly nods, and House leaves.","I fought for you, didnt I?"
"You're my Patient. Don't screw it up. Carly nods, and House leaves.","over the music Love this part! switches to air drums, and! Vogler turns off his music Okay. He ruined it.","Thank you all for your concern, but Im gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?"
"Just wanted to stop by and introduce myself. I'm Vogler, new ChairMan of the Board. In a way, I guess that makes me your boss.",I am sorry about the lab coat thing. The dry cleaners destroyed it. Vogler laughs and sits.,"Hey boss, I didnt know you were coming in today."
"That was my very first heart transplant meeting, very exciting.","Trust me. Six Flags, way more exciting.","Oh, right! Your adoption interview!"
Patient's very lucky to have such a passionate doctor who stands up for what he beliEves in.,Sweet of you to say.,"Why? Why? I know its a little weird, but hey, hes a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. Ah look, its my favorite patient!"
"Yeah. 'Fraid you've been duped, though. He pulls out the bottle of ipecac from his pocket. The nurse found this in the Patient's purse. pause","Oh, my. If only I'd known.",Oh my God!
Tough being a doctor. You've got all that power. The power to play God.,"Yes, I don't envy the transplant committee their responsibility. They basically would have been forced to kill that poor girl. I'm not sure I could have done that.","The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family."
"This is not a game to me, Dr. House.",No.,"Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?"
I've got Cuddy. Right.,And Wilson.,"Okay. Okay, thats him! Thats him! Thats Cujo! Thats Cujo!"
We're in a meeting.,Need the Lawyer.,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting."
Who'd you kill?,"Nobody, but it's not Even lunch.",Why did you kill him?
What? They want you to examine a sick person? This is a public relations nightmare. Don't think our staff do that kind of thing around here! this place would be crawling with sick people!,"I'm a doctor, I'm not a lapdog for the feds I don't play fetch.","Yeah, ok. Im sure that doctors office cant be worst than on a class trip to the Hersheys factory!"
"You have three choices hire a Lawyer to fight the order, treat the guy, or go to jail for contempt. Up to you.","grabs the papers back Jail. You'd like that. No more naughty schoolgirl. to Vogler Conjugal visit, that's her new fantasy. Vogler tries not to laugh as House leaves.","Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him."
We're not leaving until he's gone or you show me one good reason for keeping him.,"He's really out of it, huh?",Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
looking at the file He had his stomach pumped! Why would they do that?,Rule out poisoning.,I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch.
Huh. Not the typical first guess.,"No, the first guess was faking it. Patient's a federal witness, reluctant, I'm assuming. He's also an 8 on the Glasgow coma scale.",If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
"Any recent history of head trauma? Bad car accident, fall?","They tell me no, but do an MRI to be sure. They round the corner to Diagnostics, Bill is standing by the door.",Im sorry. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
"Metabolic causes. Liver, kidney, diabetes","Check for Everything, feds are paying. We're gonna turn a profit on this one, boys.",Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
"Dr. House, Bill Arnello. He shakes House's hand. I'm a Lawyer, I represent Mr. Smith. What's wrong with him?",Do I come to you with my pRoblems?,"Hey, Leonard. Whats going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?"
He's also my brother.,"What, you changed your name? Smith wasn't good enough for you?",And hes a great brother!
"His name's Joey, he's my only brother.","He's important to you, got it.",Whos your brother?
"I want you to do your job. Diagnose him, fix him, and keep him here.",We're a bit of a specialized hospital. We generally only deal with Patients when they're actually sick.,"Hey, Pam, Im assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him."
"If you release my brother to the government, and he does what they want, Even if you fix him, he's dead. I need time to convince him of that. He shuts off the stop. Good news is, if you screw up you don't have to worry about a malpractice suit. If he's dead, one by one, I'll take away the things you love 'till there's nothing left. Elevator opens, House leaves.","So, on the Mafia thing, that's a yes.","And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested."
Bleeding around his brain caused pressure inside his head which caused the coma.,looking at the scan These look like pseudomembranes. Those take time to form. If it was an old injury it wouldn't have caused the coma.,"Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died."
"Subdural hematoma placed where this one is, it could have caused his coma.",What about his liver?,"Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned Me and my Girlfriend?"
"I say we evacuate the cavity, see if he wakes up.","The neurologist thinks it's his brain, wants to open up his head. Frankly, I'm shocked! You get to use the big boy drill and Daddy's big red toolbox.",Ow. I dont want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
"He's okay now, he can leave.",I'm not releasing him.,Is he okay?
Because the brother doesn't want you to?,"Or because he had an unexplained coma, which sounds better?",Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?
The hematoma caused the coma.,"That's a catchy diagnosis, you could dance to that.","Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died."
"I think Chase is right. It still should be evacuated, but it's not an immediate threat.",Cameron's my girl.,Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
I'd release him.,Are you disagreeing with me because,Absolutely. And Id leave him there.
I'm disagreeing because that's my medical opinion.,Of course it is.,I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
"Of course it is. But unless I've been named as the fourth part of the Axis of Evil, invaded and occupied, this is still not a democracy. He's staying. Send for Hepatitis serologies and an autoimmune panel. He enters the clinic.","Hey. I'm with you. Old enough to drink, old enough to do something really stupid and make yourself a baby.","No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that."
He's my brother. I'm watParkng him while my parents are in Barbados. He's having trouble breathing and there's a lot of wheezing.,"listing to the kid's breathing with his stethoscope Whistling, technically. Upper airways, nose.","Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. Whats going on with your brother?"
"If he's got the croup, that could become meningitis, right?",Absolutely. He leans over the kid.,Is it? Oh. Its like his sinuses are right here in the car.
I was just studying and all of a sudden I hear him crying and sounding all weird. My parents are going to kill me. House reaches into the kid's nose with tweezers.,I doubt it.,"Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him."
You don't know them.,"No, I doubt you were studying while your parents were away.",Never even heard of these people.
"No, I doubt you were studying while your parents were away. He retriEves a tiny toy policeMan from the kid's nose. Hello, Officer. You might want to rinse this off before you let him play with it again. His beeper beeps.",What happened? Where is he?,You are such a tattletale!
"Vogler called admitting, admitting called Justice, Justice came and took him away.",And who called Vogler? All the ducklings look at each other.,"well, the good news is no more guilty conscience."
D-D-D-D-Dr. House in the House! Impeccable timing as always.,You had no authority to release my Patient.,We got the house.
"Dr. House, from what I understand, your",From what you understand? He's not your Patient how the hell do you understand anything?,"In the bedrooms of tenyearold girls, where they belong."
He's not your Patient how the hell do you understand anything? That's sad.,You're not Even a doctor.,"No, he doesnt understand."
John Smith is here only because of court order. I had the records faxed to the Judge she rescinded the order.,"Why bother, just to piss me off?","Well, youll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and hes willing to sign the court papers."
Keeping the government off our ass. Hmm. Yeah. House's beeper beeps. That makes no sense for a public institution.,Okay. turns to leave,Protecting the people.
turns to leave Okay what?,"Okay, sir. Carry on. He leaves.","Okay, I dont think we can turn anymore!"
"35-year-old male, vital signs are stable now. Gave him 2 liters en route. Just released from here two hours ago. Cuddy and Vogler walk up.","So, your junior G-Man badge isn't looking so good.",Any news on your coworker whos in the hospital?
His liver's worse.,Comatose?,He looks worse.
Serology tests came back positive for Hep-C.,Hep-C is a chronic condition. You don't think this is an acute situation?,I was in the hospital room with her.
"Coma, vomiting, abdominal pain, Hep-C explains Everything.",Except for the suddenness of the onset.,Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
What's wrong with the timing?,You get home one night.,We waited too long!
"He also has high estrogen lEvels in his blood. That's indicative of a chronic condition, not acute.",One test. What do his other liver tests tell us?,Perhaps hes at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
Uh-huh. And why is her test better than mine?,Because she's cuter. Cameron looks uncomfortable. Though it's close. Do a liver biopsy. When the results come back we'll know what we're looking at.,"Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?"
"Why wait to treat the Hep-C? If I'm right, Joey gets better that much faster.","Right. Then he gets to testify, and you get a gold star from Cuddy.","You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home."
Then what's the downside? Or is that the downside.,Do I have a reason for not wanting you to get any stars?,"Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits."
You're off the case. What? Why?,Somebody told Vogler that I lied to the transplant committee.,Go get back on that case honey!
You think I did?,You're too careful. You wouldn't jump ship unless you knew what was in the water.,Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?
"Stop, you're embarrassing me.",But I want Vogler to think I think it's you.,"Oh, no. Um, I, Im embarrassed. Its stupid."
"Ah, this is all my fault.",Took another homework break with Betty Lou?,Ow. That was your fault.
"No, last week I showed him a magic trick.",Pulled a quarter out of his nose. It's a classic.,I showed him some card tricks.
Bill enters. Dr. House.,Got a crisis here!,"Room 816, Dr."
"to kid Stop! Kid shuts up, allowing House to pull a firefighter out of his nose.",It's a neat trick.,yells Come on!
You have to beliEve you'll actually hurt them.,Ah.,There are people who want to hurt me.
Your people insulted my brother.,"What, they put roMano in the parmesan cheese shaker again?","My dear brother, you wound me."
Said he was a crackhead or a homo or something.,Those idiots.,He was being a jerk to everyone.
"There were rumors, but Joey nEver said anything about!. If people find out he's being treated for Hep-C? Feds get that chart, someone says something to somebody, word'll get out. And then Joey's Manhood, his rep is destroyed.",You're worried about how his coworkers will react in the Walmart in Des Moines.,"Well Joey doesnt like to talk about it but, hes one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives."
"He's not going into Witness Protection, I won't let that happen.","Listen, I don't know if you know about this, but mob businesses sometimes keep two sets of books.",This witness wont return my calls so were gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
"One legit, one not.",Exactly.,Were both frauds.
You jerking my chain?,"Doctors are busy, sometimes they forget to write things down, it happens all the time.","No, dont worry, the chain is off."
"Thanks. He turns to leave. Oh, and whatEver you're not giving him for whatEver he doesn't have, is that going to fix him?",I doubt it.,"If you want to help him, leave him be."
I doubt it.,On your way to polish Vogler's car?,Hmm. Doubt it.
"Gone are the days of the grumpy old doc seeing Patients in the basement of his House, getting paid a few Parkckens.",How will I eat?,A real doctor?
"You know what Cuddy has been locked in with Vogler about all day today, and yesterday?",Floor polish costs through the roof?,"Okay, whoawhoa easy there Melissa!"
You. Her secretary's been to the photocopier all day with your records. It's all they're looking at in there. House looks shocked.,"My car has been stolen. They look around for it, and see!",Monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whats in it.
Or rein-CAR-nated. !a 1965 red Corvette in House's Parking space. Wilson picks up a piece of paper stuck in the windshield wiper. Pink slip. A gift from the Arnello brothers.,"smiling You know, they're gangsters, sure, but they're thoughtful, too.",Whos running the red Corvette?
You can't keep it. It's graft.,"No, no, no, no.",I can keep it?
So there's nothing wrong with this. Right.,"Damn. '65. Perfectly restored. What do you think a guy like Joey would do if someone turned down a gift? That's kind of an insult, isn't it?","Yeah, sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?"
He might hurt you. It's definitely possible.,I'm screwed. Gotta take the car.,No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Varices. You see it with chronic Hep-C all the time.,entering Biopsy's back. Two findings. Number one lymphocytic infiltrate and no bridging fibrosis.,Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
"Well, whatEver's killing him is not Hep-C. It's acute.",Who said that? I forget. What are you doing here? I told you you were off the case.,Knight to queens bishopfive.
"Right. Your diabolic plan to convince the evil genius he's in the clear so he'll let his guard down and make a fatal mistake, sure.","Well, it's clearly not going to work now.","Um, okay, so, um, listen."
What evil genius?,"If we knew that, then we wouldn't need a diabolic plan now, would we?",Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
"Oh, what? One of us?","No, you guys love me too much.","One of us, one of us."
"All right, look, if it's not the Hep-C, then what's the pRoblem? What's causing the liver failure?",Finding number two toxins.,"Phoebe, your liver is right here."
No. He's only 30 years old and his job doesn't expose him to heavy metals or environmental,"He's a 30-year-old mobster. He doesn't have a job that results in accidental exposure to toxins, he has a job that results in intentional exposure to toxins. Someone's poisoned him.","No, no, because, you know, hes been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, hell die."
"He's a 30-year-old mobster. He doesn't have a job that results in accidental exposure to toxins, he has a job that results in intentional exposure to toxins. Someone's poisoned him.","WhatEver this toxin is, it's doing its job and fast. How long do we have until the next round of test results?","Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor."
"What, in two hours?","There is another way. Relax, it's kosher.",In like a halfhour?
"You absolutely do, and I absolutely have the right to humiliate you for it. House enters the lab.",Anything?,"Yeah, you do."
"White blood count's low pRobably a result of the illness, nothing to connect to the liver.",Is he a smoker?,An Altima or better.
Let me check. House goes to look at the chest x-ray.,Early signs of emphysema. He's been smoking at least a dozen years.,"All right. Well, Ill check the guest room."
18. You got that from the white count?,"Nope, got that from the chest x-ray. White count just tells me he's quitting. He goes to look over Cameron's shoulder, who looks uncomfortable.","Ah no. I dont, but it could not have been more than sixty."
Where did you get the money.,"Cancel the thumb screws, I've got our culprit.",Whered you get that kind of money?
"Cancel the thumb screws, I've got our culprit. Who?","Not who, Hu.","Okay, who moved my desk?"
"Not who, Hu. Huh?",Thanks for playing along.,Whom. Thats right.
"So, the mobster's good to go?","I'll keep him overnight, then let the feds know he's good to rat out whoEver he wants.","Wait, when did we start talking about the mob?"
Brother won't be happy.,Maybe have to give back the car.,He wont be mad at me.
You should let Vogler tell the feds.,Why?,"So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?"
"Because it matters to him. Because you humiliated him the first time Joey was released. You think you should still be in third there, ace?",He humiliated himself.,Hes just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
"And because your job depends on the kind of mood Vogler's in at the end of his marathon with Cuddy. Seriously, Man, have you Ever driven an automobile before? There are four gears, you know.",The '66 came with a Shut Up button.,"Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah."
The '66 came with a Shut Up button.,It is my medical opinion that the Patient is healthy and can be released.,Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
to House I see you've found out what we're meeting about.,You're having a meeting?,We have more houses to visit.
"Well, whatEver the reason, the coat looks good on you. looks at the chart Chai Hu lozenges cause this kind of liver failure, no way!","Not by themselves, but in combination with the Interferon it's like gas to a flame.","seriously Gunther you should see someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE!"
"Not by themselves, but in combination with the Interferon it's like gas to a flame. What Interferon?",For the Hep-C.,"Ah. Oh great, now Im gonna get sick."
For the Hep-C. What Hep-C?,Oops.,"Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC."
Is hiding a mobster's Hep-C that important?,Is letting the feds know Everything that important? House's beeper beeps.,"All mobsters have a front, sometimes its selling insurance, sometimes its waste management or sanitation."
"You know, you are a piece of work, Even now.",Ed!,"Im sorry. Honestly, I didnt think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But theres a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you."
Ed! Edward.,Joey's back in a coma.,Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin back.
"Worse than before, he's on a ventilator.","Question is, why? It's not his brain, it's not a toxin. Our friend Babe helped with that one. So what else?",He needs to know.
"The Hep-C. We nEver really treated it, we stopped the Interferon when it started poisoning his liver.",Am I going to have to write a song about it? His chronic Hep-C was not bad enough to produce these symptoms.,"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm."
The estrogen lEvel indiCates it is.,IndiCates something else entirely.,Of course not.
They're running a trial on dogs at St. Sebastian's in Philadelphia. I'll make the call.,as the three others start to leave What else could cause his estrogen lEvel to be that high?,Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
"Maybe there's nothing up there, I watched him like a hawk. Kid cries and screams.",Pretty sure you didn't.,What happened down there?
I didn't let him play with any more little toys.,Thus forcing him to shove a big one up there.,Dont play with his things.
He's not too smart.,"Genetics is a powerful force. On the other hand, maybe he's smarter than you think.","Hes... hes not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing."
What's going on?,Just give me a second.,You know what?
I don't know.,Just tilt his head back.,"Honey, listen, yknow what?"
Your brother was sending in teams to save the cat. Wow.,"Sometimes the simplest answer! He trails off in thought, and Occam's Razor strikes again!","To what, to save your brothers life?"
"Sometimes the simplest answer! He trails off in thought, and Occam's Razor strikes again!",Most types of coma you just don't snap out of. Chase enters.,Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
"He's not snapping out of this one, he's not improving. You crossed out estrogen, you've got an explanation?","Yes, I have. A very simple one.",He saw a therapist?
A very simple one. And?,It's private.,"Good riddle, huh?"
You think I'm the one running to Vogler.,"You're currently top of the list. Toxic comas, person's away from the cause long enough and they recover.",What? Thats the kinda thing you usually run by me.
"The feds checked for poisons, we checked for poisons. I didn't do it.","It's not a poison, then.",Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
"An allergy, then. Did you hear me?",How about a food sensitivity?,"No, I have allergies."
"All of his food is strictly controlled. There's no correlation between his meals and his condition. He had steak and potatoes before the first coma, and the hospital served fish sticks before the second one. You can trust me.","PRoblem is, if I can't trust you, I can't trust your statement that I can trust you. But thanks anyway, you've been a big help.","Well, you know that guy thats on my show thats in a coma?"
"PRoblem is, if I can't trust you, I can't trust your statement that I can trust you. But thanks anyway, you've been a big help.",So where did you get the money?,"That isnt even your problem, the problem is you dont trust me!"
So where did you get the money? What?,Someone paid you off.,"Hey, I know its none of my business, but where did the money come from?"
"What are you talking about? It wasn't poison, you told us that it",You're talking about poison. I'm talking about payoff. Graft.,I promise you it isnt poisoned.
Leave him alone.,You paid the marshal off.,Just ignore him.
I didn't pay him to poison my brother.,"No, it just worked out that way.",He wasnt your brother.
I gave the guy some money to get him some decent food.,Better than fish sticks? I'm thinking steak.,I made sure no one killed him.
We asked for pasta. Those stupid feds could care less,He had steak before both comas.,"Hey, what say we order up some pasta?"
That's it? He stays off the red meat and he's going to be fine?,"Yes. If I'm right, and we stop the current treatment, he gets better. If we stop the current treatment and I'm wrong, he dies.",Youd better run!
Why would you be wrong?,His estrogen lEvel.,I dont know.
What is it?,It's called estrogen.,"You know, this stuff is horrible."
"Joey's taking estrogen? What, he wants a sex change?","No, nothing like that. It's called Male Flame. It's pRobably more consumer friendly in the original Parknese. It's an herbal aphrodisiac marketed to gay men.","Okay Joey? Chandlers here, he was wondering Okay, I guess he ran out of change."
"Oh, here we go.",And sold on the same website that sells his Chai Hu lozenges. Guess what's in it? Starts with an e.,I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here.
"You want to get hit, too?",That would be quite a trick.,I want to hit you.
sitting next to House Joey is not gay.,"Well, maybe not gay, but certainly delightful.","Well, hes definitely not gay."
It's almost like you're scared that it might be true. You're wrong.,"Okay. Then don't stop the treatment. starts to leave But if you're wrong, he dies.",How can I convince you it wont?
"Okay. House nods to Chase, who stops the medicine. He nEver said anything to me about it, not once.","That's what I love about you mob guys so tolerant of others, so accepting.","Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If youre going to stay, youll have to be respectful and quiet."
Vogler wants to fire you. Lose the whole department.,"Good thing you fought for me, though, right?","Oh yeah. Well you cant fire Joseph. You know why, cause hes not in your department."
He threatened to fire me. She sits.,"I'm sorry. So, how long do I have? I've a lot of personal stuff to pack up. I assume you're going to want to throw a party.","Hey, if youre gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too."
"I told him I know where the bodies are buried, the stuff he needs to know that's not in the books. Told him he can't ditch me.","He's only keeping you on because you know the secret handshakes. He's a quick study. Six months, he'll have the moves down. Then he won't need you any more.","Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didnt happen!"
I'll deal with that then.,So I stay.,I can handle that.
Yes. But some things are going to change.,Profits. New world order.,And now everything is going to change?
New world order. Huh.,Everything's about profits.,"Oh, theyre forming an alliance"
"Yeah, that's real new. You could rent out the Corvette Every once in a while, or lend it to a friend.","That would be easy, and it would be wrong.","Use to have two cars, traded em in, now were down to one."
But Cuddy stood up for you.,To a point.,"You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully."
To what point?,I gotta do six more clinic hours a month. So do two of them. nods to the Ducklings on the other side of the wall,"I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. and then I want my nap!"
Why only two?,'Cause one of them's gone.,How come you have two?
"Only 10 more seconds, you got it. Jessica falls to the ground. Jessica, Jessica! He turns her over on her back. Jessica! He listens for her heart beat. CGI of her heart beating fast, and then stopping. Oh, my God! Hey, go to the office, get Miss Parsons. Now! Some kid runs. Mr. Conroy calls 911 on his cell. I'm on a playground at Finley Elementary. One of my students is having a heart attack. Yeah, she's ten. Don't you think I know that? Just send the damn ambulance! He starts chest compressions. Come on, wake up, sweetie.",You Ever see an infected pierced scrotum?,I got it!
"Um, no, but I know a few people on whom I'd like to see it happen. We need to talk.","Well, if pain's what you're after the penis is really the way to go. I'd recommend the apadravya.","No, and so theres no one to walk me down the aisle and."
We're not talking.,Oh? Sounded like we were.,"Okay, Im not talking about this with you."
"No, you're attempting to avoid talking because you know what I want to talk about.",Nipples?,"No, I am saying we are never having this conversation."
You need to get rid of one of your people.,Absolutely.,They are not my people.
"There's no way out on this. You may as well get it over with as fast as you can, like ripping off a band-aid.",Only instead of a two-cent piece of tape and gauze it's a huMan being.,"Theres no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money."
Like you care.,"Like you don't. The elevator opens, rEvealing Cameron.",You think you dont care?
We have a referral from Dr. Linkowitz.,Don't know him.,"Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali."
He knows you.,What's the pRoblem?,How do you know him?
What's the pRoblem? Heart attack.,Definitely don't know him.,"Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, thatthat you should start think about getting a different job."
Ten year olds do not have heart attacks. It's gotta be a mistake.,Right. The simplest explanation is she's a forty-year-old lying about her age. Maybe an actress trying to hang on.,"Thats the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus."
That's because of her depression.,"That's what five pediatricians, two nutritionists, and a psychologist said. The heart attack would seem to indiCate that they missed something.",Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
"Syndrome X could cause a stroke, but I don't know about a heart attack.","Could, if her blood pressure was high enough.","What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?"
"Which is likely, considering her weight.",It fits the symptoms.,"And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it."
"It's really bad, especially at night. It's like my heart is on fire, like it's, uh, oh, I don't know, like it's!",Burning?,I just want it to stop.
Burning? Exactly!,"Hmm, sounds almost like heartburn.","Burnings good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
"So, can you give me something?",Like a thesaurus?,Can I get you anything?
Like a thesaurus? What?,I take it you nEver mentioned this during any of your prenatal visits.,Why dont you use your Thesaurus?
Prenatal? I'm not pregnant.,"Sorry, you don't get to make that call unless you have a stethoscope. Union rules.",What?! What do you mean? Youyouyoure not pregnant?
"I know when I'm pregnant, all right? I have six kids. That's why my husband had a vasectomy and we use condoms.","Vasectomies can rEverse themselves, condoms break.","Oh, I mean, I know youre pregnant."
"Okay. She hops off the table and gestures to herself. This is what a Woman is supposed to look like. Okay, we're not just skin and bones. We have flesh. We have curves.",You have little people inside you.,"Dont stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now theres just a lot of gesturing and armwaving, , Ok, that is either, How could you? or, Enormous breasts! Here he comes!"
"I guess I must have just been brainwashed by the media, and all those years of medical training. Damn right.",Let's see if I can find some antacids while the nurse gets some blood.,"Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me."
"Let's see if I can find some antacids while the nurse gets some blood. Blood, why?","The heartburn, gotta make sure it's not spreading.",Nurse! I just need some water. And my pills. Thank you.
"So, any thoughts?",On what? Sharon's plan for Gaza?,So? What do you think?
Who you're gonna let go.,I'm thinking I can convince Vogler it would be more cost-efficient to let me keep all of them.,I just need the name of who youre planning to let go.
"Yeah, you should be able to pull that off. Most billionaires aren't very good with numbers.","It will be more cost-efficient once I've grabbed Cameron's ass, called Foreman a spade, and Chase! well, I can grab his ass, too.",A man with great ambition and no morals l wouldnt bet against you.
Separate or together?,Together. House leaves Wilson to pay for lunch.,What?! You cant separate them! Thats terrible. Which one?
"Oh, please. Save your pathetic insincerity for your boyfriend. House walks up.","You're wrong. She is, in fact, pathetically sincere. And they didn't screw it up.","No, Im going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!"
Who are you?,"I'm from the lab. The blood tests showed your daughter wasn't hypoglycemic, which means her psychosis wasn't caused by anything these doctors did.","Well, well that one has ducks on his tshirt, and this one has clowns."
So then what was it caused by?,"I have no idea, but you'll be happy to hear it can't be cured by diet or exercise.",Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflins suicide?
"I have no idea, but you'll be happy to hear it can't be cured by diet or exercise.",What else could cause uncontrollable rage in a ten-year-old?,"I dont know, why dont you check me Dr."
Nothing that could also cause a heart attack. House starts to write on the whiteboard.,I assume I don't have to point out that now would be an extremely good time for one of you to distinguish yourself with a brilliant idea.,I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dads fridge was bacon and heavy cream.
Have you Ever met a plastic surgeon who was in their right mind? Cameron looks really pissed.,She hasn't had liposuction.,"Oh Joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix!"
She hasn't had liposuction. Thank you.,But what about some other ridiculous obesity treatment?,"You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she"
But what about some other ridiculous obesity treatment? Like what?,Diet pills can cause heart attacks and blood clots.,Not fat enough already?
Her tox screen was negative.,Wouldn't show over-the-counter weight loss drugs.,She didnt pass.
"sarcastically Yeah, she thinks her daughter's perfect just the way she is.","She's lying. Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prEvent further clotting. And you, to Foreman find those pills.",I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
"She's lying. Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prEvent further clotting. And you, to Foreman find those pills.",shaking the bottle of Vicodin Not diet pills.,Okay I cant let you do this!
"If you're gonna fire someone, go ahead and do it, but don't treat us like lab rats, testing how long it takes us to get us at one another's throats.",So what should I do?,"Okay, look. We cant fire someone because we dont like him."
I don't give a damn what you do.,"Yes, I had noticed your complete indifference. You don't Even offer a medical opinion any more. Who would you fire?",This friend of mine lets call her Noelle she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York.
Not my call.,"I want your opinion. Foreman starts to leave. Fine, it's you. Foreman turns around. Either way, you're making a choice.","I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie."
"Either way, you're making a choice. Chase.",slightly puzzled Wh- Because he screwed up an angio a month ago?,"If you want to chase after her, chase after her."
Anyone can make a mistake.,"Right, it's the money. You resent it, but you're going to tell me he doesn't need the job.","Well, its just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but its a little more complicated than that."
He doesn't appreciate the job.,He was ready to go three rounds with Cameron for it.,Why doesnt he just get another job?
"He wants the job. He just doesn't appreciate it. There's nothing wrong with just wanting to hang out, but this is not the place to do it.",I'm surprised.,Whats he going on about?
You thought I'd pick Cameron?,I didn't think you'd pick at all.,You picked Ross?
I didn't think you'd pick at all.,I guess he's not the rise above the fray guy he likes to think he is.,"Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me."
You practically forced it out of him.,"He's scared of losing his job, just like Everyone else.",I kind of forced you to do it.
I've been thinking. You've made it quite clear that you're miserable here,I am not miserable. They enter the clinic.,"No, no, no, no, youre, youre unhappy there and then youre gonna blame me for making you stay, and its fine, Ill just, Ill suck it up."
You're not happy.,And you are?,You dont look very happy.
"With! my job, yes.",I am exactly where I want to be doing exactly what I want to do.,You want me to work with you?
I think I sense a hint of sarcasm there. Why don't you pick yourself? Quit?,looking at charts Hmmm! I was wrong.,"Hey no, seriously, I dont need you to pick me."
About Vogler or Foreman?,Mrs. Hernandez's pregnancy tests.,"Okay, good, so there you go."
Who's Mrs. Hernandez?,Either a Woman carrying an alien baby or your newest Patient. Wilson grabs the chart.,No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
"The tumor is extremely large, at least thirty pounds. Oh, God.",It's actually a personal record for this clinic.,"Im not a delivery man, Im a doctor."
I'll have a huge scar! I won't be able to wear a bikini!,You wear a bikini now?,Youll be dead.
"Yeah, you got a pRoblem with that?","Nope, but I've nEver gone swimming with you.","You dont have a problem with this, do you?"
I knew it. That's what this is all about! You are trying to force me to have cosmetic surgery!,"Yeah, that's exactly why I planted a thirty pound tumor on your ovary.",I told you not to get the surgery.
That was unexpected.,"nodding Yeah, it was.",What a surprise.
I can't beliEve she was that desperate.,"Yeah, I'm sure that if Everyone I knew hated me, I couldn't bear to look at me. I wouldn't go so far as to shoplift.","Oh, I dont think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!"
Right. He gets up and starts to walk off.,stuttering Wait!,and GRENN start to walk off
Could be something related to the pills. Or not.,"Or both. Diet pills brought her to us, we gave her the sores.","No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff."
You think she got a staph infection from something here?,"I'm not saying the hospital gave the sores, I'm saying we did. By treating her. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.","For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?"
Highly unlikely. We started her on heparin before the warfarin.,Who gave her the heparin?,"Yes, Im very hopeful."
"I gave warfarin, she gave heparin.",Sure you didn't both give her warfarin?,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
"Yes, I did not screw up.",to Chase Did you actually see her prepare and administer the heparin? pregnant pause Enough said.,Incredible. You managed to screw up the screwup.
"Yeah, right. There's gotta be some other cause.",None that I can think of.,"Well, what is the other reason?"
Vogler wants to know what he can do for me.,shouting out the door Hey! Stop worrying about your asses and start worrying about the Patient's.,"So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?"
Wanted to know what warfarin is. I don't know.,Brrrr. Icy. Definitely think twice before correcting one of your mistakes again.,Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
"still at her microscope Correct all you want. Of course, it's a bit more productive if there's an actual mistake.","Right, I always forget that part.","Yeah, she said she corrected him five times."
"I gave her the heparin, which means the necrosis is not a reaction to the warfarin, which is pRobably why she's not responding to your treatment.","Yet. pause If you didn't screw up, then what is it? You don't have an answer.","Well, shes not throwing up, which is a good sign."
You don't have an answer. Yet.,"When you come up with something, let me know. I'll be in the clinic, warming up.","Ask why not again, Ive got an answer."
turning to look at him I'm the only one who's always stood behind you when you've screwed up.,Why? Why would you support someone who screws up?,"Honey, weve been over this."
"Because I'm not insanely insecure. And because I can actually trust in another huMan being and I am not an angry, misanthropic son of a bitch.","I'm sorry, you said you weren't angry. Who would you fire?",So why do you trust me now?
Who would you fire? No one.,Not an option.,I would fire Anthony Gardner.
If Everyone took a pay cut and put in a few more hours we could all stay for the same amount of money.,"Figures you'd try and come up with a solution where no one gets hurt. The pRoblem is, the world doesn't work that way just 'cause you want it to.","Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on."
"getting up Excuse me, Dr. House? My wife saw you yesterday, Lucille Hernandez?","Uh, he's not in today.","Hey, what up, Cynthia?"
My wife said he walked with a cane.,He's also got a bit of a drug pRoblem. Sometimes doesn't show up for weeks. He walks into Cuddy's office.,Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
He's not gonna fire anybody.,Yes.,Im not firing anyone.
"If he can work it so we can keep the current staff for the same amount of money, what difference does it make?",It's not about the money.,"Till then, we need a new acting manager."
What's going on with my wife?,"Even if I was Dr. House, physician-Patient confidentiality protects me from annoying conversations.","Well look, its not easy to spend this much time apart, you know."
But she told me about the tumor.,Yeah? She also tell you why she's refusing to have it removed?,What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
I don't care about a scar. And she can always gain the weight back.,You want her to regain the weight?,"What is it, then?"
"Yeah. I mean, only if she wants to.",Why?,Hell no. She wishes.
I've always thought she's looked sexiest when she was pregnant. House looks slightly disturbed. Something 'bout knowing she's a mother makes me want to,"Yeah, tell her that and leave me alone.","I dont know, God, I."
"I did. You gotta talk to her, I couldn't bear it if something happened to her","The tumor is benign, nothing's gonna happen. Except maybe some more heartburn.","II did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldnt believe me."
What if it gets Even bigger? Or if it changes?,You know where to find us. Building's not going anywhere.,Until we start to look very small.
Tell her it's cancer. House pushes the elevator button. You obviously don't have a pRoblem with lying.,"Oh, way to win me over.",Great. Then she wont know Im lying.
takes out wallet of pictures We have six kids. She can't afford to take a chance.,"You have kids! How novel! That changes Everything. So if Mommy has heartburn, one of them might catch on fire.",Shes not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
"Please, I don't know what we'd do. House takes the pictures.",They are cute. Have her come back in.,"Okay, Okay, All right."
Have her come back in. What?,Your plight has moved me. Elevator dings. Tell your wife to come back.,Well justwell just let her stay.
Maybe because we're treating her for the wrong thing.,Have you found the right thing?,"Look, we just think that maybe shes being a little unreasonable."
Have you found the right thing? No.,Then we continue the treatment. Hope it's just taking longer than it should.,Are we both at the right place?
At this point it doesn't matter what caused the necrosis.,Or who.,The wound has festered.
Get rid of it. Remove the dying flesh before it penetrates the abdominal wall.,Do it.,"Step 1, disinfection."
Can we talk?,"What, no roses, no chocolates? If you're here to apologize",Can I talk to you about something?
I'm not here to apologize.,"Uh-oh, that means you're here for something more compliCated. He takes Vicodin.",I am not going to apologize to you.
Do you want to fire me?,Yes. I was just waiting for an excuse. Thank God Vogler came along. Phew!,"I have to fire someone today, okay?"
It's the only reason I can think of that you're insisting that I made a mistake.,"Really? Because there is another explanation. He stands up. Perhaps not as much fun as your Freudian analysis, but maybe you actually made a mistake.","Oh, there you go again, just another mistake youre throwing in my face."
You're doing this because you can't deal with your feelings for me.,I beliEve that you are the only one to express feelings.,"Fine, just stop thinking about me."
"You're the one being different! You're always pushing things, pushing the rules, pushing us, but not this time. You just jumped on this idea like a life raft. Not one question about what else it could be, no riding us for other answers.",I have the answer.,"Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr."
"Then why aren't you watParkng TV? Or playing your damn Game Boy, or whatEver else you have fun doing by yourself? Maybe I should just quit. Make it easy for Everyone.","Maybe you should. Cameron leaves, making the door shake behind her.","I mean, do you like it?"
"Maybe you should. Cameron leaves, making the door shake behind her.",Men are pigs.,"Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside. Take your time."
You call me in to tell me,"I should have realized the vasectomy and condoms was overkill, but this was too obvious.","Actually, you called me in here, but yeah."
Where'd you get that?,"From the father of three, maximum four of your six Parkldren.",Where did you get this?
You? You're sick.,So are you. I'm sure there are websites full of men looking for married women with surgical scars. He hands her back the pictures. So have the surgery. Please?,"Oh, she sees him!"
Foreman Ever said anything about talking to me? Interesting.,"It's been almost three hours, still no change in her condition.","Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?"
So what do you want to do?,Assume that Cameron didn't screw up. What if it's not the warfarin?,"And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression."
It has to be. The sores presented right after we,"Right, right, right, but let's just say it's not. Come on, come on, what have you got?","Yeah. Im afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals."
Can I have a second to think?,"No, there's no time to think! Say the first thing that comes to you head.","Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?"
That's not what I meant.,We already considered obesity as a cause.,"No, thats not how I meant it."
"No, what if it's not a cause? What if it's a symptom?","Okay, so what could cause obesity and skin necrosis? Listen, I don't care if it makes sense, just give me something.","No, Im Im just saying, we dont know if theres a causeeffect relationship"
Ulcers secondary to vaculitis.,"No, that's just sores, not obesity.",Why is this happening to me?
"No, that's just sores, not obesity. Pyoderma gangrenosum?","More sores. Okay, let's look at it from the other side. What has obesity as a symptom?","Yeah, yeah. Thats, thats fat butt disease. Thats what you suffer from?"
"Genetics are more likely. Her mom's heavy, too.",She's not just heavy. She's tall. We have any history on the dad?,"Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesnt guarantee anything."
We have any history on the dad? Yeah. 6'1.,"Kid's short. We've got stunted growth, high blood pressure, blood clots, obesity it's Cushing's.",Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
"No, necrosis doesn't present in","In rare cases Cushing's can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to the same skin necrosis as warfarin. It's perfect. It explains Everyting.","Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and."
Except it's not Cushing's. She's had multiple blood tests and none show abnormal cortisol lEvels.,"The hypercortisolism could be cyclical, we just didn't catch it in the right phase.","I dont know, shes pretty feisty since they put her on hormonereplacement therapy."
We'll have to do another UFC.,There's no time! We've got less than an hour to make the call.,"Ummm, I think its time to see the ring again."
"If we assume it's not Cushing's, she'll lose her breasts and may still be sick.",Do an MRI.,Maybe shes just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
You want us to look for hypercortisolism with an MRI?,"No, I want you to look for what could cause hypercortisolism with an MRI.",Id love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
It's been a week.,"Actually, it's over a week. Where have you guys been?","Its only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time."
Who is it?,Chase.,You suck man!
"No, Chase stays. Pick someone else.",The deal was,"Yes! Ross, you have to stay!"
Deal's changed. Pick someone else.,No.,I am altering the deal.
"The Senator's suffering from nausea, headache, and mental confusion.","Yeah, bad sushi is so hard to diagnose.",The Senator is exhausted.
"You're being Parkldish. Look, if his case is as trivial as you think it'll take you three minutes to diagnose him.","Uh huh, three minutes that I could spend sitting on the toilet with the funny pages.","All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know its stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
You're mad at me.,closes the door Nope. I nEver liked Cameron or Foreman.,"What, youre mad at me?"
"Do you know why I'm forcing you to fire one of them? Because you need to prove to me that you're a team player. Now, if you did that, you wouldn't need to go through this exercise.",Fine. I'll hold the Senator's hair while he upchucks.,"OK, first, lets go over some parameters."
"as House is leaving Oh, and by the way, I need you to give a speech at the National Cardiology Conference. Next week.",I don't do speeches. I'm shy.,"Oh, cant go today, cause Im donating blood."
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals has dEveloped a new ACE inhibitor. I would like you to extol the virtues of this breakthrough medication.,"Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals! wait a second, don't I own that company? Oh, no, that's right, you do.","No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!"
Viopril is a significant improvement over the old version. All there in the study. He hands House a booklet of information.,I know its price tag is significantly improved.,"Its been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers."
sighs You can either give one ten minute talk and one three minute diagnosis or you can fire one of your pets. My understanding was that you beliEved in rationality above all else. House grabs the Viopril information along with the Senator's chart.,mutters as he leaves Viopril!,Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
"I don't think so. And I don't think that's it, I've been under the weather for weeks, you know. Lots of traveling, supposed to be in the Sudan next week. Beeps are heard from the corner, namely, from House's gameboy.","Helps me concentrate. Puts down Nintendo, picks up Vicodin. Even better than drugs. He pops one to demonstrate.",Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
"When I was six, I fell off the swings and bit my tongue. Couldn't talk right for the longest time. Lots of teasing. But, you know, it just made me fight harder, speak up for those who can't.","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tongues heal too fast. Your political consultants have written you a nice story. In a tight race the lispers alone could put you over the top.","When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, youll get a surprise, and then shed punch me."
"You a Republican, or you just hate all politicians?",I just find being forced to sit through drivel annoying.,How many in your party?
You find sincerity annoying.,You're a black kid from the ghetto who made it to Yale Law and the United States Senate.,"Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying."
"What's wrong? House tests the reflexes himself, no change. What is it?",It's not the food. It's your brain. to Foreman Get an MRI and a lumbar puncture. to Wright Cancel your travel plans.,I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
The LP showed no sign of infection and the MRI was fairly clean.,I guess we can tell him he's fairly healthy and can go home.,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
Most likely just background nose.,Care to bet your job on that? Chase makes a face. What was that?,Doesnt it make her nose look smaller?
What was what?,You got annoyed. That was clearly an annoyed face.,How have you been?
I get annoyed by glib remarks about our futures.,"But last week you didn't get annoyed, you made poopie in your pants. It's weird, it's almost like now you know you have nothing to worry about.","Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing pingpong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark."
Chase has nothing to worry about?,None of you has anything to worry about.,Why would you cancel Jims credit cards?
None of you has anything to worry about. What happened?,Vogler saw the error of his ways and repented.,"Hey, you guys are talking again."
You wanna cut into his brain.,"Dangerous, I know.","Oh, if thats what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table."
"Dangerous, I know. Especially as he's a politician, his brain's all twisted. But I weighed that against the risk of him stroking out before lunch. Call surgery, get it scheduled. He leaves.",You're not pregnant. He hands her some tissues.,"Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? Hell sit down, itll sound like hes flatulent, even though hes not."
"Well, I told you that. But there's gotta be some other reason I'm still spotting.","Sure. You were pregnant. Based on your hormone lEvels, you had a miscarriage.",Calm down. Maybe youre not pregnant.
I haven't Even been on a date.,"charting Right, since it's physically impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner.",Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
I haven't had sex since I split up with my husband. That was almost a year ago.,"Fine, have it your way. Immaculate conception.",How long has it been since you had sex?
"Um, what do I do?","Well, it's obvious. Start a religion. He leaves. As he walks out, Cuddy storms past him.",Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
In my office.,"to the clinic nurse, conspiratorially Afternoon delight. She just loves the hard wood. House enters Cuddy's office.",The Spicy Curry award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!
You're not doing a brain biopsy on a spot on a MRI.,Where'd you get that?,Whos to say you shouldnt be dissecting our brains?
Not on an United States Senator.,"Oh, just so I'm clear, if he was a janitor, that would be okay. Do you have a list?",No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
A brain biopsy can cause perManent neurological damage.,"Uh huh, whereas tumors are really good for brains, make 'em grow big and strong. It's my call.","Yeah, but that doesnt matter, you could get a brain aneurysm"
"No, it's not.",You're pulling rank on Patient care?,"No, it isnt."
It's up to you.,"Either it's a tumor or it's an infection that the lumbar puncture didn't pick up. Either way, if we don't treat it immediately, it could kill you.",Right! We have a semiprivate labor room waiting for you. So in just a minute
W-what caused my s-symptoms?,"Wow, excellent question. Many doctors wouldn't have gone there.","Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?"
It could be a transient ischemic attack. You could make the argument for watParkng carefully for the time being.,"Mmm, but you'd only make that argument if you were an administrator covering your own ass.","No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
"That's absurd, and insulting.","Insulting, yes.",Thats just absurd.
W-what will the voters think? If they find out I've had a b-brain biopsy?,"This could leave you b-b-b-b-brain damaged, and you're worried about NASCAR dads?","Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?"
It's not a brain tumor.,"It's not a bacterial infection, either.","If it were your head, it would be."
So you biopsied his brain for nothing.,"If that were true, would Dr. Wilson's mouth be contorted into that ugly little shape?","I cut his head off, so no."
It's toxoplasmosis. You sure?,Which means the Great Black Hope has full-blown AIDS. They're gonna love that in Dubuque.,"Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said its snot. I am so sorry."
"Theoretically, certain cancers","If you have toxo in your brain, you have AIDS.","There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005."
"forcefully and painfully I do not have AIDS. I don't sh-sh-shoot up drugs, I don't sl-sleep with!",This is very bad news.,Did you say youve got AIDS?
quietly We will.,"But the toxo drugs are going to piss off your fungi, and when fungi get pissed Senator Wright throws the pills.","Yeah, but if we stay there, we wont have to be quiet."
I am not gonna take the pills.,"You're afraid word will leak out. Trust me, you're not going to become President either way. They don't call it the White House because of the paint job.",Was she helping him with his research?
House nEver gives speeches. House enters.,"But when I really beliEve in something! Gosh dang it, I've got a chance to make a difference here.",House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.
You made a deal with Vogler?,"It's all the rage. Everybody's doing it. Chase gives House a petty, pouty look and goes to sulk in a chair. Cameron walks over to House.",Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
"So, what's the deal? You get to keep all of us if you plug his products?","One speech, no biggie. Foreman's doing a bone marrow biopsy to check for cancer.",And yknow what I said to him?
Cancer? The Senator's got AIDS.,Cancer sounds better on a press release. I need you guys to rush the ELisatest for HIV. He starts to walk into his office.,"Im sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge."
Thank you. For the speech.,"When I said rush, I meant, you know, fast. Stat's the word you doctors use, right?","Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, youre a good guy."

Do you know why people beliEve in God?,I thought you didn't beliEve in God.,Or maybe theres a God.
I thought you didn't beliEve in God. I don't.,"Well, then you better be making a very good point.","Erin, I am in love with you."
Do you think they pray to Him and praise Him because they want Him to know how great He is? God already knows that.,"Are you comparing me to God? I mean, that's great, but just so you know, I've nEver made a tree.","You worship Him in your way, and Ill worship Him in mine."
smiling I thank you because it means something to me. To be grateful for what I receive.,You are the most nave atheist I've Ever met.,Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
"Dr. House, you have a Patient in Room One.","Thank God. He walks off, but turns around. People pray so that God won't crush them like bugs. I'm not gonna crush you.",Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? moves hands around motioning just these rooms To Ross I thought you were a doctor.

"Well, it can't be a hickey.",exasperated Why is Everybody so ashamed of sex all of a sudden?,"We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money getis that a hickey?"
I'm not having sex. I've barely Even thought about sex since my marriage. House pulls a hair from Sarah's head. Ow!,"I say you're having sex, you say you're not. Either you're lying, or I'm wrong. Or there's some middle ground.","Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight."
You mean like oral?,"I mean you're having sex without knowing it. I'm testing you for booze, drugs and GHB.","You mean, like in bed or in the shower?"
"I don't drink, and! what's GHB?",The date rape drug. He leaves.,"And for the record, bleugh."
The date rape drug. He leaves.,It's positive.,The Fertility Clinic Chandler walks out one of the rooms
"I've only had two girlfriends. Two, after my wife died. I used c-c-condoms.",You know the chances of you getting HIV from heterosexual sex with a condom?,"Alright, before I tell you, uh, why dont you tell me how many women youve been with."
You know the chances of you getting HIV from heterosexual sex with a condom? Yes.,Some day there will be a black president.,"I know. I know, but yknow condoms only work like 97% of the time."
"It must be miserable, always assuming the worst in people.","Oh, cut the crap, you're dying.",Do you know what its like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
"You're clEver, you're witty, and you are a coward! You're scared of taking chances.","I take chances all the time, it's one of my worst qualities.","You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
"I take chances all the time, it's one of my worst qualities. On people?",Wanting to beliEve the best about people doesn't make it true.,Im not always that bad!
Being afraid to beliEve it doesn't make it false.,"Well, that's very moving. It's a shame I don't vote.",I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen.
"This is who I am. I beliEve in people. I'm not hiply cynical and I don't make easy, snide remarks. I would rather think that people are good and be disappointed once and again. House gets up and grabs a syringe and some rubber gloves from a cabinet.",I need to draw some more blood.,"Do you believe in me, Phyllis?"
The antiretrovirals aren't working.,That's not surprising.,"No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS."
"He's just going to keep getting worse. You realize that, right?",Why are you spying on my case?,Think hes getting any better?
Why are you giving that speech next week? House pushes the elevator button. We're both just doing what we have to do.,And you don't see a pRoblem with that?,Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
"Checking in on a Patient? Yeah, wow, how do I look myself in the mirror?",You're not the one being asked to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.,"Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, hes like early to midthirties, very attractive."
It's a ten minute speech!,That I've been ordered to give.,Come on! Speech!
Vogler's drug works!,Don't care.,Shhh. Dont be scared. It works. ...oh no.
"Oh, why do you have to make Everything so dramatic? Elevator dings.","Because I'm a very high-strung little lapdog. as he enters the elevator Ruff ruff ruff, rarr, ruff! Cuddy looks faintly disgusted.","Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?"
"Because I'm a very high-strung little lapdog. as he enters the elevator Ruff ruff ruff, rarr, ruff! Cuddy looks faintly disgusted.",standing in the back of the room Nuh uh. No pills.,"Is it, is it because youre afraid of where this is gonna take me?"
What's going on?!?,The antiretrovirals aren't working.,What the hell is going on?
The antiretrovirals aren't working. Why not?,Because you don't have AIDS. The Senator laughs. The first test was a false positive. Happens one time in Every five thousand.,"All Im saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why cant they do something about lactose intolerance?"
You r-ran a second test.,Yeah. You're still dying. The only difference is now we don't know why.,That was a test and you just failed.
Why are we doing this here?,"So Cuddy can't find us. Unless we find out the underlying disease, this guy's lied to his last constituent.","Okay, Im gonna need you to print it out."
looking at the chart False negative on the PCR AIDS test?,Ran it twice.,Thats why I added the tator.
Ran it twice. Immunoglobulin deficiency?,No history of respiratory pRoblems.,Its okay. Go take the test and see if were okay.
Idiopathic T-cell deficiency.,"Idiopathic, from the Latin meaning we're idiots 'cause we can't figure out what's causing it. He takes a Vicodin. Give him a whole body scan.",Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
You hate whole body scans.,'Cause they're useless.,Send a scanning crew on board.
Why did you order the second AIDS test?,Standard procedure.,"Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?"
"Oh, well, that's you. Mr. Standard Procedure. You suspected the first test was a false positive?",I knew he was going to Africa and I figured he was vaccinated for Hep A and B. That could cause a false positive.,"Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much."
"Yeah, but you knew that before you ordered the first test. What changed?",I should have ordered both.,"Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that."
"You were sure he had AIDS, then you talked to him, then you had doubts. What, what did he say?",He said he had not engaged in any risky behavior.,I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Huh. And you beliEved him.,"Well, he didn't have any reason to lie",And you were dumb enough to believe him?
"Everybody lies, except politicians? House, I do beliEve you're a roMantic. You didn't just beliEve him, you beliEved in him. Do you want to come over tonight and watch old movies and cry? House gives a great-looking smirk. Dr. Cameron's getting to you. Well, I guess you can't be around that much niceness and not get any on you.",Is that why you haven't put the moves on her?,"Ooh, honey. You stink at lying."
"What makes you think I haven't put the moves on her? House stops and stares, then realizes he fell for Wilson's trap. Oh. Oh, boy! You're in trouble. Wilson laughs and walks off. House walks into Exam Room One, where Sarah awaits.",You have restored my faith in the huMan race. You're lying.,"Well, she moved in across the hall."
"No, I'm not lying.","I just got your results back. No GHB, no nothing. It means you're having sex, and you're lying about it.","Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties."
"No, and I have a new symptom. I have a rash on my butt. She smiles triumphantly. Do you want to! House nods, resigned. Sarah lowers her pants so House can see. What is it?",It's a carpet burn.,Do you have fever?
"No, I just wake up really exhausted.",Is something upsetting you?,"No, but I was awake all night."
"No. House gives her a look. My ex lives in the apartment downstairs. He's always calling me, always wanting to get back together, complaining about mixed signals. Get out of my life, how much clearer can you get?","We have a sleep lab in the basement. If nothing else, it'll get you away from your ex for a night.","Well, yes, but youre the one who said hello to her when she moved in."
Slightly enlarged lymph node in his left armpit.,How slightly?,It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Cuddy enters. Lymphoma?,"Sure, or he's had a cold in the last six months. to Chase What, you've got her on speed dial?",well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
Looks complex. Central necrosis?,"Spontaneous bleeding, it's benign. I was rooting for a really cool tumor, instead we're stuck with this crap.","All right, uh Oh hey, youve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
"Doesn't matter. Once you find 'em, you've gotta check 'em.","Well, knock yourselves out. Vogler enters.","It doesnt matter, right now youre looking for treasure."
"I just saw Senator Wright, he looks like hell. That sushi must have been a lot worse than you thought.","Mr. Vogler, would you like a free whole body scan? A Man of your stature should get himself checked at least three times a year.","Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldnt it? If Id brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai."
Here's a few key points I want you to cover during your speech.,Fourteen pages. The audience will be comatose by paragraph two.,Why dont you go up on stage.
Throw in a joke. Vogler leaves.,Dr. Chase. We need to talk.,"People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one."
Dr. Chase. We need to talk.,How do you see this ending?,"Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?"
How do you see this ending? What ending?,"I can't fire you, so you have no reason to fear me, and therefore no reason to lie to me.","Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, Ive got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good."
pause Yeah.,So how can I work with you?,Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.
I hope so.,I am selling my soul.,I downloaded it on her computer.
Just a little piece. And you are getting something in return.,"I said I was selling it. I didn't say I was giving it away. That would be immoral, and stupid. All they've done is added antacid.",I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
Does it work?,That's not the point!,Does this work for you?
"Well, of course it's the point! He's not asking you to lie, he's not asking you to do something illegal",He's not asking me to do anything.,It is not a lie.
"Kidney and liver cysts are both benign, and lymph nodes all came back clean.",His left armpit node has antibodies for CB 11.,"Oh hey! So, how did your doctors appointment go?"
"Well, not enough to indiCate lymphoma.",We nEver tested for hairy-cell leukemia.,"Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you."
And his spleen isn't enlarged.,Size isn't Everything. The spleen is the mother lode for hairy-cells. Let's cut it open.,Actually hes the smallest person in the world.
"In the Senator's condition, a spleen biopsy could easily cause sepsis and kill him!","Why do you do this to me? Now, if I kill him, I can't tell the Judge I had no idea of the risks involved.",The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
"His brain's turning into mush, and he's at risk for more infections, so we have to do it.","See, that'll sound much better in court.",We need to make him feel better.
Yeah. What's up?,You like me. Why?,"Uh, yeah, sure."
That's kind of a sad question.,Just trying to figure out what makes you tick. I am not warm and fuzzy and you are basically a stuffed animal made by grandma.,"Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did."
I don't think that's why you're asking. I think it's because of the speech.,"muttering Oh God, don't try and pick me apart.",Whats a matter Ross?
"No, his bone marrow's indeterminate, spleen's the only way to go.","standing by the window. You know, when the Inuit go fishing, they don't look for fish. Every looks at House for a bit, but he remains silent.",Relax. Were the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ.
"sighing Why, Dr. House?","They look for the blue heron, because there's no way to see the fish.","Hey, Meredith. Can I talk to you privately for a second?"
HTLV and ATLV.,We can test for them. Run the titers.,"Oh, II think Im gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out."
We can test for them. Run the titers.,These were your brain waves at 245 AM.,We test a lot of urine.
That would explain why I'm so tired when I wake up.,"Yes, and also why you were pregnant. And the hickies. And the carpet burn.",Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not.
I had sex in my sleep?,Sexsomnia is a documented disorder. You said your ex lives downstairs,"Well, I should think so."
I'll kill him.,"Okay, but he pRobably didn't know that you were asleep.","Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!"
"He's my ex, I","You live in the same building, you haven't had sex with anyone else for a year, you sleepwalk right into his arms. Call me crazy, but I'm sensing unresolved issues.","Oh, gosh. Sorry, Ive just spent the whole night talking about your exboyfriend. Im such an idiot."
Negative for HTLV-1 and 2 and ATLV and Everything else. It's not hairy-cell. He stops House. Hey. You really gonna give that speech?,"You've got an opinion, too?","Rach, I think Im gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I dont want to infect him."
"I'm a little surprised. Frankly, I thought you were too much of a self-absorbed ass to do this for us.",You're welcome. He's positive for Epstein-Barr.,I dont know why Im surprised.
House pushes the chart at Foreman and walks off very quickly. Hey!,You didn't fall off the swings when you were eight.,Richard buzzed. Hes waiting downstairs.
You didn't fall off the swings when you were eight. Six!,Ever.,"No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasnt the swings fault. It was my fault and kind"
Give that back!,Uh uh. We have to talk. You had an epileptic seizure. That's how you bit your tongue.,And I was thinking its only fair that you help make this decision since theyll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
I haven't had a seizure since I was,What medication did you take?,"I dont have epilepsy, either."
No seizure since I was six. No drugs since I was ten!,"Yeah, that's it. Don't worry about what the question is, don't worry that you're starting to feel dizzy, just stay on message.","Well I dont know, II suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel!"
frantic now My mother used to call it physofin,Phenytoin?,"Oh, yeah, thats the word I use when I cant remember the real thing."
"Yeah! House places the breathing mask back on the Senator's face. Okay, okay, you're okay, it's okay. Everybody lies.",Senator Gary H.,"Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he cant lie with his body."
CVID? That's a type of immunoglobulin deficiency. I said that.,"Yeah, well, it was a stupid idea when you said it. Then he got the respiratory pRoblem and tested positive for Epstein-Barr.",We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear.
That's pretty much a Parkldhood disease.,Another reason why Chase's suggestion was idiotic.,"Fat butt disease, Michael?"
So you're basing your diagnosis on a disease that's relatively common and a drug he took thirty years ago.,"Start the senator on IV immunoglobulin stat. If he gets better, I'm right, if he dies, you're right.",And youre quite certain he died of a natural illness?
"If he gets better, I'm right, if he dies, you're right. Dr. House!",You faked that.,How long will he be gone?
You faked that. No.,Say antiretroviral.,What!? You faked it?
Say antiretroviral. Antiretroviral.,Now say it three times fast.,"I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me."
Am I well enough to run for president?,"Well, why not run for pope while you're at it?",Am I not a serious candidate?
"Oh, come on. Kennedy had Addison's, FDR had polio. Two of the best presidents in the last hundred years",If they were running today they wouldn't stand a chance.,"So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?"
"So, you figure you'd be Surgeon General if you didn't have the limp.","No, there's things I can't do, and like you said, I have to live with reality.","Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someones spinal cord."
"No, don't get excited, he's right, I, uh, I won't win.",Then why run?,"No, no, no."
"But hey, why listen to me? I own the company, I'm certainly not to be trusted, right? Dr. Gregg House, on the other hand, has a reputation. For integrity, among other things. Crowd chuckles. Quick shot of Wilson, Cuddy, Chase and Cameron sitting at a table in the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gregg House. House stands up and walks to the podium to applause. The PPTH table looks slightly apprehensive, as if their jobs were riding on what is to happen next. Well, I guess when you think about it! We see Foreman for the first time, leaning against a doorway. House adjusts the microphone, and!","reading off a paper, very monotone Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals' extraordinary commitment to research excellence is exemplified by their new ACE inhibitor, a breakthrough medical approach that will protect millions from heart disease.","Thats crazy. Thats crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin with suppliers! Hooooh! Wow! What time we got? You know what? Thats a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Whos to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, lets give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work. Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate."
"quietly, yet deadly That's not a speech.","I thought it was pithy. You got enough for a press release, anyhow.","Well, Im not really one for making speeches."
Foreman or Cameron? House gives a little smile and goes back to the podium.,A few things I forgot to mention.,"Ross, hes got the remote again."
"A few things I forgot to mention. Ed Vogler is a brilliant businessMan. A brilliant Judge of people, and a Man who has nEver lost a fight. You know how I know the new ACE inhibitor is good? Because the old one was good. The new one is really the same, it's just more expensive. Vogler does not look happy. A lot more expensive. See, that's another example of Ed's brilliance. At this point, Wilson looks mildly interested, Cuddy looks mad, and Chase and Cameron look like the world's about to end. WhenEver one of his drugs is about to lose its patent he has his boys and girls alter it just a tiny bit and patent it all over again. Making not just a pointless new pill, but millions and millions of dollars. Which is good for Everbody, right? Cuddy is now shaking her head in disbelief, and Wilson is staring pointedly. The Patients, pish. Who cares, they're just so damn sick! God obviously nEver liked them anyway. Cuddy furious Wilson facepalm. Chase downs his whole glass of wine, and Cameron is staring at the table's centerpiece. All the healthy people in the room, let's have a big round of applause for Ed Vogler! House claps, Foreman shakes his head, the rest of the room stays silent. Vogler, well, he doesn't look happy at all. As House hands Vogler the paper -- I threw in a joke.",I'm sorry. I should have taken a couple of extra Vicodin and just held my nose.,"Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then yknow you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow."
I'm guessing you did take a couple extra Vicodin.,True.,"Wheres the Advil, Jim?"
You don't need to worry about firing anyone. I'm leaving.,"Why? Is this another noble, self-sacrificing gesture? You trying to protect Foreman?","If you left, I wouldnt have to fire anybody."
You trying to protect Foreman? No.,"So this is just, Don't fire me, I quit.",I promise you Tommens safe.
Heh. Look for a shallow grave with Vogler standing over it.,You have a Stage 4 cancer.,What does it look like Im doing?
"Thank you, Doctor. You've been so good to me.","Well, I did publicly bash your company's drug.","Thanks for being with us today, Dr."
When I think about how I treated you!,"Oh, hey, come on. House gets up and walks to behind Vogler, sans cane and limp. He rests his hands on Vogler's shoulders. There, there, there. Vogler sniffles.","It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay?"
"So, um, there is some hope?","Always. But just in case, I special-order an extra jumbo-size coffin.",Perhaps theres hope for you after all.
"But just in case, I special-order an extra jumbo-size coffin. Hey!",Don't thank me. It's just who I am.,"Good, cause I got you everything you need to make it."
"Up and at 'em, big guy. House blinks and rubs his eyes.","Sorry, up late. Internet porn.",Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
How come you're not in your office?,"Because there is a computer in my office. If I log on, roMance will ensue. My wrist might fall off.",You didnt call my office and ask where I was?
Hiding because Vogler's looking for you. That's just pathetic.,"I don't like loud, angry giants threatening me with violence. How is that pathetic?",What are you doing hiding back there?
You think you can avoid firing one of us by hiding out here? He'll find you sooner or later.,getting a drink I'm okay with later.,"Well, youre the one who wants to fire him, so youre gonna have to do it."
"holds out chart 39-year-old female, 28 weeks pregnant, G 4, P 0.",Three miscarriages? Gimme. takes the file,"Pretty positive. Thats a joke, because the pregnancy test says"
Altered mental status and complete loss of coordination.,Tox screen?,Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
Negative for alcohol and drugs. She was on oxybutynin.,For incontinence.,That was before our relationship.
The three miscarriages make me think it's an underlying physiology.,"Pregnancy-related autoimmunity. Too bad that Cameron quit, I could use an immunologist right now. We'll see if you're right check the blood.","You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years."
We'll see if you're right check the blood. Cameron quit?,"Last night. And do an MRA for vasculitis, too.","Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared."
There is no way she quit! She got fired because you couldn't swallow your pride!,"An ultrasound? Excellent thought! And put her on magnesium, too, in case it is preeclampsia. He takes a Vicodin.",Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... thats nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memoed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
"She gets sick a lot but this, this cold got really bad all of a sudden. And the fEver! to the baby Shhhh, it's okay.",It's not a cold. hands the baby back to Rachel It's pneumonia.,"Yeah, shes been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem Phlegm!"
hands the baby back to Rachel It's pneumonia. Pneumonia?,"Relax, pneumonia's her second-biggest pRoblem.",Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
"But it's healthy, raw food. We're vegans. Almond milk, tofu, vegetables!",Raw food.,"Cant have?! Excuse me, the only thing I cant have is dairy!"
Is she gonna be all right?,"Antibiotics for the pneumonia, IV feeding to get the weight up. Don't worry, it's a vegan IV.","If youre worried, we can go over there and see if shes all right."
Okay. They inject her with the medication.,Whoa!,How else is she supposed to take it?
"In the morning, I expect you in my office with your letter of resignation and plans for a public apology, otherwise I'll destroy you. House looks a little shocked as Vogler walks off.",So that's a 'no' on us being squared away.,"Michael, its not how you leave in an office."
"to House, who is rummaging through the cabinets Great to see you back in the office. I guess Vogler found you?","Yeah, we had a nice little chat. I really should have kept Cameron. She knew where to find the sugar.","Im back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem."
"It's what I said. Preeclampsia. A little stress from the MRA, she pops straight into labor.",Ah ha! He shakes a packet of sugar triumphantly.,"She doesnt have a stomach ache, shes in labor."
"She choked, she couldn't Even swallow.",What did she choke on?,"And she took a bite, started to choke."
Her food. The muscle weakness isn't a symptom of preeclampsia.,What kind of food?,She doesnt have a stomachache.
"A little bit of cooked pear, it doesn't matter! It shows weakness.","She choked on soft, wet pear. Did she forget to take the bones out? That's way past muscle weakness. Did you do an upper endoscopy?","I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt."
We've gotta talk.,Oooh. We've gotta talk. as he leaves And check her eyelids.,We kinda need to talk.
"Special board meeting today, only one item on the agenda you.","Well, enjoy the bagels. I'm untouchable.",Please take an agenda item.
I'm untouchable. Huh. Right.,Any vote to revoke my tenure has to be unanimous. I've got you and maybe Even Cuddy.,"Speaking of untouchables, Ive got great news for you guys."
"Oh, well that settles it. Mr. Ruthless Corporate Raider will be stymied, go home, curl up on the floor of his shower and weep.",What can he do? I've got a contract.,And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer.
Does it say how much your team gets paid? Where your Parking space is? If your car should be filled with horse Manure? Vogler's smart he's got some plan to get you.,"Does it involve candy? Because I'm a sucker for chocolates. Wilson gives him a look and walks away, House takes a Vicodin or two.",It says that I believe that my staffs intelligence and that Im willing to try anything.
"Does it involve candy? Because I'm a sucker for chocolates. Wilson gives him a look and walks away, House takes a Vicodin or two.",She's doing better.,Huh. Do you like candy?
"Oh, thank God.","Technically, Alexander Fleming. He dEveloped antibiotics. Pneumonia's under control, and from now on, what say you stick with huMan food.","Oh, but, could we not go together?"
"Absolutely, swear to God.","This time, that's your guy. House stars to leave, but is blocked by a bunch of people entering the room, including police Officers.",Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
"Starving your kid. I'm from Social Services, we're taking responsibility for your baby. They all leave, leaving House standing there.",This is how Vogler's gonna destroy me?,"Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them."
"What did he do, grease your cane?",He had my Patients arrested.,He touched my fanny.
"He didn't, I did. The nurses were concerned and they called me. There was evidence of abuse you took a big legal risk by not calling Social Services.","Those parents were not abusive, they're idiots.",Were you the ones called the cops?
"Oh, well that's certainly a relief.",It was my call.,"Okay well, thats a relief!"
You made the wrong one.,"You know, there's a new biography of Quisling, I think you might like it.",You got to stop beating yourself up over this.
Sure. No idea who that is.,"Uh, Norwegian guy, World War II, traitor. The fact that I have to explain this kind of takes the edge off my flow.","No, IIII dont, I actually dont know who Im talking about!"
I was protecting you.,From what? Cops aren't gonna bust me. Disiplinary committee maybe gives me a slap on the wrist.,"Okay, instead of protecting me, why dont you try being excited when something good happens?"
And Vogler has an excuse to get rid of you.,"If I don't give him one, he makes one up.","Hey, Halpert, whats the big idea?"
Maybe it's a granuloma.,No. There's no calcification.,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Naomi is refusing to have the C-section. Her odds aren't good enough.,They do suck. Where's Wilson?,Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
She's saving her Parkld. Cameron would point out that people are capable of sacrifice.,Cameron isn't here.,She has something to live for now.

Got a better idea?,Stop it.,Ive got a better idea.
But nEver out of the country.,What else? Come on! He leaves the room.,"Uh, not on a three month boat trip."
What else? Come on! He leaves the room.,"to Chase and Foreman, who just walked up We're missing something.","Do you want us to leave the room, or?"
"to Chase and Foreman, who just walked up We're missing something. What?","Well, if I knew that it wouldn't be missing.","So, what did we miss?"
Maybe she's adopted and we've got the wrong history.,"No, she's got her mom's eyes and a red patch of hair just like dad.","Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit."
"Could explain the rash and muscle pain, but not the bleeding or seizures.",That's a lot of balloons.,"you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, its so healthy Im always like is this moving to fast?"
Think she's allergic to polyester?,Not unless she's been competing in the nude all these years.,"Well, shes very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin."
Then what are you thinking? What do the balloons mean?,What if the rash isn't a rash?,"Dwight. This, fits in the palm of my hand. You havent blown em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?"
What are you talking about?,Who gave her the balloons?,"Way to go, Phoebe!"
"Some of the girls from her team. They've been visiting her pretty regularly, but none of them are sick.",What about the guys?,"Uh, some of her friends, yeah."
None of them are sick either.,Which guys visited her?,Im with you Chandler!
"Which guys visited her? Actually, none.","She's cute, she's nice, she's a kick-ass diver. You'd think the guys would be falling over themselves to get close to her.","Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoawhoa, short message."
She's 12. The youngest guy on her team is 16.,"Okay, so maybe they're just not interested. Or!",Shes in middle school.
They're avoiding her.,There any cell fragments in her blood smears?,Why isnt she with them?
"No, red blood cells were intact.",Check 'em again.,"No, Ill be fine."
"Blood looks like it's been put through the blender, now. House enters.",You done yet?,Ah! Blood everywhere.
It's purpura. Thrombocytopenia purpura?,Starts with T. You were so close.,Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information Im a doctor.
"What could have set it off? She had no trace of E. Coli in her cultures, she's obviously not menopausal, so no estrogen.",There is one other possible cause.,"Oh, I know that now."
"There is one other possible cause. Oh, God.",Pregnancy cause all kinds of chemical and biological changes in a Woman's body.,"Well, if theres another explanation, I dont really see what it could possibly be."
It wasn't like that.,Of course not. You wanted it.,It was not.
"Yeah, I did. He turned out to be a jerk, but!","Actually, under New Jersey law the term is 'felon.'",Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
I knew what I was doing.,We're going to have to do something called plasmapheresis. It cleans the antibodies from your blood. We're also going to have to terminate the pregnancy.,"No, its too wrinkly to be a mole."
You're going to tell my parents?,Someone should. Rock paper scissors?,Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
They don't need to know. I'll be all right.,Of course you will.,"Oh, good. Okay. Dont tell me, tell them."
You're going to tell my parents?,"Under New Jersey law, you're the boss.",Im gonna tell Mom.
"Under New Jersey law, you're the boss.","Your daughter has TTP. Don't worry, it's curable, she'll be fine.","Wait, so youre the boss?"
"Well, wait! What does TTP stand for?",Some really big words that you've nEver heard before and when we're done we'll nEver hear again. Have a nice day.,"T! Yes! Yes! That is a T, and theres another one right there. Just sound that out. Youre almost there."
"Well, when can we take her home?","Uh, in a few days. She needs some minor surgery to remove the underlying cause before we can do the! another really big word.","Well, Ill probably be back to pick her up around six, but shes in the bedroom all ready to go."
What's the underlying cause?,She has an abnormal growth in her abdomen.,"Um, loneliness. Maybe women."
What kind of surgery?,It's very simple. We do it here all the time.,Why would you have surgery?
Could you be a little more specific?,"Actually, no. I'm sorry.",Youre gonna have to be more specific.
"walking up Plasmapheresis is working, she's going to be fine.",I know.,Shes gonna be fine.
"I can't Even tell you how much I appreciate the opportunity to meet with you. And House! remains silent. The moment I heard you had another fellowship opening, I",There is no opening.,"Youre welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace."
"House, you have to hire someone.",I know. The position's been filled.,"A house, where?"
Why am I interviewing for a position that's already been filled?,Exactly. He gets up to leave.,Well why didnt you take the job?
I called to confirm the interview this morning.,"You figure if you keep arguing I'm going to cave, admit it's all a lie, and hire you? He leaves.","You know, I always feel that way after an interview."
Do you need your Parking validated?,I don't want to interview anyone else.,"Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?"
You're interviewing? I thought you'd just have them send a headshot along with their CV.,Hah. That's good. And why I need you around. To keep me in my place. He keeps trying to look into Cameron's apartment. Heh.,"Okay! If youre not going to interview me, then Ill do it."
"I can't come back, I told you that.",Wasn't listening.,Im not coming back.
Wasn't listening. Right.,You want me to listen to you more? I can do that.,"Honey, Im not even going to pretend I was listening."
Right. I already accepted a position somewhere else.,With who?,Then you leave me no choice.
"Yule, at Jefferson.",Unaccept it.,At Monica and Rachels.
Unaccept it. Why?,Because Yule is boring. He's pedantic and preachy. Because he's short. Because I want you to come back.,"Well, it is very gracious of you to accept."
Not good enough.,"Want more money? A car allowance, better Parking space?",Good enough to get fired.
Dinner. And not just a meal between two colleagues. A date.,You'll come back to work if I go out on a date with you?,"Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?"
You'll come back to work if I go out on a date with you? Yes.,"Okay, it's a deal. They shake on it.","You go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
See you tomorrow morning.,Don't be late.,See you tomorrow.
Who's coming back?,You don't know her.,I dont know.
You give her a raise? Increase her benefits?,"Don't have TiVo on this thing, can't rewind. Shut up.",Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?
You lower her hours?,You don't Even know her.,"So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?"
Who is this guy?,He's a Patient.,Whos this guy?
He's examining me.,"He's got to go back to work as soon as I'm done with the examination. Guess I do, too.","Oh, he watches you from his car with highpowered binoculars."
Heh heh! You dog! You slept with her!,Keep talking. I'll finish your exam with a prostate check. to Wilson I've agreed to take her on one date.,Nope! I still cant believe she slept with you in the first place.
"So, you in to this girl? Yes",No! She's not giving me any choice. Wilson now looks a bit puzzled.,"So, is it serious, do you like her?"
Wait! she's making you do her?,Date her.,What if she makes me?
"putting an arm around House's shoulders Do her, or you're gay. Wilson thinks about that one. Heh.",For God's sake. He grabs his TV and leaves. As he's walking out the door --,"Um, well, Howard and Christie are kind of hooking up in my bedroom."
"kind of singing Sitting in a tree, K-i-s-s-i-n-g.","over them Grow up. And learn to harmonize. He shuts the door and runs into Harvey, who spills an open cup of liquid on him. Damn it!","Wait, wait. Lets sing it as a round. Ill start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur See thats where you come in. Ill start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur Ive got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,Who the hell walks around with an open urine sample?,"Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry."
You think that was a bit of an overreaction?,"Well, he peed on me. I'm not into that. Wilson sniffs House's jacket.",That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
It's apple juice. Now go find that Man and apologize. One more Patient complaint and you're looking at a suspension. He takes House's TV and goes back into the exam room.,I forgive you for ruining my jacket.,At his apartment.
Game's over. You two make nice?,"Get a wheelchair, and get this guy into the ER.","The game is over, we eat now?"
"Get a wheelchair, and get this guy into the ER. What happened?",Right pupil's blown.,How did you get in your wheelchair?
Then why'd you do it?,"entering with Wilson Cause this is the happiest place on Earth. 21-year-old male, comes in with grinding of the teeth.",IIm just trying to figure out why you would do this.
Blown pupils usually means brain stem edema.,"Sure, but since he's not dead or in a coma, I'm going with stroke to the optic nerve.","Ok here you have just knocked over the beaker, the chemicals splashed in your eye."
"Ischemia. Death of brain tissue. Means there's been some damage, hopefully not perManent.",And?,When a girl sees blood and collapses.
That's it. There's nothing there to tell us what the underlying cause is. We've got to do an MRI.,You're looking at the wrong part of the scan.,From you. Im sure its probably nothing. But whats with the yoga already?
"No, the jaw tells us why we can't do an MRI. Unless we want his jawbone flying across the room.",Metal plate.,"Hey, the jaw wants what it wants."
Hi. I'm having vaginal pain.,Pleasure to meet you. Vicodin goes pop!,"Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor."
My OB/GYN died recently. He's a nice Man. Warm hands.,"sitting and putting on rubber gloves Not anymore. So, does it hurt when you tinkle?","Yeah, Ive, Ive outlived a few of my doctors, too."
"Yeah, it's when it's worse. House performs the exam.",You have some vaginal tearing.,"Yeah, but its not always that bad."
Myron thought he'd just try them out!,Lucky you.,He didnt try them yet!
Lucky you. I guess.,Prefer it if Myron was a little droopier?,I guess I am lucky.
"Maybe a little. We used to hold hands, read together, or watch Jeopardy! I haven't seen Jeopardy! in almost a month!",going for the big question Have you talked to him about this?,"No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, were both hardcore into quilting."
"You try talking a 73-year-old out of sex. With all these male enhancements the pressure to put out's incredible. It's worse than high school. He doesn't get what he wants from me, he'll get it from Connie in the corner condo. She's dying her hair red! Major league slut. House and the nurse share a look.",Here's a prescription for vaginal estrogen suppositories. It'll help with the lubrication.,Howards mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she cant.
Thank you. Maybe you could give Myron a prescription. Something weaker than he's got now? Tell him it's better for his heart he'd buy that.,"You can't tell him the truth, so you want me to lie to him?","All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company."
"You can't tell him the truth, so you want me to lie to him? Would you?",Close your legs. He leaves.,Why are you lying to him?
The EMG was clean.,"Well, based on this history it's either toxic herbs from the homeopath, spinal damage from the Parkropractor, infection from the needle that the acupuncturist accidentally let sit in eye of newt, or the Shen balancer.","Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff."
The only abnormal test result we found was on the echo report. Mitral valve prolapse.,"Hang up a shingle and condemn the narrowness and greed of Western medicine, you'd make a damn fine living.","Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?"
"Clot's formed on a faulty valve, gets sent to the brain, voila! Stroke.","Of course, no harm, no foul. It's just taking a few bucks from superstitious idiots, right?",So this is what a stroke feels like.
"Trauma? From what, the Parkropractic treatments? It's bacterial endocarditis, an infected valve. We should do blood cultures.",Except the six months that he had with these charlatans might have been spent going to someone who looks at things that exist in the real world.,"Well, you dont know the backstory."
"No, not necessarily.",Hmm.,"No, thats absolutely the case."
The guy obviously broke his jaw somehow. Who knows what other trauma he's suffered? We should do the angiogram again.,"And all signs point to! He looks at the 8-ball. Sorry, Chase. The gods have spoken. Start Harvey on blood thinners and antibiotics.",Volantis? Youre far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
That's just sick.,"Well, that's an intriguing legal opinion. Geez, what kind of a Lawyer is he?",That is the sickest thing Ive ever heard.
"I was careful. I watched the monitors, made sure his O2 stats were over 90. I would nEver hurt him.",Then what was the point?,I tried to keep Michael in the dark.
"We're not done here, we have to talk!","Call the cops, bar her from the hospital, force her to pierce your nipples! not really medical decisions.",Can we talk about it at the end of the day?
It was a weird scene. I observed House enters.,Chase. Did you know about this Woman? What she does?,Oh really? camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
"I met her at some parties, yeah.",I wouldn't have tortured you if I knew you liked it.,"Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?"
I said I thought it was a trauma induced aneurysm.,"Yeah, could have carried a tad more weight if you'd mentioned the liking pain thing. You're on my naughty list. Sorry, no leather stethoscope this Christmas.",Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
I'm not into,I assume you nEver started him on antibiotics or blood thinners before Mistress Ilsa's rude interruption.,You could be a little more into it.
It was pRobably a good thing.,Start him on antibiotics and blood thinners. House watches as an older gentleMan walks into his office. He watches the Man throughout the rest of this scene.,"Now I know its been awhile, but I took it as a good sign."
You still think Chase is wrong?,"No, he's pRobably right.",He was in the right of course.
"If we put him on blood thinners, he might bleed out.","But if Foreman's right about it being bacterial endocarditis, and we Foreman raises his hand.","Boy, I want to tell you its her loss, but you are not making it easy."
I think Chase is right.,"Okay, if Foreman used to be right about it being blood clots, and we take the surgery route, then we'll pRobably kill the guy.","Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
You Dr. House?,"I have a feeling I'm going to regret this, but yes.","No, its not that bad."
"Ramona said I should come to you for my refill. He holds up a pill bottle. Uh, with, for the beginning to droop? He demonstrates with his finger. House takes the bottle. She said you'd pRobably want to talk to me first.",She lied. He hands Myron a script. Here you go.,"The Hall Outside Lydias Room, Joey is walking up to Lydias room with balloons, but before he enters he sees that the babys father has arrived."
Here you go. Thanks.,Always happy to make people happy. Goodbye.,"At once, Your Grace."
I I don't know how much more of this I can take.,How much more of what?,IVE HAD ENOUGH!
How much more of what? whispers Sex.,You don't want more sex?,"Its just a little bit more, honey."
My golf swing is all messed up.,"Hey, here's a radical thought. Talk to her.","If I may, try holding the putter."
Talk to her. The truth?,Sounds crazy when you put it like that.,Why dont you just be straight with her?
"Oh, Ramona's got a big appetite. If I don't perform, I don't want to lose her. He sighs. You got a pharmacy around here?",In the hospital? Could be. Let's see if we can find it.,"Please, please, I dont have a lot of time."
In the hospital? Could be. Let's see if we can find it.,Got any blue pills?,I dont know!
raising his eyebrows You looking for ED medication?,"Well, that's one example of a blue pill. Name six others.","Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?"
There's a brand of acetaminophen out!,Perfect. Fill her up. House nods to Myron. Cuddy walks up.,"Hey Jim, heres the aspirin you wanted."
Cuddy walks up. Dr. House.,Little busy here.,Pennys apartment door.
I heard about Dr. Cameron's conditions for coming back to work.,It's purely business. I'll make sure you get the recipt.,He can have his job back.
"Well, I think it's a good thing. What happened in your last relationship, it's no reason to wall yourself from people forEver. 5 years of self-pity is pRobably enough.","Wow. Well, you've certainly given me a lot to think about. If only I was as open as you.",Ive been told its a good way to move on.
If only I was as open as you. Well,"Actually, it was your blouse I was talking about. Cuddy smiles.","Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind."
Weakness in his right arm and hand. Harvey's having mini-strokes the blood thinners aren't making a difference.,"Stop the treatment. to Foreman Sorry, we tried your way, you could not have been wronger.",Youd hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension.
I said Chase was pRobably right.,"Oh yeah, we've all got perfect 20-20 hindsight.","How about that, you were right."
About tomorrow night.,You couldn't keep your mouth shut.,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
I didn't see any reason to. Where are we going? I want to make sure I dress appropriately.,That would be army boots and t-shirt. It's the county paintball tourney. First prize is fifty bucks I'll split it with you if you hold your end up.,"Oh, sure. Really didnt give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? Hehwoh you."
I'm not sure if that was the deal.,Relax. I made a reservation at Caf Spiletto. Regarding wardRobe are you too young to remember spandex?,"Well, I guess it was too good to be true."
"I already did. Mashed them up in his applesauce, it'll lighten him up soon enough.",Someone should just tell him to do it. Way faster.,"Well if hes not gonna eat it, I will."
And I already tried.,Not you. Where's a good dominatrix when you need one?,And youre not gonna do that.
Annette's barred from the hospital.,"If you get caught, Cuddy's got a hairbrush. And beliEve me, she knows how to use it.",It appears the queen mother doesnt wish to attend her own trial.
"So, what's that, two strokes you've scared this guy into?",Yeah. It's making me question my view of myself as a people person.,"Well, Im sorry, but that is your second strike."
He said no. We can't do it.,"Emergent situation, invoke heroic measures.","He says, No."
You need a court order.,"Great, where do I get me one of them? Do I need to Lawyer up?",Youre both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
I'll need to show the Judge an affidavit from next of kin.,"Well, they might have a pRoblem signing anything seeing as how they're dead.","Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out."
He'll want proof.,"Like what, dad's hand? I don't Even know where they're buried.","Hopefully, he wont be too upset."
"They guy lives in Market Town. I don't know if he grew there, but we could check the local funeral home.","Great, and when your searches turn up nothing you should try to find out where they live.","Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate."
He said they were dead.,"Accountants, they're usually pretty good with money, so how come he lives in a slum like Market Town?",You dont think hell ask us how they died?
Maybe they were bad accountants.,Two bad accountants from the Pacific Rim? The odds are astronomical.,Its clearly not an accounting mistake.
Or maybe they cut him off when they found out about his proclivities.,"That'd be my bet. Go to his apartments. See if you can find his folks. Address, number, something. House walks into his office. Foreman follows him.","Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?"
"Hey, can I talk to you?",Sure.,Hey. Do you want to talk?
"Look, Cameron's a friend. This whole dating thing",turns on the TV Time's up. Thanks for playing.,"I know, but he was my friend first."
"Hey, I've been on the scene more than you recently.",Way ahead of you.,Youre here a lot now.
"Come on, you're not into her. Most guys who aren't interested in a Woman try to sugarcoat it, be nice.","Oh, you know me too well.","Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasnt interested?"
That's what I'm saying. I think you should go with your instincts here. Be a jerk.,I'm missing my soap for this?,"Oh, thats fine!"
"Women love to be right. You've got to leave them feeling superior. Like they've dodged a bullet. If you're nice, she'll blame herself",And fall for me Even more.,Women are mean!
I didn't get a chance. Call back.,I'll do it.,"Yeah, Ill call you back."
They're gonna show up at the morgue.,Be sure to let me know when Cuddy starts screaming. Chase takes the second mint box from his pocket and eats a few more.,"They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next."
He told us our son was dead.,"It's only a white lie. Technically, all I did was call them a little early. Trust me, he'll be dead real soon. Actually, I saved you some rush hour traffic.","Hes dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that."
I'm calling our Lawyer.,Fine. Just as soon as you sign this surgery consent. I have a pen. Mrs. Park takes out her cell phone and dials.,"You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer."
He humiliated us. Everybody we know knows about his perversion.,But you don't get off on embarrassment the way your son does. I guess it skips a generation.,Hell know that we looked at his private notebook.
How much money would it take to compensate you,"Yeah, you guys can haggle in a minute.",How would you like to pay?
The wide side's too short. You're gonna look like Lou Costello.,This is a mistake.,You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
"Open doors for her, help her with her chair",I have been on a date.,Pull her up.
"Uh, not since disco died. Comment on her shoes, her earrings, and then move on to D.H.A. Her dreams, hopes and aspirations. Trust me. Panty-peeler. Oh, and if you need condoms, I've got some.",Did your wife give them to you?,"Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones."
"Drug rep. They've got antibiotics built in, somehow.",I should cancel. I've got a Patient in surgery tomorrow. House moves to the kitchen.,"In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo infections, mo money."
"And if you were a surgeon, that would actually matter. That's a good idea, settle your nerves. Get me a beer, too.",looking in the fridge No beer.,"Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, hows everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?"
You're gonna eat before dinner? House reaches into the fridge and takes out a corsage. Wilson gets up to investigate.,"This is pretty lame, right? Wilson smiles.","HeyOoh! Whatswhats that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?"
putting on the corsage It's beautiful. And you look very handsome.,Thank you.,"Thats a lovely gown, my lady."
I've always loved this restaurant.,Yeah. It's changed a lot since the last time I was here. It used to be a strip joint. Cameron laughs. Nice earrings.,"I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant."
My mom's. Thank you.,Nice shoes. Comfortable?,Mine! Or I will help you not.
I'm not expecting you to be someone you're not.,"We're in a restaurant, we're dressed up, we're eating. If not small talk, what is there? Awkward pause of doom.",I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
"setting down the wine list According to Freud, and I'm paraphrasing, instinct of love toward an object deMands a mastery to obtain it, and if a person feels they can't control the object or feel threatened by it, they act negatively toward it. Like an eighth-grade boy punParkng a girl.","I treat you like garbage, so I must really like you. Given your Freudian theory, what does it mean if I start being nice to you?",When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male.
That you're getting in touch with your feelings.,Hmm. So there's absolutely nothing I can do to make you think that I don't like you.,"You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?"
"Sorry, no. I have one Evening with you, one chance, and I don't want to waste it talking about what wines you like or what movies you hate. I want to know how you feel about me.",You live under the delusion that you can fix Everything that isn't perfect.,Are you asking me on a date?
"It was fine, how was your Evening?","She had the ravioli, I had the puttanesca.",How was your night?
"Yes, I really want to know about the quality of the food. Either something very good happened, or something very bad. Which is it?","Well, I did have a little indigestion afterwards. Maybe it was the garlic bread.","ImIm sorry, its just that umm Well II cook at this restaurant, Alessandros, and umm I just got a really bad review"
"It was the wine. We had a nice, candid conversation.","Nothing deep, mostly small talk.","Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?"
"Nothing deep, mostly small talk. I'm sure.","Took your advice, complimented her shoes, that's fifteen minutes of chat right there.",What do you two talk about?
You two going to do dinner again?,I don't think so.,"Well, I was wondering if youd like to get dinner again sometime."
"Maybe we should go back to the blood thinners, up the dosage.","If it's not clots, a loading dose of blood thinners is gonna make him bleed out of his ears.",Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
This is important!,"Chase, Cameron, get another angiogram and echo.",Oh its important!
"Those pills you gave Myron, they're not working.","Well, glad to see you've got the correct perspective on the thing.","Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?"
"Well, the old ones, you know, made me feel like a tree!",Nice visual.,"Thats so much better than the old, ugly ones."
"The new ones, well, might as well be eating candy.",Candy wouldn't take away your headaches.,Come on! All the cool kids are eating em!
Candy wouldn't take away your headaches. What?,You came to me and told me that you were having too much sex.,Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
I nEver did!,"You too, Sequoia.",I did not!
"Well no, that's not true, I!","I know that Everybody lies, but you'd think that after a certain amount of time together you wouldn't be trying so hard.","Yeah. Hey, heres an idea, why dont we use our wedding china today?"
"What, well, why would they?","Well, style is one thing, but one silver, one gold? How long have you guys been married?",I dont know why they didnt just tell us.
simultaneously 55 years.,"Damn it, you're having an affair.","Ho, thirty years."
I just need a little rest.,"You guys aren't the victim of the little blue pill, you're the pRoblem!",Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
"Me, too. I should just have told you how I felt.",Aw.,"Me, too, but I guess now well never know."
"Hey, how 'bout the pills?",Looks like you guys are good to go drug-free for a while.,"Okay, while were waiting for these pills to kick in, Im gonna sit you down on the couch."
Looks like you guys are good to go drug-free for a while.,"Dr. Chase, these breath mints you've been popping since yesterday. Are they a new fetish?",As long as you guys dont need me up here.
"Oh, I got them at Harvey's. What, I just took two boxes the guy's got a whole drawer of them!",And you didn't find that interesting.,Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?
"Well, there's lots of interesting stuff at his place. The mints weren't high up on the list.",Wrong.,Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
The mints weren't high up on the list. Wrong.,"Chase, get your nose in here.",I carry mints with me sometimes.
"If you're trying to humiliate me, I told you","Come on, just put your face in his mouth. Chase does so, and then recoils.","Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?"
"Chase does so, and then recoils. Ugh.","Rich, wouldn't you say?",Chasing him all around the room?
Uh. Smells like old vomit.,Number one sign of fulminating osteomylitis.,It smells like throw up in here.
Infection of the jaw?,PRobably from the original break.,Is your tongue swelling up?
So how do we confirm?,Like this.,How do we decide that?
"Like this. He sticks a syringe in Harvey's jaw, pulling out pus from the infection. Ladies and gentlemen, we have pus. He hands the syringe to Chase, and takes the tic-tacs from him, eating a few. We're gonna remove the jaw. Anybody got a buzzsaw? Okay, call a surgeon.","Hi, I'm Dr. House. to the nurse How's tricks, Annette? The nurse turns, and it is indeed Annette in nurse's scrubs.","Okay!

He's not a freak.,"Yeah, he is. A little. But it's got to stop. Or he'll die.",You know who else was a freak?
"It's not about pain. It's about being open, being completely vulnerable to another person. If you can learn to be that deeply trusting! it changes you.","Well, lock him in a cage. That should be fine, medically.",God. Do think it really doesnt hurt? Cause how can they do that?
Dr. Riley is throwing up he obviously can't lecture,"You witnessed the spew, or you just have his word for it?",I found another tweet from a student at Sheldons lecture.
laughing Dr. Riley doesn't have a history of lying to me.,You said this is the fifth time he's missed a class this year! Either he's dying or he's lying.,"Oh. Oh yeah, dont get to worked up over it. I mean itit sounds like hes a doctor, but hes not."
I'll give you two hours off clinic duty.,"Fine, I'll have Cameron do it. She loves inspiring the inspired. He starts to walk off.","If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors."
You'll do it.,turning back Why is it always me?,"You gotta do it, man."
Because the world hates you. Or because it's a class on diagnostics. Pick whatEver reason feeds your narcissism better.,"I'm not doing it. He leaves, stops at the door, and walks back in. You're supposed to stop me. Renegotiate.",Cause its like taking your drivers test in a bus.
"Hmm, and you were supposed to keep on walking. Sorry, I guess we both screwed up. Go on, do it again.",I'll do the lecture for four hours off clinic.,"No, just keep walking."
"Dr. House, there's a Patient.","I'm outta here, take it up with Cuddy.","The delivery room, Ross has returned with another doctor."
"Gregg. House turns at the clinic doors to see! the infamous Stacy, waiting with a bunch of papers and x-ray films. She walks up to him House looks! well, it's hard to describe. Run over by a bus sounds good.","Hi, Stacy.","The hospital, Chandler has been rushed to the emergency room."
How're you doing?,"How am I doing? Well, the last five years have been like! you Ever see those Girls Gone Wild videos?",Thats not the kind of king I want to be.
"Your life's been like that, or your life's been spent watParkng them? They both kind of smile. I have missed you.",Is that why you're here? Stacy shakes her head.,"Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better."
I need your help. She hands him the films he limps over to the clinic desk to take a look.,Who am I looking at?,God! If youre gonna cry about it! She grabs the box and goes to through it out.
Who am I looking at? My husband.,Who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells.,Why do you keep looking at my husband?
Did you think I wasn't going to get married?,"Not to someone so poorly endowed. This guy's pancreas is pathetic. He walks off, Stacy follows.",No! I definitely dont wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didnt want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind theres gonna be hell to pay mister!
"There is no kidney stone, no indigestion. Three hospitals, five doctors, not one of them found anything.","Well, maybe there's nothing to be found.",Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
"Right, you suddenly trust doctors, love puppies and long walks in the rain.",The walks are out. Stacy grabs his arm.,But the doctor said if I cant find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings Im going to die.
"I was around you long enough to know when something's not right. Mark's had personality changes, he's acting strange, disconnected!",Interesting. It means there's either a neurological component or he's having an affair.,"I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?"
"No affair, no nothing! He's sick! I know you're not too busy you avoid work like the plague. Unless it actually is the plague. I'm asking you a favor.","I'm not too busy, but I'm not sure I want him to live. It's good seeing you again. He leaves, and Stacy is holding back tears.","Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity."
"I'm not too busy, but I'm not sure I want him to live. It's good seeing you again. He leaves, and Stacy is holding back tears.",Three guys walk into a clinic.,"Hi, this is Kevin."
Most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain. Apply heat and rest affected areas.,"Statistically, you're right.","Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp."
What were they doing when pain presented?,I have no idea. Enter the third student the Rebellious one.,I was in too much pain.
You didn't ask? You didn't take a history?,"Of course, but all that told us was what they said happened.",I dont need you to give me a history lesson.
"Whoa, you treated the Baywatch Parkck?",The Baywatch thespian.,"Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?"
"The Baywatch thespian. And no, I've gotta disguise the identity of each of the Patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged Man. Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative. Also, she's apparently quite the golfer. He stands. Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death. Any guesses on which is which? Silence. Okay, I say we start with the farmer.","Did you hike to the fence, and how far?",Angela as the nurse!
"Yes, it's about half a mile from my farmHouse.",And where's the pain localized?,Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.
It started just above my ankle and it's radiating up.,"So, what should we do first? He turns, and Keen Student is standing right next to him.",That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
"He turns, and Keen Student is standing right next to him. Family history?","Indicative of leg pain? That's a very short list. Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma? The farmer shakes his head. Caring Student pops up.","The Cooking Class, Joey is trying to cook as the teacher walks over to him."
"If the pRoblem's vascular, he's better off","Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing. Patient's dead. You killed him. The students look and sure enough, the farmer's dead on the table.",Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
We had no time to run any tests there was nothing we could do!,You had time to look at the leg.,"Was its heart beating, Toby?"
I thought we were starting with the farmer's case first.,We are. But if we're going to look at a leg!,Alleged? Im going to own your farm by the time this is over.
We are. But if we're going to look at a leg!,I need you to take off your pants.,Your thinking about my leg arent you?
"House looks at the wound, and then looks out as he proclaims -- Puncture. Snakebite.",That would be my guess.,"Im a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention."
Farmer didn't know he had been bit by a snake?,"That's what he said. Sudden shooting pain, tall grass, nEver saw a thing.",Why didnt he turn into a snake?
What kind of snake?,You want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?,"If Im gonna be an old, lonely man, Im gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face."
How are we supposed to know what kind of antivenin to use if we don't know what kind of snake it is?,"Oh, there are people to find those things out.",Thats why its guarded by snakes.
"The guy might only have a couple of hours. They open the gate, but close it again as a dog comes up barking at them.","And while we wait for the HuMane Society to show up, what say we check up on the volleyball player?",See? This is what happens. You cant let a stray dog into the house.
"How old is this person? I mean, it's not really a 40-year-old Man on a girls' volleyball team, right?",It's a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.,Him? Hes got to be 60 years old.
"Well, I was just worried that",Would you worry about her more if she was younger?,You were worried about that?
Obviously we should care about our Patients no matter what age,"Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen. She's mine, stay away. Chuckles from the class. Would you operate on your mother?","Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?"
Of course not. I'd be too nervous couldn't be objective.,Then why are you so anxious to treat Every Patient like they're family? The actual Patient is 16. Here's what happens when doctors care to much.,"Umm, no, not at first cause II dont want to freak him out"
"I went back three generations no history of cancer, Parkinson's, or any other degenerative condition. But there's this boy at school, and he's on the boys' volleyball team, and they made out at a party, and now he won't call her back, and this friend of hers at school said this boy didn't like her and nEver did.",You got all this from an examination of the knee?,"You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and theres nothing you can do about it."
I think she's depressed.,She doesn't have tendoni,I think shes lonely.
She has tendonitis.,She's depressed about having tendonitis.,"So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?"
She's depressed for the same reason she has tendonitis.,Not the boy.,Hes depressed because hes pathetic and creepy and he cant get girls.
"No, the boy's a jerk, she knows that, and yet she's depressed. I found a nodule.","Ah. PRoblems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons.",My moms been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
"So, because she took such an extreme interest, she found out the person had a thyroid condition.","No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule.","All right, well, if Im understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, Im thinking you might have to let this one go."
"No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule. Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.",Here's how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.,Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?
Can I put my pants back on now?,I'd rather you didn't. Caring Student shows up.,"No, II got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from thethe sweat ororor my legs expanded from the heat."
Which Carmen Electra is this?,First one. The golfer. Enter Keen Student.,Which one is she?
"Then why isn't she wearing pants? House gives him a look. Like, duh!",to Carmen You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon. Anyone? Rebellious Student has shown up.,"So Phoebe, why are there mens shoes by the door."
Rebellious Student has shown up. Slipped disc?,Could be. How bad does it hurt?,Also and no pressure the teacher?
"deadpan It hurts really, really bad.",Yeah?,It stings a lot.
It doesn't seem real. Is she the one faking?,"Oh, for God's sake.",Shes very real.
Or it could be referred pain from his groin.,"Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else? The last part is almost drowned out.",Okay wait its youre saying it comes from the foot.
He's curling it's not the back.,"Sir, where are you getting pain?","Im not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesnt look good."
"Sir, where are you getting pain? Help me!",Oooh.,Youre in pain.
"We have no history, he could be allergic.",holding up the syringe What do I do?,I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
"Better than killing him with pain killers, then While she is speaking, the Man grabs the syringe from House and sticks it in his leg.","Apparently, he's not allergic.","Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldnt talk to her."
We screwed up.,"No, you did exactly what his attending did.","Listen, we did a stupid thing."
And that was the proper way to handle the case?,Yeah.,You threatened to sue?
The guy used him as a dealer!,"You're going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there's a reason it works. Meanwhile, back on the farm!","Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin."
It's not going to stay that way. The monitors start to beep. Paddles!,"What say we take five? Get some coffee, go pee. He leaves.","Hang on, the sensors picking up something, turn your head back."
You didn't think she was going to get married?,She asked me the same question.,Well did she know you two werent married?
And! what? You're not gonna treat him?,There's pRobably nothing wrong with him.,I wont hurt him.
"Oh, sure, that makes sense. She's just using the old sick husband routine as an excuse to get back in touch with you. You think this is easy for her? The only reason she'd be anywhere near you was if she was desperate.",So I should help her because she hates me.,She still has feelings for you.
It's been almost six minutes. Found him.,The volleyball player was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you'd expect in a case of tendonitis.,"Hey, where is this guy, its been over an hour!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy? I don't really care about the volleyball player.",What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?,"That guy, he burns me up."
What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke? Really?,"No. But that would make you interested, right? What if her T4 came back low? It's not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true.","Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?"
You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.,"No, I didn't. I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test. Apparently the Patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition.","The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about his first night with Carol."
"So, that's it?","You were right the first time. Snakebite guy's way more interesting. Gross, actually.","You know what, thats it, thats it."
He faxed us the venom tests which confirmed it's a timber rattlesnake.,"looking at the tests No, it's not. Notice the volume?","Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter?"
I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring and skipped right to the name of the snake.,200mg. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago. There's no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.,"Unless You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth!"
We're supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?,Nope. Unless you've got a Patient bit by one. Then it might be helpful. So what do we do now?,"When the serpent slithers to an opposing players piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves."
He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.,"Or you go online and find there's only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral.","Wrong. Hes not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what its all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose."
So we give him the antivenin for the other one.,Is that a question?,And now we have two.
"Well, we can't just blindly give him another antivenin. Especially after the first one almost killed him. You said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in New Jersey. But what if this is an uncommon one?",Very good.,"You dont live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby."
We've gotta find the right snake.,"No need. Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was.",Stand down. Everybody stand down! Im the leader of these people and Im unarmed. Theres no need for any more snakemakery.
So we do give him the antivenin for the other one.,"Again, was that a question?",Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
I assume that one choice kills him and one saves him.,That's usually the way it works at the leg turning black stage.,"Well, just you know, for arguments sake, you know, hypothetically."
So half of us killed him and half of us saved his life.,Yeah.,Each of you is doing half a job.
But we can't be blamed for,"I'm sure this goes against Everything you've been taught, but right and wrong do exist.",We really do feel bad about this though.
"I'm sure this goes against Everything you've been taught, but right and wrong do exist. Just because you don't know what the right answer is maybe there's Even no way you could know what the right answer is doesn't make your answer right or Even okay. It's much simpler than that. It's just plain wrong.",voiceovers We gave the guy the antivenin.,"Well, when its not right, you know it."
He came back?,"taking some Vicodin On average, drug addicts are stupid.","He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
I'd call the cops.,Good for you. A lot of doctors wouldn't risk their careers on a hunch.,"Yeah, maybe you should call the police."
"It's not a hunch, I mean, I know he wants drugs.",I beliEve drug addicts get sick.,"No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?"
But you already know he has drugs in his system.,That's not what I'm testing for.,"Hes a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go?"
That's not what I'm testing for.,"We're going to put this hard, rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder. It might be a little uncomfortable.","I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly."
Shouldn't I be getting some kind of anesthetic? He groans as the nurse does her job.,We're concerned about allergic reactions today.,Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
We're concerned about allergic reactions today.,"If the guy can handle a rod in his penis for half an hour, he's really sick.",Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Or he's really jonesing.,There's easier ways to get a hold of drugs.,Or maybe hes just stuck in character.
A little. Not really!,"filling the mug Well, if you can't hear me, how do you know what I asked?","Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa."
"I promise to be very careful. She gets ready to insert the needle, and the player flinches and yells as soon as the needle touches her skin. Susan!",Not her real name!,She stuck a needle into my hand!
Lab over 16.,The question is why. Likely suspects?,Im sorry. 16?
Whoa whoa whoa. Can you please slow down? House takes a sip of water from the mug and spits it out.,slowly The adenoma is most likely. Check her PTH,"Good, this is good."
slowly The adenoma is most likely. Check her PTH,"-- phosphorus, and ionized calcium, and do a technetium sestamibi. Okay, that's enough about the volleyball player. What's up with the farmer? They all look at him.","Im not going north, child, were going home."
They all look at him. What farmer?,Snakebite guy.,Must have been the farmers boys.
His condition's not improving double the dosage. Already did.,"There's another antivenin, it's not as effective, but","Unfortunately, we werent able to convince him to go to rehab."
Already tried it.,"The first stuff, the stuff he was allergic to",I did and it worked.
Gave it to him with high-dose steroids. Nothing's working.,to the camera What does it all mean?,Ross IWe tried all the spicy food.
to the camera What does it all mean? Wrong snake?,We tried Every other antivenin we had.,"Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, cause that was a lousy anniversary present."
We're too late?,"Yep. He's dying. His wife's here, finally found a babysitter. Who wants to let him know? Actually, I'm kidding.","Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?"
He's not dying?,"Oh, yeah, he's dying, but there's no wife and kid. Which is great. Makes the breaking the news thing way easier. Oh, yeah, one more piece of news.",Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
"Oh, yeah, he's dying, but there's no wife and kid. Which is great. Makes the breaking the news thing way easier. Oh, yeah, one more piece of news.",The drug addict is peeing blood.,"Hes gonna die alone, right?"
The drug addict is peeing blood.,How do they teach you how to tell someone that they're dying?,"No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I dont! Thats, thats... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me."
"Yeah, one of us gives the bad news and one of us gets the bad news.",And what do you have to do to get an A in You're Dying 101?,Hey you guys I got some bad news.
"And what do you have to do to get an A in You're Dying 101? They grade you on gentleness and supportiveness? Is there a scale for measuring compassion? This buddy of mine, I gotta give him ten bucks Every time somebody says Thank you. Imagine that. This guy's so good, people thank him for telling them that they're dying. He looks at his picture. Eh, needs brown. I don't get thanked that often.",You're dying. In a few hours. There's nothing we can do except deal with the pain.,So how does it feel knowing youre about to die?
"Well, I need to go home.",You're not going home.,"No. No, I gotta go home sometime."
"Wait, wait, wait. The guy's dying and all he cares about is his dog?",Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions?,"Hey, the mans dog just died."
Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions? It's a basic truth of the huMan condition that Everybody lies. The only variable is about what. The weird thing about telling someone they're dying is it tends to focus their priorities. You find out what matters to them. What they're willing to die for. What they're willing to lie for.,"Well, you must have a neighbor who","I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go."
The neighbors don't like him.,Then the HuMane Society can take him in and,What if he lives in your garage?
"No, they won't. Maybe my aunt","It wasn't a snakebite, was it?","No, they wont."
I said I don't remember being bit.,Sure you do.,"Nope, I wasnt bitten."
"I got his head, just do it!","What would you call that? That's tea-colored, right? The guy who we thought was just after the drugs! what's the differential diagnosis for urine that's tea-colored?",All right! Yknow what? Thats it! You wanna do it?! Lets do it!
what's the differential diagnosis for urine that's tea-colored? Kidney stone.,Kidney stones would cause what?,A cup could find its way under the urine.
Blood in urine.,What color is your pee?,"Blood, urine, or semen."
What color is your pee? Yellow.,What color is your blood?,Cant you see Im urinating?
What color is your blood? Red.,What colors did I use?,Whats your blood type?
"Red, yellow and brown.",And brown. What causes brown?,"Well, theres green, um, blue."
What causes brown? Wastes.,Which means the kidneys are shutting down. Why?,Whoa. What are those stains?
Why? Trauma.,None that his history would indiCate.,It must have been traumatic for you.
Could be damage done by the self-injection of the Demerol.,Treatment?,Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
Heat and rest,Other possible causes.,Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest.
Other possible causes. Infection.,"Start him on antibiotics. What else? She pauses. Come on, come on!",Why are you making this so difficult?
I I don't know.,"You're useless. But at least you know it. Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase, what does that tell you?",Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?
"The trauma diagnosis is right. He takes it easy for a few days, he'll be fine.",You sure?,Im not cr uhh!
The elevated CK rules out infection,You know what's worse than useless? Useless and oblivious. He goes to the Keen student. What are they missing?,"Oh honey, Ill say goodbye to you at the car if you dont mind the puss."
"You know, it's kind of hard to think when you're in our face like this",Yeah? You think it's going to be easier when you've got a real Patient really dying? to Everyone What are you missing?,"Well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
from the doorway Muscle death.,Not your case.,From a bullet!
Dying muscle leaks myoglobin. It's toxic to the kidneys.,"Brilliant. MRI his leg, see what's killing it.",Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Why is the girl getting the MRI?,Because the neck scan rEvealed nothing and her doctor's way more obsessive than she thinks she is.,Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
But you said the guy needed the MRI.,Because Dr.,"Oh, I thought you said he was okay."
Did he get better?,No.,Hows Howard holding up?
"Well, how long",Three days.,About 2 months
Three days before they thought it might have been muscle death?,"No, three days before the Patient suggested it might have been muscle death.","Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
We may need to remove the leg.,"His MRI showed that the leg pain wasn't caused by the self-injection, wasn't caused by an infection. It was an aneurysm that clotted, leading to an infarction.",Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.
We have to do the surgery. The necrotic tissue has to be removed. If there's too much,I don't care what you find.,Im sure everything will be fine.
It may become necessary in order to save your life.,I like my leg. I've had it for as long as I can remember.,Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
"Honey, I love your leg as much as you do.",They're not cutting it off.,"Aw, honey, thats so sweet."
They're not cutting it off.,Patient made the right choice. Tell a surgeon it's okay to cut a leg off and he's going to spend the night polishing his good hacksaw.,Because soap is soap.
"Right, surgeons could care less about saving limbs.","Well, of course they care about their Patients.","Better at amputations, Im afraid."
Amazing advances have been made. Kids with prosthetic legs are running the 100-meter dash in twelve seconds.,"Yeah, they're just not as pretty. Do a bypass, restore the circulation.","I dont care about prosthetics, this is insane!"
Amputation is safer.,"For you, or me?",Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
The blockage of blood flow,Four-day blockage.,"You dont, but the surgeon might, hmm?"
"Yes. It caused muscle cell death. When those cells die, they release cytokines and potassium --","If you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off, then all that crap gets washed back into my system.","No, its true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
The post-operative pain alone,"I'll get through it. I understand the risks, you're in the clear. Go schedule an OR. Cuddy leaves.","Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine."
"God, you're an idiot.",I think I'm more of a jerk.,You are an idiot.
"I'm not being glib. And I'm not being cute, I don't want you to kill yourself.",I'm not gonna die.,"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"
"Oh, I feel completely reassured.",I think they gotta up that morphine.,"Yeah, thats very comforting."
The doctors say they can't.,The doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.,"Nope, they cannot."
"They screwed up, it doesn't mean they're wrong this time.",Sure doesn't mean they're right.,"Cmon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity."
Morphine will kill you.,I can handle it.,Youll wish it would kill you.
"You're in pain, you're not thinking right.",That's why I need the damn morphine!,"Alright Ross, look."
He's not big on middle ground. Yeah.,Nurse? Nurse! I need more calcium gluconate.,Um. He sticks to his guns.
You just had 5 mLs.,The QRS is getting wider. My potassium is rising.,"Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, Id be glad to play you for it."
I'll talk to your doctor.,"Well, you better make it fast, 'cause I'm about to go into cardiac arrest. You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia.",Youll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these and call me in the morning.
I could get in trouble,"Listen, it's not a narcotic!",Im in big trouble.
"Clear! They shock him, and he flatlines.",The Patient was technically dead for over a minute.,And when he falls?
standing in the back Do you think he was dead? Do you think those experiences were real?,Define real.,He was dead the whole time.
You choose to beliEve that?,"There's no conclusive science. My choice has no practical relevance to my life, I choose the outcome I find more comforting.",We came over as soon as we saw.
You find it more comforting to beliEve that this is it?,I find it more comforting to beliEve that this isn't simply a test.,"Really? That, thats it? Thats comforting?"
How bad is the pain right now?,It's bad.,"Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?"
"It's not getting any better. If you were right, the pain would be subsiding. You'd be getting better.",It's just taking longer.,"I know it hurts now, but its gonna get better."
"No, it's not. We've got to let him cut the leg off.",It's my leg. It's my life.,No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
Would you give up your leg to save my life?,Of course I would.,Why would you risk your life for me?
"Then why do you think your life is worth less than mine? If this were any other Patient, what would you tell them to do?",I would say it's their choice.,"OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease thats already been cured."
Wha not a chance! You'd browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right. You'd shove it in their face that it's just a damn leg! You don't think you deserve to live? You don't think you deserve to be happy? Not let them cut off your leg? They're both near tears.,"I can't, I can't, I'm sorry.",What if every person in front of us let someone cut?
The pain alone is going to kill you.,"I know, I know. I need you to talk to the doctor.",Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over.
You'll be out in less than a minute.,Thank you. to Stacy Hey.,"Youre out too, by the way."
to Stacy Hey. Hey.,I'll see you when I wake up. We'll go golfing. I love you.,Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
"I love you, too. I'm sorry.",going under You've got nothing to be sorry about. Stacy gets up and walks over to Cuddy.,"Right, fine, Ill do it, but no talking."
He won't see it that way.,"Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the Patient's leg was sEverely compromised.","No, hed just take it the wrong way."
The Patient's an idiot.,half-laugh They usually are. Do you have a buzzer or something. What time does this class end?,So much of this is just impossible to verify.
at the doorway Twenty minutes ago.,I'm not doing this again.,At the apartment door.
"I'm not doing this again. picking up the World's greatest dad mug and walking toward Cuddy And this guy is not the world's greatest dad. Not Even ranked. Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint? That's why he's always sick. Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again. He leaves, leaving behind a full room of shellshocked students.","Stacy, it's Gregg. I've got an opening for ten tomorrow morning. Make sure your husband isn't late. He hangs up, and enters his office.","Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym Oooh, my rock polisher!"
"Stacy, it's Gregg. I've got an opening for ten tomorrow morning. Make sure your husband isn't late. He hangs up, and enters his office.",I gotta go.,"So, we had a personnel change today."
"No, no, he'll be here. I'm sure he's just running a little late.","He's cancelled two exams, he's not gonna",Hes not here yet.
He's scared of you.,"Sure. The ex-boy-toy. Eh, that makes sense.",Cause hes scared of you?
He wasn't scared before.,"Right, you think being afraid of me is a symptom of a serious ailment.","Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know?"
"Sudden mood swings, infantile regression, abdominal pain, he's passed out twice, yeah! I think it might be a medical pRoblem.",He's twenty minutes late. I'm outta here.,He has a nervous bladder when hes stressed out.
Please. She puts her hand on his. He'll be here.,Why? Because he loves you and does Everything he's told?,"She says, sure, what about him?"
Because I didn't tell him you'd be here. She gives him a Ha! kind of look. House fixes the necklace Stacy's wearing a silver crucifix.,He likes to see.,"Because, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married."
"Hey about to make introductions, but --",Hi. I'm Gregg House. You must be Matt.,Oh! Why dont you introduce me?
Hi. Wow. Gregg House.,Yeah. Wow.,Wil Wheatons house.
"No, I haven't been avoiding you, I just didn't want to waste your time. The other doctors checked me out and they said it was just stress. College season, kids, parents, they're all over me.",Makes sense to me.,"Well, Ive been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong."
Makes sense to me. Gregg,What do you want me to do?,It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
You said you'd check him out!,He says he's healthy. What's to check out?,I told you about him.
"Sorry for the mix-up, but I'm glad you two got a chance to catch up. Looks like you're having fun.","Oh, he's good. If you can fake sincerity, you can fake pretty much anything. I can't tell you how much I like your fella.","Oh, no. Im so glad were hanging out again outside of work."
"Yeah, me too. You know, I thought you'd be all sarcastic, bitter, you know, because Stacy married me. He puts an arm around Stacy to emphasize the fact.","You know, we should do things together. Maybe throw a ball around or something. Guy stuff.","Oh! Yeah, yknow you and Ross are still married."
We could go for a run together.,Hah! He's Oscar Wilde!,"Okay, lets go running!"
"Wow, this pissing contest is really turning me on. He needs to go to the hospital.","raising his glass Here's to women. You can't live with 'em, you can't kill 'em until the neighbors are stripping in Atlantic City.","Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, Id lock Mose in the chicken coop."
raising his own glass Damn straight. They start to drink! and House finishes his glass first.,I'm definitely taller.,Ross and Rachels kitchen.
entering the restaurant with a gurney Someone call 911 for a wagon to Princeton-Plainsboro?,Garon!,"Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?"
You dosed him!,"I told you, I'd check him out.",You woke him.
I know. You made milk come out of my nose. House enters.,Morning. You guys got the file? What's wrong?,"Well, youre pushing the milk out, right?"
Previous tests rEvealed nothing that would cause abdominal pain or the mood swings.,"Then we're done! What do you think, ball game, zoo? I don't care, I just want to hang with you guys.","I dont care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam."
What about drugs? His tox screen on admission showed a massive amount of chloral hydrate.,"Yeah, sorry, that was me. I had to dope him up to get him in here. Guy doesn't think he's sick.","He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine wed be floating around in, he didnt even question it."
Guy doesn't think he's sick. Who does?,His wife.,"Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? Cause that guy couldnt get sick, just like me."
The Woman you used to live with.,That's her Indian name. On her driver's license it's Stacy. I assume you have a point.,The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
You beliEve her over the Patient himself. That's why we're taking this case.,"The truth, I hear voices. All the time. Telling me to do stuff, it's crazy, huh?",Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
What happened to Everybody lies?,I was lying.,"No, they stopped making that show."
heading to his office Did I miss anything? Kitchen sink?,"Well, we could certainly give that a oh, you minx.",Are you going to the office?
"What you're thinking is, you're going to save him, be a hero, and win her back. It's always impressive, that lEvel of twisted narcissism.",She's married. Big clue I lost the game.,Tell him what you did to her.
You can't be within fifty feet of Stacy Warner.,I thought she wanted me to treat him.,"Okay, now would you say that thats more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?"
Treat the husband. Stay away from the wife.,But what if they get close to each other? What do I do then?,"But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone."
"Hey, you have to treat this like a regular case. House gets into the elevator. Be yourself cold, uncaring, distant.","Please, don't put me on a pedestal.","Dwight called my house, but he didnt realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I I cant stay out of her stuff."
"MRAs were clean, which means he's pRobably fine. He doesn't seem paranoid, he shows no signs of","No, it means we have no idea what's wrong with him. Foreman walks up.","I got to tell you, Im a little worried about him."
Ben Goldstein says the schedule's locked. He can't do it before tomorrow.,"No, today. Call him. Tell him I'll make it work.","You know, Im not sure, the manager hasnt posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know."
as Foreman walks off again You're cutting him open?,"to Foreman Whoa, hold it! There's no need for exploratory surgery, Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis.","And cut. All right. All right, lets set up for the next scene."
"No, I just think it's premature and maybe irresponsible to do exploratory surgery before we know he's actually sick.","No, it's premature to put him on a list for hospice care.","Yes, its a highly controversial procedure."
All we have is his wife,Who says that his stomach hurts. Works for me.,Youre his wife now.
The Patient doesn't Even think he's sick. Why would he consent,"His wife's a Lawyer. She's very convincing. Call Goldstein, surgery's on. House walks off, then Chase and Foreman, leaving Cameron standing in the hall with her mouth hanging open.",Which is exactly how youd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
"Leslie vs. Leslie seems to be right in point, but I'm sure they're going to try to distinguish it by she pauses as something is said over the overhead speaker sorry, they'll try to distinguish it by relying on the minority opinion. A paper coffee cup is thrust under her nose, held by one Dr. House.","Double milk, no sugar.","Carols OB/GYN, theyre still arguing about what to name the baby."
I like sugar now. House sits next to Stacy. They both look bored and somewhat anxious. House keeps tapping his cane on the floor. Some people would be annoyed by that. House taps on the floor a few more times.,You know why people sit in waiting rooms?,Chandler and Monicas new house.
This is gonna be good.,"People think the closer they're sitting to the operating room, the more they care.","God, this is going to be bad."
That's why I'm here. I'm not moving until Everybody sees me.,Are you doing anybody besides Mark? She looks at him. It's a medical question.,"Yeah. So dont move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night."
"Because if I am his paranoia isn't paranoia, it's a justified response? Therefore, not a legitimate symptom?",Knew you'd understand.,"Well, youre not totally paranoid."
"Mrs. Warner. The surgery went well he's in recovery, you can see him now. She leaves House stands. Quietly to House -- Goldstein found nothing but a distended bladder.",Neurogenic bladder isn't causing the pain.,"Lets go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder."
"Also doesn't cause personality changes. On the other hand, it would completely account for Cameron's diagnosis the Patient's completely healthy.",Give me the video for the surgery.,"Yeah, you said affected by it."
Give me the video for the surgery.,"Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation House.","I got the surgery, what else is there to do?"
"Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation House.","Well, don't Everybody talk at once. He pops a couple of Vicodin.","Cant wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now."
There's nothing there. House follows Cameron's eyes to what she's really looking at a empty bottle of whisky.,Stop looking at the suspiciously empty bottle and look at the screen.,Whats with all the bottles of liquor?
Means there's some sort of neurological pRoblem.,"A time bomb in his brain. I forget, who said it was nothing?",Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
Saw a very small diffuse abnormality in the brain waves. PRobably white matter. Means his axonal nerves are dying. Explains the neurogenic bladder.,"Enough nerves die, he dies.","Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. Were good to go."
Early onset Alzheimer's. The worst.,He won't die right away. He'll just want to.,"Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle."
We'll check his blood for Alzheimer's protein markers.,Last I heard Alzheimer's had a genetic component. Patient have parents?,"When Leonard gets back, Id love to check his serotonin levels."
checks the history Parents died in a car crash. No history of dementia.,"Send CSF or CBC and viral serologies to rule out encephalitis, and get Tal proteins to check for Alzheimer's. And this wielding the history still feels a little light.","You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
I took a complete medical history.,to Foreman Check out their House. Take SParky with you.,Is there anything else about your past I should know?
"They live in Short Hills, two hours away.",You can expense the tolls.,They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
You're not interested in the medical history. You're a Peeping Tom trying to spy on your ex.,to Foreman and Chase as they leave Her secret diary that's the main thing.,"I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying."
"Regularly used, could lead to neurotoxicity. Explains the axonal nerve damage and the personality issues. House picks up the bottle.","On the other hand, prescribed to W. Brown.",It does not say dangerous.
"Fake name, fake prescription.","Could be, but the prescribing doc, his name's real. This guy's just had his license pulled for writing illegal prescriptions to high school kids.","Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names."
Mark's a high school guidance counselor.,And Mr. Brown's birth date makes him 17-years-old. You think maybe these were confisCated by a high school guidance counselor? He pockets the bottle. Anything else?,"Yeah. So um, II heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today."
"Uh, yeah, he switched from mountain biking to yoga, could have been indication",He's getting older. What did the CSF say about encephalitis?,Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
"Said no. Champagne tap. No red cells, no white cells, serology's negative.",Which means we're back to Alzheimer's.,And no woos.
I told her he didn't have it. The marker tests were negative.,"Well, then you should have told her that.",She called it crazy?
"Yeah. First we're gonna map out some specific brain functions, check out the engine before we take the car for a drive. Foreman enters the room next to the maParkne, and finds House hiding in wait. Checking up on me?","I like all the pretty lights. The tech injects the chemical, and Mark starts to enter the maParkne.","Yeah. No. Im sorry, but somethings come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home."
Find a mailbox and mail it.,"Jeez, what a guy. His frontal lobe is working way better than mine. into the mike You remember when you got married?",Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm.
"Three years ago this July, who is that?",What? There could be a pRoblem with his long-term memory. in the mike Big church wedding?,"But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
Is that House?,He remembers voices.,Is this his house?
This serves no diagnostic purpose.,"I thought you skimped on the limbic system, there. Emotional reactions, I just want to be thorough. in the mike Did the atheistic bride wear a pretty, white dress?","The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content."
Was she thinking of you? Is that what you medically need to know?,What jewelry did your bride wear?,"So you knew she was okay, and you couldnt pick up the phone to tell us?"
"She nEver wears any jewelry. Except that cross her mother gave to her. No underwear, either. At least, not that day. I remember because she ripped her pretty, white dress off in the car. Is that the sort of answer you're looking for, Doctor?",I think I upset him.,"Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year."
I remember the Honeymoon was in Paris. I remember because we didn't leave the room for two weeks. You want the details on that?,A little defensive.,How was the honeymoon?
It's not paranoia if someone's out to get you.,Here we go. Stacy shoves him.,"Paranoid? Im not familiar with the word. And I really dont have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22yearold is trying to take my job."
"He's sick, paranoid, and you keep hammering him about me?",The questions were designed to define the operational parameters of his limbic system,"Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, hes really been making a fuss over me."
"Elevate the words all you want, you were just screwing with him. Low Even by your standards.",Medical screwing. It's what I do.,So you set him up.
And then you run away like a 12-year-old. Go hide on the roof like you always do.,I haven't been up here in five years.,Head towards the exits.
"It nEver occurred to me that you couldn't figure out what's wrong. Stacy starts to cry, and House walks over to hug her.",I haven't given up.,"Ross and Rachels, Emma continues to cry."
So what do we do?,We wait.,What do we do now?
We wait. For what?,"Something to change. It's one of the great tragEdies of life, something always they break apart, something always changes.","Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?"
"CGI cam goes into Mark's eye, and through neural passages that seem to short out at the end. What's happening?",Time marches on. He's paralyzed.,So youve been shown a nonsensical video.
"But he's experiencing significant paresthesias, and he can't move his hands or toes.","It's peripheral. Guillain-Barre syndrome attacks there, not the brain.","Oh, Im sure hes fine."
"No, no. I already did an indirect Coombs' test. No glutination, no antibodies!",Initiative! Like that. Start him on IV immunosuppress,"Not important. Your sugar was a little high. Id follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over."
"No antibodies means he doesn't have Guillain-Barre, period!",Period? More like dot dot dot. What if he has the virus but isn't producing those antibodies?,I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.
"Come on, the chances of that are","I didn't ask about the Vegas line, I said what if?",But youre saying theres a chance.
So we either fight it for him or it's fatal.,Fatal sounds very bad to me.,"At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person."
But without the antibodies we can't Even test for it. We don't know if we're right.,"The treatment isn't all that dangerous, plasmapheresis and IVIG. If it works, we're right. If he dies, it was something else.","Yknow, its funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases"
"Mark, what you're feeling, it's not real. It's the virus. Mark starts to choke Cameron looks into his mouth with her penlight. Mark? His throat's closing up, he can't breathe. Code blue! Nurses rush in. He's having a reaction to the IVIG, I need epi stat! She tries to tube him but he keeps jerking around. I can't get the scope in his throat!",Stop that.,"One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, Im dying on the gurney."
He's having an allergic reaction and he's crashing!,"No, he's not.","Hes tired, thats all."
You couldn't just walk into the room?,He's had five visitors drive down.,See how I did that.
"Shockingly, Mark has friends, and I have some new ones.","No, it's not shocking that you have new friends. But it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones.","Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and thats Ross."
But it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones. I haven't.,"No, I didn't think so.",Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
I've been busy! I haven't kept track of who knows what.,"See, my old friends are telling me to be careful. They seem to think","Hey, what have you guys been up too?"
He. And he sent me the bear.,Figures.,He sent you.
What's your point? That I'm still in love with you? I should abandon my dying husband and we should head for Rio?,No.,Look youre my wife.
She walks off. What's up?,"Love the bear, it was adorable.","Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave."
"My wife's going to kill me. We're having company, she cooked.","I got Mark's latest blood work, he's not responding to treatment.","Oh gosh, shes going to kill me."
"I got Mark's latest blood work, he's not responding to treatment. I'm sorry.",I was happy.,Oh! Hes ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
"I was happy. He's my Patient. I'm sure he's a good guy, he's pRobably a great guy. PRobably a much better guy than I am. And some part of me wants him to die. I'm just not sure if it's because I want to be with her or if it's because I want her to suffer.",Hey. Is it okay if I talk to Stacy for a minute?,What you did for her is the only reason Im not killing you.
"I'll be just outside, Honey.",You two are good together.,Im just taking you outside!
You know nothing about Mark.,"He took you to Paris, that's good enough for me.","Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, Id expect nothing less."
We nEver went to Paris.,"Your Honeymoon. It's been your dream city, you wanted to go since you were sixteen, he actually took you.",I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
"No, I had to work. We spent the night in New York, then went back to Short Hills. What is it?",When did Mark switch from mountain biking to yoga?,"No, I was just visiting a friend."
"About a month ago. The same time he started getting sick, what does that mean?",We have two more symptoms.,Whats wrong with him now?
We have two more symptoms.,Patient was asked a series of questions to determine the functionality of his brain.,"We should probably call a doctor or something, dude."
You grilled him about Stacy.,WhatEver.,"No, um, no not yet."
"He said he went to Paris and the PET confirms it, so what?",They didn't go.,Its in Paris.
But there are other symptoms of AIP.,Such as?,Those are also the side effects of having a 75yearold man with an erection climb on top of you.
Such as? Light sensitivity?,"Yeah, well, one of the true tragEdies of this condition is it makes you want to stick your cool, new mountain bike in the garage and take up an indoor sport like, say, yoga.","Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean Im sensitive."
And there's no way to predict when he'll have another attack.,Sure there is.,How? He cant hit back.
Sure there is.,"Acute Intermittent Porphyria has very specific triggers. Barbiturates, alcohol, high lEvels of protein set off an attack.","Theres not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be."
Which trigger do you think set off Mark's?,"Not the faintest idea, that's why I'm going to give him the combo plate.","Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing."
"So if he has this, and you trigger the attack, the attack makes him worse. Right?",Yeah. But then we'll know what it is and we can treat it.,"It does. But in my experience, you dont."
What if I don't have this thing and you give me that shot? What happens?,No idea. If we don't know what's messing up your brain we don't know how you'll react.,"Well, theres no way Im gonna get a shot."
"Okay, I need a minute with my husband. The team leaves. Mark is shown talking through the glass, then Stacy gets up and leaves. He doesn't want the trigger. He wants to wait, see if we can come up with another explanation. If it is the AIP, how much time does he have?","No idea. Next attack could be fatal. Could be six months from now, could be five minutes from now.","Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting."
I want you to test him.,"Fine. I'll send for a HMB synthetase mutation, genetic test. Lab will get back to us in a month.",He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.
"Give him the cocktail, set off an attack.",No.,You have a drink thatll make him less obnoxious?
No. Why not?,Because he doesn't want me to.,Of course not.
I'm not going to sue you. I'm not going to report you.,He might.,"Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued."
"He's paralyzed! Either you cure him, or he won't be writing any letters.",I'm not gonna do it.,That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
I'm not gonna do it. Why not?,"You keep asking me that question my answer doesn't change. I gave him the parameters, it's his call.","I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie."
You want him to die.,"I diagnosed him, I did my job. You want somebody to tie him down and force him into treatment, well, you're way better at that than I am.","Theres nothin I can do about it, kid."
Is that what this is? Payback for your leg? How Many times have we been over this I saved your life.,"Yeah, maybe.",You broke a little girls leg?
You're going to kill my husband to teach me a lesson?,"No, he's going to die because he's too stubborn to make the right choice.",Are you going to order him to kill me?
Now we're in your territory.,"I'm respecting your husband's decision, I don't see why you've got a pRoblem with that.",I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
"Because it's crap! Because you browbeat Patients, intimidate them, lie to them. If you think you're right you don't give a damn what they think. I did what you do all the time, the only difference is I did it to you.",He'll nEver forgive you.,"Because I dont respect therapy, because Im a scientist."
Not like you do. I only met him when he drugged me.,"at the doorway Boy, are my ears burning.",I thought you only met him once?
"at the doorway Boy, are my ears burning. What's that?",holding up a syringe Cocktail hour. Just because you can't hoist a few doesn't mean you should be left out.,"Dont come in here, dont come in here, dont come in here, dont Aw!"
I would. I don't.,"Smart. Too bad you're paralyzed. He takes the IV to push the syringe, but Foreman stops him. Bing! Paging Dr. Foreman! Leave the room. It's not your pRoblem.",Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
You need the consent from him.,"Doc, he ain't right in the head!",No he did not.
Then you need a court order.,"Okay, then get one.","Relationship agreement Section 4, Booboos and Ouchies."
"near tears Please, if you're right this may be his only shot.",So what's your plan?,What do you think his chances are?
You son of a bitch!,See what I did there?,Son of a Bitch!
"checking Mark's vitals If he had AIP, it should have already happened.",Everyone's different.,"Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Marks an idiot."
"Is that an attack? Cameron runs over with the Ativan, but House swipes it away with his cane.","No, you'll pollute the sample! Chase, get urine from the catheter.","No, its a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now."
He needs Ativan!,This is not a stroke! Delta wave bursts just at the base of the spasm. The catheter falls to the floor.,"I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake."
"Heart rate's in the 40s, bradycardia, we're losing him!",Hold him down!,I sense his life force is fading.
Give him something!,No pain killers!,"All right, well, cant you, like, slip him some money or something?"
"You were wrong! House doesn't listen, but grabs a syringe and sticks the needle into Mark's bladder, pulling out the urine sample.","Straight from the bladder, that's as fresh as it gets. Will you give him the Ativan already? He doesn't need to be awake for this.","Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye."
It's still yellow.,grabbing a lamp Move.,Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
You think another light's gonna make the difference?,Organic chem..,Maybe Ill just turn the lights down a little.
Dr. House? How's he doing?,looking in again NEver better.,Wow. Hows he doing?
You fixed him.,De nada.,I brought him back.
Thank you. You were right.,He's gonna be fine.,"Hey, you were right."
"No, about me. I'm not over you. You were, you were the one, you always will be. But I can't be with you.","So I'm the guy, but you want the other guy, who by definition can nEver be the guy.",But getting over was the hardest thing that Ive ever had to do.
"What's so great about you, you always think you're right. What's so frustrating about you is you are right so much of the time. You are brilliant, funny, surprising, sexy! but with you I was lonely, and with Mark there's room for me.","Okay. Stacy kisses him on the cheek, then leaves.","Oh honey, thank you, but Marks taking me out."
I want to run something by you.,"loudly I will not have sex with you! Not again! Miserable, that first time. All that desperate, administrative need","Hey, hey why dont you run it by me and Ill run it by him."
"Stacy's husband is going to need close monitoring at the hospital. And since we can definitely use her back here, I've offered her a job. General Counsel.",Did she say yes?,Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work.
She said only if it was okay with you. House starts to walk off as The Rolling Stones' You Can't Always Get What You Want plays ironically in the background. Yes or no?,Fine. Good.,"Well, the old lady died."
You can't go in there.,"Who are you, and why are you wearing a tie?",You cant be in here!
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant. Can I tell her what it's regarding?,Yes. I would like to know why she gets a secretary and I don't.,"What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COOs office on the phone this instant!"
"I'm her assistant, not her secretary. I graduated from Rutgers.",Hmm.,"Oh, shes regional Vice President Shes."
"Dr. House, we are in the middle of a meeting.",What's with hiring a male secretary? JDate not working out?,"Dwight, Im in a meeting."
He is cute. Be careful.,She's not like you. She can't just walk into a bar and pick up her soul mate in twenty minutes.,"Dont tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute."
I met Mark at a fundraiser that happened to be held at a,You met me at a strip club.,Nice to meet you Mark!
If you have a pRoblem working with Stacy you should have said so.,What was I supposed to do? Ask her to leave? That's just rude. Death row guy. I want the case.,"Andy, if he didnt want her working here then why did you hire her?"
How do you Even know about him? You don't have access to the hospital's mainframe.,"No, but partypants does.","Well, then have the robot go and get him."
You stole my password?,Hardly counts as stealing it's a pretty obvious choice.,You hacked my facebook account?
"Well, I have already assigned Death Row Guy to Dr. Nolo.","Nolo? Well, I don't want to say anything bad about another doctor, but! especially a useless drunk!","Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I dont think thats a good idea. In fact, I think hes dead."
You are addicted to pain pills.,But I'm not useless. Tell Nolo I'm talking over.,Why dont I write you a prescription for Xanax.
Dr. Nolo is a board certified cardiologist.,"Oh, good.","No not you, Dr."
How badly do you want this?,I will give you two more clinic hours this week.,You know what I really really want?
"Just the heart, or the Patient have any other complaints?",The Patient's not talking to anybody.,"Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery."
Where are we going?,You are going to the clinic for two hours.,Where will we go?
You are going to the clinic for two hours. Me? Why?,"Talk to Cuddy. She's got me going to Mercer State Prison, Capital Sentences unit, I don't know.","Yknow what? The doctor will be in soon, why dont we not speak until then."
Aren't there better ways to spend our time?,Good question. What makes a person deserving? Is a Man who cheats on his wife more deserving than a Man who kills his wife?,Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
"Uh! yeah. Actually, he is.",What about a Parkld molester?,"No, but he is."
"Your Patient shanked one inmate his first month here, broke another one's neck, nearly decapitated one of my guards!","Relax, I've got a great bedside Manner.","Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?"
"Too dangerous to House him in the infirmary. You don't have to worry, we've taken Every precaution. I've had my men clear from the cell all pens, paperclips and staplers. Any supplies that might be used as a weapon. We see Clarence, shackled to a cot in a room full of office supplies. Open her up! For your visit, we've got him cuffed and shackled.","And yet, you're staying out there.",Why is my brother in a cell?
All she has is a cough.,"Bluish tinge to the fingernails, lips! he's hypoxic.",What is wrong with Emma?
What's that mean?,It means he's not getting enough oxygen.,"No! No! No! No its not! No its not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we dont have the We dont have thethat lamp! Andand that screen is yknow, on the other side."
Don't have a respirator.,"Better get one in about an hour, or you're gonna lose him.",How about if I just dont breathe at all?
I'll make out a requisition. The state's already sentenced this Man to die.,flipping open his cell phone I think the state was a tad more specific about how.,Ill lock him in a cell until he rots.
"Wasted call, my men will stop them at the gate. No way a Death Row inmate leaves my prison, at least not through the front doors.",You work fast.,What are you doing?
So do you.,Was that a shot?,And so do I.
"Yeah. It was easy once I convinced the clerk to take it to Judge Markem, she's a sucker for Eighth Amendment arguments.","Stop, I'm getting turned on.",You brought a lawyer?
"Stop, I'm getting turned on. House!",in his best Scooby-Doo imitation Ruh-row!,Oh my God!
It was just a consult! You expect us to shut down an entire floor for this guy?!,Did you do something to your hair?,Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. Grab his feet. Lets go!
You said you cleared with her,Come on. You've known me how long and you still don't know when I'm joshin' ya?,"Okay, I told her youd talk to her."
Take him back to prison. Now.,"No, can't.",Spare his life.
"No, can't. See, ironically I'm bound by this court order which your ace attorney got. I have to make him all better before shipping him back for the state to kill him. Is it just me, or is that weird? Anyway, we're walking.",Somebody left this on my chair. It's clEver. Forces me to either deal with the file or nEver sit down again.,No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.
Cindy Kramer. I told her you'd see her.,"You shouldn't have told her that. She's got metastatic squamous cell lung cancer, six months, tops.","Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant."
Have you Even looked at the x-ray?,"No, just guessing. It's a new game. If I'm wrong, she gets a stuffed bear.","Im telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong."
A spot on a x-ray doesn't necessarily mean that she's terminal.,I love Parkldren. So filled with hope.,"Yes, which is why she was in the telescope room."
It could be pneumonia. It could be sarcodosis.,"Could be, if she didn't already have swollen hilar lymph nodes on the other lung.","And snoring. And thats probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. Its a throat doctor."
"Could we at least brainstorm for other ideas? He takes the x-ray and puts it up on the light board. Thank you. He begins to write on the board. I still think it could be pneumonia and sarcodosis, but we should check for tuberculosis and definitely rule out congestive heart failure. She looks to see that House has written denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance on the board. The five stages of dying.",Exactly.,"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox."
following him in The Death Row guy? That's who you're working on instead of Cindy?,"God, I've got to learn not to beat around the bush.","What, hes not still following her."
I took an oath to do no harm.,"Yeah, well, it's not like they make you sign it or anything.",Im well aware of your oath.
"We cure your Patient, he goes back to Death Row. He goes back to Death Row, they kill him!","He stays here and we don't treat him, he dies, and I still don't treat Cindy Lou-Who.",You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.
Can we get on with this?,"Yeah, I knew I could count on your help for your homie.",Can we please move this along?
"sarcastically Exactly, I'm black. I sympathize for guys who grew up in the city kept down by the Man. Chase smirks.",Makes sense to me.,"Well you dont get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and youre."
Are you serious?,The Man knows prisons.,Get outta here.
He starts to move around violently. Water! water.,What's the differential for being thirsty?,His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
"Blood and urine tests came back clean, no sign of opiates in his system. Cameron grabs a marker and is about to write on the board, when!",Don't do that.,"Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess theres no point in bringing it up."
"What, you have some House theory explaining heroin use despite a negative test?",Nope.,That was a valid hypothesis?
His bi-carb is low.,"Yeah, but which column? Could be the result of the tachycardia, could be the cause?",Thats because he drinks too much soy milk.
It's the cause.,"Why, because you want it to be? Let's see how well that works with your other Patient.",I dont want to blame anyone in particular.
We're just talking seMantics here. We should put him on a bi-carb drip and send him back.,"Right, buff his numbers. Don't bother trying to figure out the underlying cause. I thought you cared about Patients.","Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now!"
"Our job isn't to make sure he can bounce his grandkids on his lap, our job is to get him healthy enough to go back to Death Row.",closing the blinds so he can't see Stacy Our job is to diagnose him.,"Oh, come on, hes a grown man, he can take care of himself."
"Were you trying to get me fired? If you didn't want me working here, why didn't you just say so?","I just don't want you working right here, in my office. But anywhere else in the building is fine. It's a big hospital.","Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have."
I'm a Lawyer. You're a jerk. There's gonna to be some overlap.,"God, I hope that was a euphemism.","Well, Im a lawyer."
Cuddy just reamed me.,I hope that one means what I think it means.,You shouldve put him in custardy.
For trusting you! She figured when she hired me she'd at least have someone you couldn't walk all over.,"The number was six, by the way.",Was she happy you gave her the job?
"I need to know, can I trust you?","If I hadn't lied to you about Cuddy's approval, my Patient would be dead.","I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
Blood gas came back with a pH of 7.28 and decreased HCO3.,Which means two things.,"Yep. Acidic, all right."
"What if Clarence thought he was taking heroin, but it was something else?",What something else could lead to anion gap acidosis?,"He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide."
What something else could lead to anion gap acidosis? Mudpiles.,"Well, you don't have to ask. Just wash your hands before you come back.","Youre sure it was water, it couldnt have been acid?"
"Methanol, uremia, diabetes!","Oh, it's a mnemonic. That makes sense, too.",Youre out of Diet Coke.
"Paraldehyde, INH, lactic acid",Rewind.,Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?
Rewind. INH?,Yahtzee!,Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Nearly a quarter of the prison population is infected with TB.,"ClEver entrepreneur like Foreman here, chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin.",I cant bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.
INH poisoning would explain all the symptoms.,Who wants to head over to the prison and find Clarence's secret stash? No one looks too thrilled.,"Hunger? Indigestion, Im sorry Im really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, were going to participate in my cousin Leopolds drug intervention."
"Fine, I'll do it.","Great, Chase it is.","All right. All right, Ill do it."
I assume you have a reason beyond wanting to make me completely miserable?,You've got a prettier mouth. Better chance the inmates will open up to you.,Why do you want me to leave?
The Man's in a coma.,He didn't mind. I asked.,"The Coma Guys Room, Monica bursts in, closely followed by Phoebe."
You're getting crumbs all over him.,"Why do you think they put TVs in coma Patients' rooms, anyway?","Youre a real crumb bum, you know that?"
Some people think they can still hear.,So leave them a radio. His eyes are closed who thinks they can see? Wilson sits on the opposite side of the bed.,I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Do you know why people are nice to other people?,"Oh, I know this one.",Its called being nice.
"Exactly. You're gonna eat these Parkps? He reaches for them, but House grabs them away.",You gonna get to your point?,"Eh, no, hes not going to eat it, is he?"
You need people to like you.,I don't care if people like me.,"Its very important for you to be liked, isnt it?"
"!Yes. But you need people to like you because you need people. Unless you think you can get the next court order yourself. If Stacy can't trust you, you can't use her. House hands over the Parkp bag. And that's not Even dealing with the greater agenda House takes the bag back before Wilson can have any of getting her to dump her husband and fall in love with you all over again.","Look I know you're friends with her, but there is a code.",As long as you dont see Rachel anymore.
What is it?,Death Row guy is dying.,I didnt get anything for Valentines Day.
"Bradycardia. His heart rate's dropped to 30, it's not going to hold that much longer.","Are you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine?","Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned Me and my Girlfriend?"
"Are you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine? Temporary fix?",Right. Don't know why those diabetics are all hung up on insulin. They're just gonna have to have to take more. He starts to push the Atropine into the IV.,Yeah. I heard you might need it. So...
Atropine's only gonna buy you a few hours! We don't Even know what's wrong with him,Just get out of here. Foreman leaves as Clarence's heart rate starts to climb.,Hes been in bed for two days.
on cell This is Chase.,from the hospital desk near Diagnostics Did you beat any confessions out of anybody?,"Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your."
I haven't spoken to any inmates.,Does anybody do their jobs anymore?,Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
I've decided Clarence's life isn't worth risking mine for.,I appreciate your candor. Did you Even go to the prison or are you just out playing polo?,"You know, I really dont feel very comfortable making this decision."
"I'm searParkng both Clarence's cells. I figure, if he's on something, it's stashed somewhere.",Unless he finished it.,Weve got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
"Yeah, that'd be a shame. He could have shoved it anywhere, there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling, bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands he goes on, but House has heard enough",Call it off. Come on back.,Well we left ours in Monicas bedroom.
What's going on?,You're dying. -- and takes out a bottle of rum and pours two shots' worth. A Man deserves a last drink.,Shes all right.
A Man deserves a last drink. You're okay.,Thanks. That means a lot. He helps Clarence to drink his shot.,Im not done with my drink.
I work for one of the top diagnosticians in the country. We're pouring all of our energy into figuring this out.,slurred slightly Thought you convicts knew how to drink.,Im between specialists right now.
"House She stops short as she sees House laughing and pouring shots. I was just waiting for test results, I was!",Little busy right now. Getting my drink on.,"Rosss Building, they are approaching the apartment of the woman who died."
Oof. That's the finest piece I've seen in ten years.,I could've hit that.,"Boy, oh, boy, thats a lot of pieces."
And you didn't.,Eh.,But I didnt.
Then you're the one that should be locked up.,"Tell me something, I've been trying to figure this out.","All right, thats enough jail talk."
"It just hit me all of a sudden. It was like, they tell me when to eat, when to sleep, when to walk, when to talk, Everything. I had to take control of something, right? When to die, I figured that was as good as anything.",pouring more rum And that thought just came to you. Just like that.,"Ugh, its so exhausting waiting for death."
"Man, I told you. Twenty-three hours a House forces another shot down his throat.",Mmm.,One. Two. Three. Shot!
"Man, you are drunk.","Yes, I am. I also saved your life. And, a shot for House! Laughing At least for now.","Ah, a burro, of course."
Morning! House winces at the sound. Your head hurt?,"No, you just have a very grating voice.",Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!
You always were a light weight.,Why are you talking to me?,Ive seen old pictures of you.
"Can't it be enough that I want to cause you pain? The Patient's okay now, you're going to send him back?",Absolutely.,"Hey. I cant concentrate when I know youre in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. Cmon, my treat."
You used to.,I still think the Patient's sick.,didnt till just now.
"Yeah, I have. With contrast?",entering She's done Everything she needs to do except tell her Patient that she's dying.,"Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it."
I'm not telling Cindy she's dying until the diagnosis is confirmed.,I'm not buying that CLARENCE is trying to take control of his life by suicide. Healthy people don't kill themselves.,"So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman whos clinging to life are the words, Hey, Vivian."
Healthy people don't kill other people.,Guy just filed an appeal in a state that hasn't actually killed anybody in about 30 years.,"Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way."
"What if it wasn't suicide? What if it was an escape plan? Drink enough methanol to get transferred to a hospital, try to escape from here?",Excellent.,"Umm, look it, youyou cant kill yourself."
"You killed four people. Somehow, making mac and cheese just the way he wants kind of loses its significance.",Oh no. Now you've left your entire body in my chair. What does that mean you want?,"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him."
I need a segmental bronchoalveolar lavage.,I take it the CT with contrast came back.,"Damn, I need my inhaler."
They're not definitive.,Biopsy would be.,"Yes they are, you just dont care about the information."
Biopsy would be invasive and unnecessary.,"And definitive. But you don't want definitive, you want to hang on to your delusions as long as you can.",The procedure is far too dangerous which is why its now forbidden.
A lavage could prove it's not cancer.,But you need me to approve the procedure. Must be a bitch. The answer is no.,"No, its too wrinkly to be a mole."
"Why? Because it's me? I'm over you. I've jumped on the bandwagon. I hate you, okay?",Great. Let's treat her.,I just cant stand you being here all the time.
"What is it? You won't help Cindy but you're obsessed with this piece of dirt! Are you just trying to prove that who someone is doesn't matter, that all that matters is your stupid puzzle? Fine. Treat them the same. That's all I'm asking. One test.","Wow, that is remarkable.",What? She didnt give me any puzzles.
Your Death Row guy's still here!,"Yeah, sorry. Just gotta get him stabilized. PRobably keep him on fluids for a few more hours, then off he goes.","Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go."
Oh yeah? 'Cause I'm figuring that you still think he's sick.,"Figuring requires deductive reasoning. I'm figuring that you did no figuring. Stacy just ratted me out, right? So much for attorney-client privledge.",well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
"I'm the client, you moron. Stacy has a duty to this hospital.",Right.,"Phoebe, your next clients in the waiting room."
I'm sending him back to prison.,"Whoa, can't. Court order.",Get him out of my sight.
Would you describe it as a shooting pain? A thRobbing pain? Or maybe an imaginary pain because you don't want to go back to prison?,Where does it hurt?,Theres a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down.
"My gut, I feel like I'm getting stabbed! Screams again.","Well, he'd know. Let me take a look.",Then I was stabbed in the belly.
"Oh, so Everybody lies except a convicted murderer. CGI shot of some nasty stuff in Clarence's bowels. Ew. House removes the covers to rEveal blood flowing out of Clarence's nether regions. More ew.","I don't think he's faking this stuff. What do you think, Doctor? Clarence screams a lot more for emphasis.","This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder."
I didn't have any choice.,"No, you had to tell Cuddy. She's your boss, I get it. Hitler thought he was doing the world a favor, too.",Yeah! Lets do it!
"Yeah, pretty much on that same lEvel.","Gandhi didn't march the sea because his buddies asked him too, Pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers because he wanted to make friends.","And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat."
You're not making friends right now.,I trusted you.,You cant expect to be friends with everybody.
I trusted you. I know.,Wilson's a fool. I'm an idiot.,I trust you.
I had to do what I thought was right.,It's the only reason anybody does anything.,You did the right thing.
The surgery went fine. They removed almost a foot of necrotic bowel. They're shackling him and taking him to recovery.,I wonder. I wonder why Clarence killed that second inmate.,Hey! So how was the doctor?
"Fine, I'll bite. What the hell are you talking about?",Everything we do is dictated by motive. As he erases the white board Why did he kill his girlfriend?,Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
Because he's a Maniac!,Is that the reason he gave?,Because hes terrible!
She was cheating on him.,"Jealousy. He writes it on the board. That gets him sent to prison, where he kills inmate number one. Why?",Wait. Why was he yelling at her? Hes the one who slept with someone else.
Guy attacked him first.,REvenge. Who'd he killed after that?,They tried to murder him first.
Who'd he killed after that? Prison guard.,Who had a file full of abusive complaints. PRobably been kicking Clarence's ass for months.,Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
Clarence is just ridding the world of bad seeds.,Call that one retribution. Then he kills inmate number two. Anybody know why? Chase looks through the file. Nuh-uh. It's not in there. He draws a giant question mark.,Thats what Mose said about his lady scarecrow and look what he did to that poor thing.
All of a sudden I got to have a reason?,It's an anomaly.,"No, a reason."
"It happened when I was in gen-pop. I was in the library, just readin', and I started feelin' real nervous. This guy was staring at me, I could feel his eyes digging holes in the back of my neck, it made me feel crazy. Sweat was pouring down my face. I could hear my heartbeat racing in my ears. I just raged out on the dude.",So what's the differential for raging out?,A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
"Excess testosterone, steroids Adrenaline",Prep Clarence for surgery.,"You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises."
Care to share with the class.,"Oh, come on.",Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
But pheo's extremely rare.,I love rare. Set up an MRI. Where's Cameron? They shrug. Like I don't know.,Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
She goes back in. Pheo what?,I don't Even remember.,What? She didnt come back?
But not for me?,I assume you got those tattoos in prison.,"Well, its probably not for me."
I assume you got those tattoos in prison. Prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals. The MRI's basically a giant magnet. It'd suck those metallic inks right out of your skin.,Stop squirming. Don't make us do this again. Big baby.,"I dont know, check your body for tattoos?"
Turn it off!,"There's Waldo. Found it, Clarence.","Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?"
Turn it off! Turn this damn thing off!,Keep him in there until you guys see it too. He leaves.,"Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?"
Looks like they got the pheo out successfully. So what now?,Clarence goes back to Death Row.,"Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?"
Just like that?,He's cured.,You mean like this?
"That tumor caused random shots of adrenaline, which obviously led to the rage attacks that made him become a murderer in the first place.","My God, you're right! Let's call the surgeons, we've got to save that tumor. Put it on the witness stand.","So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath."
We could testify at Clarence's appeal.,sniffs You smell that?,The trial will be today.
A person's upbringing and their biology are completely different.,Yeah.,"Well, people are different."
You want him to be executed?,That's not what I'm saying.,"No, My Lords."
Got an opinion?,"Everyone's got an opinion. Foreman turns to leave as Hallelujah, the most overused great song in media begins to play.","Oh, gee, its a little late for coffee, isnt it?"
"I, um, I think I'm gonna testify at Clarence's appeal.",You'll do what you think is right. On your own time. He leaves.,"Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing."
House! Need you.,"Uh uh, forget it. I'm going home.",I get the dollhouse!
I'm going home. Hay fEver?,"Boy, you must be a doctor and Everything!","Oh honey thank God youre home, I was getting worried."
"Boy, you must be a doctor and Everything! Two minutes.","No, the purple thingy on the file means that whoEver is one of yours, which means cancer, which means no way is it two minutes.","Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and theyd blow us off, and then wed tell each other they were probably gay."
"Fine, I'm lying. 30 minutes.",Mystery of life.,"30 seconds, okay."
Benadryl might help.,I already did 1000 milligrams. He sneezes,Warm milk and Excedrin P.
He sneezes Steam room?,Why Jimmy. We'll talk about this in the morning.,You know the best part of working in the clean room?
I've got a nine year old with cancer. Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Terminal kid trumps your stuffy nose.,Not yet.,"Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler."
She's hallucinating. He said the magic word,So the Rhabdo's in her brain. Make her comfortable she's got about a week.,"Its so weird, she was saying it just before you got here."
"Yeah except there is no cancer in her brain. Pristine CT scan, blood tests, protein markers all negative.",The cancer's in remission? Which means the hallucinations are unconnected.,"Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow well find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and Im not feeling all that well."
Fascinating huh? And not that it matters but if you fix whatEver's going on in her head you give her maybe another year. Long time for a nine year old.,No. It'll just fly by.,"Look, nono, hey, hey, dont worry about it!"
If it was me I'd just stay home and watch TV or something. Not lie here under a microscope.,"Don't worry, anything happens to you nobody's is going to lift a finger. Differential diagnosis on your marks, get set!","Hold up, Im looking at my spit with a microscope."
Hallucinations could be caused by!,Whoa. Wait for it! Pause and go.,Oh. I hadnt thought about it like that. I wonder if Ive been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.
"No, nothing on mom. Dad split when she was pregnant Cameron hands House a cup of tea his medical history is also clean.",What a guy.,"Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?"
Blood work and LP were clean.,Looking at the scan But where there's infection there's meningial swelling.,"Hi, how was the screening?"
That CT shows no meningial involvement.,True. Get a tox screen and MRI.,They will soon enough.
We can do that if you want to ignore what we just discussed.,Sounds good.,I respect that.
Toxic exposure doesn't make chronological sense.,"Yes, there is a third option she's making it all up because she doesn't want to get in trouble for breaking a mirror.","Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33day fluctuation in mens hormone levels."
What'd I do?,"Oh well, you'd just get all warm and cuddly around the dying girl and insinuate yourself end up in a custody battle.","I know its an excellent school, Dwight."
Black walnut and ginger.,It's nice.,Sprinkle of cinnamon.
A pro. I like it.,Whoa look at the time I should have been out of here 20 minutes ago.,High collar and baggy pants say Im a pro.
You've only been here 20 minutes.,Can't slip anything by you can I.,Ive been in here for 20 seconds.
There's a Patient in one.,I'm taking a sick day.,A waiting room.
Take some Claritin.,Everyone's a doctor suddenly.,"No, I dont want some aspirin, yeah Im a little fussy."
"Balls are in your court, Doctor.",Union rules. I can't check out this guy's seeping gonorrhea this close to lunch.,We are supposed to make these decisions together!
Exam room one.,Well it's sexist and a very dangerous precedent if people could choose the sex of their doctors you gals would be out of business.,"Well, Im a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go."
Exam room one.,Sore throat?,Its easy.
My new girlfriend nEver been with a guy who wasn't c-circumcised so she freaked and,"Aha, and you wanted Rivkah to feel all gemutlicht. I get it it's a shandah.",Are we in a good school district?
I got some box cutters and uh!,Just like Abraham did it.,"OK, I will only need two things."
"I sterilized them which, uh, I was told you're!",Stop talking. I'm gonna get a plastic surgeon. Get the Twinkie back in the wrapper.,"Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, whos gonna do it for me? You?"
"House. Hey, House. Andie's MRI and tox screen were clean. No infection. No neurotoxins.","Oxygen saturation is 94%, check her heart.",How long have you been married to the cheerleader?
Her oxygen saturation is normal.,It's off by one percentage point.,Yeah. Shes fine.
It's within range. It's normal.,If her DNA was off by one percentage point she'd be a dolphin.,"Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate."
But the lungs could lead us somewhere that is.,Welcome to the end of the thought process.,"If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky."
Could be some bizarre case of kyphoscoliosis. Chase laughs,I'm going home.,His hairs flipping out on the sides.
What if it is? Please kiss me.,Bagels.,Honey I swear it we just kissed.
You didn't sleep in.,Didn't sleep. Didn't breathe. I'm dying.,I was sleeping.
Pulmonary angiogram of Andie's lungs was clean. Arterial blood gasses and a CT scan were also normal. Her heart and lungs are fine.,Which gives us no explanation for the diminished sat percentage.,Whats wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
Yeah oddly enough sometimes normal is normal.,Sometime we can't see why normal isn't normal. Get her symptoms on the board.,"Why no, its the opposite of weird."
Whoa you're letting me touch the markers?,"It's written down in my advanced health care directive, should I be incapacitated in any way you run the board, then Foreman. Chase you're just not ready yet. What else?","No. No you cant go. No this is fun. Come on were just getting started. Here, heres your marker."
She's hiding it pretty well if there's any of that going on.,"Yeah, all girls who've been molested want to talk about it. Break out the rape kit.","Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that shes hiding something."
She hasn't had sex.,Why are you so sure?,You havent had sex?
She told me she'd nEver kissed a boy.,You read her diary too?,"Umm, she kissed me."
She asked me to kiss her.,"I rest my case. A regular nine year old girl does not have sex on the brain, not when a doctor is threading a catheter through her vein.","Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?"
But she's not a regular nine year old. She's got terminal cancer.,Cancer doesn't make you special. Molestation on the other hand!,"Yeah. Oh no wait, Im not an nineyearold girl."
She wanted one kiss before she dies. If she's nEver kissed a boy it's a fair bet she's nEver had sex.,Tell that to all the hookers who won't kiss me on the mouth.,Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
It wasn't sick. Foreman and Cameron freak out quietly It was one kiss for a dying girl. One small! one small kiss before she dies. Thank you. Thanks.,This is exactly why you can't touch my markers. Go see if she's had sex.,"Nonono that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss"
With a Patient.,Is she dying?,"Hospital, the guy is in a coma and Mon and Pheebs are visiting."
Is she dying? No.,Then she can wait.,"No, shes hanging in there."
"Would you excuse me, just 2 minutes.",If only she'd been molested then we'd have something to go on. He tries to open a jar of mentholatum No forced entry.,"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment."
"One hallucination maybe it was just bad pork, maybe there's nothing!",She's not fine. Her sat percentage dropped another point.,"Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air."
Which could suggest a tumor in her lung.,"Lung wouldn't explain the hallucination. CT scan showed both lungs were clean, which means there's a tumor in her heart.","No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes."
Not a chance. Give me that.,I loosened it.,"Oh, not gonna happen."
"I opened it. We've got an MRI and an echo of her heart, there's nothing there.",Give me one other explanation for low oxygen saturation.,Yeah. Its a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.
I can't. There's only one condition that simultaneously affects the heart and the brain but she!,Perfect let's go with that.,"No, Im getting three separate heartbeats."
Tuberous Sclerosis in a kid that also has Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Two different unrelated cancers at the same time is a statistical no no.,"What's the rate of cancer in the general population? 1 in 10,000?","Oh, great. Glad they didnt mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy. Oh thats not good."
"Don't, don't start with the numbers.","The way I figure it 1 in 10,000 of them should have another cancer. Little girl won the lottery twice. It happens.",Thats it? Thats the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
So you're gonna cut her open?,"Exploratory surgery, gotta find this thing.",Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
You're just going to grope around inside an immuno-compromised nine year old? She could die on the table.,I know it's somewhere near the heart.,"Cause Im up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out Im pregnant they might give it to someone else."
Why are we here?,Better acoustics. Now listen to this.,"Well, why, why do you think Im here?"
That's a mitral heart valve.,"No, get the wax out of your ears. This is the Patient's aortic valve. I downloaded the audio of her echocardiogram.","I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture."
What are we trying to hear?,Tumor.,"I dunno, Ive been standing here spelling it out for you!"
They tend to keep quiet on account of them not having any mouths.,"But we could hear an abnormality in the sound of the valve, which would indiCate the presence of something a tumor for example.","Well, Im sure the new people will be just as quiet."
Her aortic valve sounds normal.,Too bad. Now listen to the dulcet tones of Andie's tricuspid valve.,"Nono. Contractions can be unnerving if you dont know what they are, but shes fine."
Now listen to the dulcet tones of Andie's tricuspid valve. Normal.,And this is her mitral valve.,Are you sure thats not the gay ear?
I don't hear anything weird.,You guys make me sad. Listen again.,What do you hear?
She's had one hallucination. Why are we operating on her? Why are we risking her life?,Because Wilson thinks it'll be nice to give the girl a year to say good bye to her mommy.,The purpose for this meeting is to take Pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body.
Wait. There. There's an extra flap.,"I'm gonna ask the surgeon to look at the mitral valve first. Chase, I want you there. I don't like reading surgeons reports, they're boring.","Theres this one hanging part in particular, thats some sort of flap."
I'm not really sure I should be spending more time!,She'll be unconscious you'll be safe.,How much time do you have left on your break?
"Brave kid, she Even gave her mom a pep talk.",Sure. Brave. She's a wonder.,Im proud of her.
What's your pRoblem?,These cancer kids you can't put them all on a pedestal. It's basic statistics some of them have to be whiny little fraidy cats.,"Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem."
It's basic statistics some of them have to be whiny little fraidy cats. You're unbelievable.,If there's not one yellow-belly in the group then being brave doesn't have any meaning.,Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds.
Andie handles an impossible situation with grace. That's not to be admired?,You see grace because you wanna to see grace.,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled."
You don't see grace because you won't go anywhere near her.,Idolizing is pathological with you people. You see things to admire where there's nothing.,You dont have to call me Your Grace when no ones around.
"Yeah, well, we're evil.",You find things to admire where you shouldn't be sniffing at all like Debbie in accounting.,"Its tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but theres good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
You find things to admire where you shouldn't be sniffing at all like Debbie in accounting. She's nice.,"You shouldn't know that, you're married.","Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, its creating a bit of a hostile work environment."
"So the little kid dying of cancer, I shouldn't like her?",If you're dying suddenly Everybody loves you.,"Nah, shes a good kid."
"You have a cane, nobody Even likes you.","I'm not terminal, merely pathetic you wouldn't beliEve the crap people let me get away with.","Youre arrogant and pompous, and I dont like you."
She's got a bleed in her eye.,"They got the tumor, repaired her heart but she bled out of her eye.","Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
She didn't bleed out of her eye from a heart tumor.,True. The cardiac tumor was benign.,"No, she didnt."
The cardiac tumor was benign. That's impossible.,Statistically.,"Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body."
Oh shut up. If the tumor's benign that means it didn't cause her hallucinations.,That's why I'm mentioning it.,"Okay, Im gonna have to stop you right there."
So the tumor is a coincidence.,This is bad you're starting to state the obvious.,Huh. It cant be a coincidence. There must be some causal link Im missing.
"No, you said it would be there, it was there. It can't be a coincidence.",A nine year old with terminal cancer gets an unrelated benign tumor growing in her heart why?,"And even if it did, its just a coincidence."
It's benign? That's impossible.,Talk to Wilson.,"Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you."
What's the theory here? This girl's body's a lemon? Faulty Manufacturing? Everything's falling apart.,The tumor is Afghanistan the clot is Buffalo.,"Hey guys, great response time."
"Whoa, whoa, you're trying to say that the tumor threw a clot before we removed it.","It was an excellent metaphor, angio her brain for this clot before it straps on an explosive vest.",All you said was I had to get rid of things.
"It was an excellent metaphor, angio her brain for this clot before it straps on an explosive vest.",Angio was clean.,Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
There's no clot?,"There's a clot, we just can't find it.",Is there blood coming out of my ears?
We can't do exploratory surgery on her brain.,Are you sure you're not a neurologist?,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.
"Sighs Okay, she's gonna die.",Well the clots not gonna to go away quietly. It could blow at anytime. Are you gonna let them know?,"Well, if she isnt then cremating her was a big mistake."
To tell Andie she's going to die? That's very un-you.,She's such a brave girl. I want to see how brave she is when you tell her she's gonna die.,"Well, it doesnt make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day."
Go to hell.,What would you do if you were told you were gonna die?,Hell is filled with people like you.
"I don't know, I'd be devastated.","You'd cry like a baby, Everybody would, but she's not doing anything. She's a rock.","Oh, thats a shame, hes gonna be devastated."
She's a rock. She's brave.,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why?,She is a warrior!
She's gone through more than most people do in a lifetime.,So what? Does that mean she's ready to die? What if her bravery is a symptom? The clot is causing hallucinations and messing with her emotions.,"Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything."
You think her bravery is chemically based.,Would tell us where to look for the clot. Where's the fears center?,"I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me."
The Amygdala near the hippocampus it's a big area and a busy one. You blindly cut in there you'll kill her. The only time you're going to see this clot is at autopsy.,Then let's do that.,Thats where the heart is.
Then let's do that.,Is it still illegal to perform an autopsy on a living person?,"Well that sounds simple enough, lets just do that."
Are you high?,"If it's Tuesday, I'm wasted.",You wanna get high?
"If it's Tuesday, I'm wasted. It's Wednesday.",I want to induce a hypothermic cardiac arrest. Once the Patients on bypass we siphon off two liters of blood then perfuse the brain while she's in an MRI.,"Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks its Friday. So, keep that goin."
You're actually talking about killing her.,"Just for a little while, I'll bring her right back.",And you want me to kill her?
"Oh, well, in that case go ahead. Why are we Even talking?","If we do nothing she's dead in a day, maybe a week the kind that lasts.","Oh, well then, by all means, carry on."
We need FDA approval for any surgical technique that's used for diagnostic purposes.,"Absolutely. If we were doing anything invasive but there's nothing invasive. He almost sneezes Gah. You know, I'm not cutting into her head I'm just looking for a clot.","As a vet, Im sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so lets save the measuring for when our dicks are out, its time to save a life!"
Not invasive? You're killing her.,"Don't split hairs, if it works she lives.",Youre making her uncomfortable.
Make sure the mom understands that this is a million to one shot.,I'll see that Wilson passes that along.,"Bernadette, come on, look, youre overthinking this, okay?"
Signed consent forms.,Great. Thanks.,"I see. Is that all right? Im sorry, but this is a litigious society. Im gonna need verbal consent."
You sound better.,"I stacked a combo of mentholatum, a few vicodin and something else which I can't remember.",Thats better. Now tell me whats bothering you.
Should be able to ride the high for a couple hours what did Andie say? About what?,About this.,So what did they say?
I didn't talk to her she doesn't need to know the specifics of this procedure.,What if you're right about her? What if she just is that brave?,"Ooh! Theres no way to do this without her? Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
That doesn't mean she's mature enough to handle this kind of decision.,Either she understands or she's not brave. You can't have it both ways. If she does understand! then she deserves to know what's going on.,"Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!"
Either she understands or she's not brave. You can't have it both ways. If she does understand! then she deserves to know what's going on.,I'm doctor House.,"Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this."
I've seen you around.,Did your mom tell you what we're gonna try?,I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Did your mom tell you what we're gonna try? Sorta.,"Tomorrow's test could take ten hours, in your present condition you might not Even make it through.","I guess you talked to your mom, huh?"
My mom's done a lot of research.,"How do you feel about it? If we figured maturity came from how much time you've got left instead how long you've been here, this would be your call.",Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother wont be able to.
I don't have a choice right?,I could give you one.,"You must do what you feel is right, of course."
I wanna get better.,You've got cancer. I fix this!,"Look, Im gonna get better."
I've got a year.,A year of this. A lot of people wouldn't want that. A lot of people would just want it to be over.,"All right, but you cant use that again for a whole year."
Are you asking if I want to die?,"Nobody wants to die. But you're going to. The question is how, how much you're gonna suffer and how long. I'm asking if you want this to be over.","I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young."
What would you tell my mom?,I could give her ten excellent medical reasons why we can't do this procedure.,What are you going to tell your mother?
I can't just leave her cause I'm tired.,But you can't stay for her either.,"Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off."
But she needs me here.,"This is your life, you can't do this just for her.",So what are you doing bringing her here?
I love her.,Thank you for joining me for tonight's dress rehearsal.,Do you love her?
"Thank you for joining me for tonight's dress rehearsal. Playing the part of Andie is Morty Randolph. He gestures at a cadaver For his donation to science we give our thanks. Once Andie is cool and goes off bypass we have 60 seconds to get 2 liters of blood out of her body and back into her for the pictures to find the clot in her head. IF our star is bumped tomorrow He barely touches the cadaver and lights start to flash while my MRI is on these red lights will go off which will mean we have no useable test results. No test results its goodbye Broadway. You guys will be wearing bad cat suits in Des Moines. Neurosurgeons here, with a view of the monitors. Cardiac surgeon there, in case we need to open her up. Anesthesiologists, one by the cardiac bypass maParkne, one by the cooling apparatus. Girls in the chorus if you're over 5' 10 stick with me. Okay give me 60 seconds on the clock. Showtime. A five, six, sEven, eight! siphon off the blood through the arterial line WHOOSH, sound of blood draining. More whoosh. Glug, glug, glug and we! Red lights Kill her. Again.",How hard can this be?,"Oh, by the way, tomorrow were auditioning for a Broadway show."
How hard can this be?,Again!,Think you can handle this?
How hard can this be? Again!,Again!,Thats too hard.
Again! Again!,Again!,One more time.
We could bolt her to the table.,"Gruesome and low tech. Kiss me I love it. A five, six, sEven, eight!","Yes, hitting her with a frying pans a good idea."
Here you go doctor.,This'll make you sleep.,"Thank you, Dr."
A lot of people.,Big musical number kiddo a lot of people here to make you look good.,"Well, a lot of people who werent available, but then me."
He gets that sometimes.,Okay go.,Does he ever.
He gets that sometimes. Okay go.,Start the cooling. You. Go.,"All right, then go."
Go. She's shivering.,200 milligrams of vecuronium.,Go. Get the door.
200 milligrams of vecuronium.,What? She's dead that's the whole idea. Go.,Prescription or nonprescription strength.
What? She's dead that's the whole idea. Go.,Okay put the blood back in reperfuse the circuit.,So bring the dead to her.
Okay put the blood back in reperfuse the circuit.,Anything people? Anything at all?,"Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
Vestibulocolcular nerve intact.,Keep looking.,Vulcan nerve pinch!
Keep looking. There!,I didn't see anything.,Well keep looking.
It was there.,Are you sure?,"Yeah, its in there."
I saw it.,That's good enough for me.,"Yes, I saw."
You're treating your stuffy nose with cocaine?,Diphenhydramine. Antihistamine. New delivery system it's a blood brain barrier thing.,"Oh wow! What now Ross youre not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean youd think the damn jalepeno wouldve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! Thats not enough What are you doing?!"
It's all about speed isn't it? One thing to another nEver standing still. You're pretty good at that.,I know my way around a razor blade.,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
I know my way around a razor blade. It's time.,Just a couple more rocks.,"Come on, scissors, scissors!"
Andie's going home.,"Right, parade of the small bald circus freaks. Sorry, I got a thing.","Oh thank god, if Phoebes going, can we please take Emma home?"
I read the surgeon's report.,Oh?,I heard what happened.
Clot was nowhere near her Amygdala. Means her fear emotions were working perfectly.,Yeah.,"Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans."
Yeah. So her bravery was not a symptom.,Yeah.,"Yes, but you didnt portray her as completely irrational."
She enjoys life more than you do.,Right.,"Shes living my life, and shes doing it better than me!"
She stole that kiss from Chase. What have done lately?,I'm pacing myself unlike her I have the luxury of time.,whats up is Phoebe ok?
Handing her tickets to the American Museum of Natural History In case you want to see real butterflies. They hug and she kisses him on the cheek,I'm not gonna kiss you no matter what you say. She hugs him,Oh. He takes the picture and hugs her.
"It's sunny outside, you should go for a walk.",He looks at his cane Not much for long walks in the Park. Now get.,I just went out for a walk.
Now get. Right leg?,Huh?,What about your left?
Your right leg? You can still ride. We've got excellent financing right now. It lists for 10-8 but I'll let you steal it out the door for 10-3.,No thanks. He starts to leave and then turns back Could I test drive one of these things?,Sure! I feel so bad for you I broke my leg once too.
How does falling off your roof do that to a guy's fingers?,Could have tweaked a vertebrae in his neck.,Not just the finger.
"Could have tweaked a vertebrae in his neck. Could have pinged on the ulnar!House is staring down at a red stain on Cuddy's tank top just below her breasts. Sorry, trouble concentrating. That tank top really absorbs moisture.","Could have pinged the ulnar nerve, cut the blood flow. Or it could be",Maybe hes having a lovers spat with Penny.
"DIC.? Guy falls off a roof, the first thought is it's always a clotting pRoblem",Trauma can activate the clotting enzymes. Guy could loose more than his hand.,"Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People dont just fall off of ladders."
Do I get bonus points if I act like I care?,"Cervical MRI, work up for DIC, and start him on a heparin drip",Do you want me to want you to care?
"Cervical MRI, work up for DIC, and start him on a heparin drip Who?",You want to know his name? throws file down on the table I'm sure it's in the file.,"Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please?"
You want to know his name? throws file down on the table I'm sure it's in the file.,"Or you could ask her. She's his oldest, bestest friend. They were in Cub Scouts together.","Great, Its under here as Security Guard home."
I'll get started on the blood tests.,"You haven't been a real doctor in ten years, you'll make a mess all over the sheet.",Well pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
You have clinic duty. I still know how to handle a Patient.,Get me blood. Lots of blood.,Youre a patient young lady.
Get me blood. Lots of blood.,They're better. They've showered.,DRAW SOME BLOOD!
"His PTT is prolonged, the fibrin split products are off, he's not clotting properly. It looks like a mild case of DIC.","Well, obviously not that mild.",Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. Whats KBB?
All this from falling off my roof!,"Yeah, if only he'd fallen on his head. Then he wouldn't have any of these symptoms.","And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!"
We need something stronger than heparin. HuMan activated protein C.,"Looks like Cuddy, same cleavage. Protein C is indiCated only for sEvere sepsis.","Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunkydory."
"Well, how Many of his limbs have to be at stake, for it to be sEvere?","But this stuff is crazy dangerous. It can cause internal bleeding. If he bleeds, he could stroke, he could die.",How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
He could get better.,"You know, if I tried a scheme like this, you'd give me that nasty, wrinkly face and screech like a hyena.","No. Im not a lawyer, but I dont think this is the place to do this."
"It's very sexy, I admit. Do it.",Protein C is border-line irresponsible. 'Cept that the safe stuff isn't doing squat.,My husband would tell you to go for it.
This is exactly the type of thing you would do.,"Well, obviously.",That sounds like something you would do.
You were just jerking Cuddy around?,You seriously thought I wanted to stop her?,"No, I was um."
One thing Cuddy is not is clueless.,"No, first causality of this case is her sense of humor.","No one likes a knowitall, Penny."
"His fingers are Even darker, his temperature is 102 and spiking, and the x-ray now shows lung infiltrates.",The good news is he won't be bitParkng about losing his hand if he can't breathe.,"Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it."
The trauma from the fall could cause actuate respiratory distress syndrome.,"Right, I forgot. Your roof.",He slipped and fell.
It would cause lung infiltrates and maybe fEver and conceivably the cyanotic fingers.,The only question is why?,You could die.
The only question is why? Why what?,Why her weird psychopathology requires a diagnosis formed entirely by personal guilt.,Why in the name of all the Gods
Pneumonia doesn't hit that fast.,"Sure, only pavement hits that fast. It's not pneumonia. Might have missed a finger turning dark, he's not going to miss breathing pRoblems. What else?","Uh, yknow, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold."
It's pneumonia. He wanted to go home. I thought he was lying. I told him I had a dinner party. I made him go up there.,"Well, why didn't you just take out a gun and shoot him?",And how can we make him feel better?
I thought it was just asthma.,"Might have mentioned this earlier, Doctor. Maybe we could have sent some blood cultures to the lab, instead of wasting a day indulging your self-loathing.","Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?"
"If it's just garden-variety bacterial pneumonia, he's gonna be fine.",So give him garden-variety Levaquin and a garden-variety echo-cardiogram. And go check out the kid's House.,Thats kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.
"The blood work will show us which type of pneumonia it is, if","If he's huffing nail polish, or pulling the wings off his pet parrot, this way will be faster.","But, I mean, do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?"
It's Alfredo. And I can handle getting a key and,Rico and I no longer trust you deciding what's important and what's not.,"Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?"
You Ever think about writing a book on office politics?,Trust me. It would be a lot worse if I told her you have to break into her House.,Do you have any idea how to run an office?
"Wait, wait, wait. Cuddy's House?","See, it is shocking. Guy's been working there Every day for the last three weeks. Do you think it's impossible that he could have picked something up?","Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff."
I'm not breaking into my boss's House.,I'm your boss.,Then dont break in!
She's scarier than you are.,"Oh, she's a Woman. Relax, I'm coming with.",Im sorry. She scares me.
"No, nothing wrong with that.",What do you think? Red thongs? I think red thongs. 'Kay!,"No. Its okay. If were friends, we should be able to talk about anything."
What do you think? Red thongs? I think red thongs. 'Kay!,Twenty bucks says I can get through this door in twenty seconds.,"Hey, hey! You said youre gonna wear a thong, wheres the thong?"
So how did you know about her key? You been doing a little handyMan work for Cuddy yourself?,Someone as obsessive and insecure as Cuddy pRobably has three extra keys hidden within ten feet of the door.,"You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?"
"Oh, and you consider obsession a negative quality?","Insecticide is organic, soap is hypoallergenic.",I take issue with the word compulsive.
"Insecticide is organic, soap is hypoallergenic.",I got the bedroom.,"Good point, but, thought of that already."
I got the bedroom.,This is where it all happens.,I got you your own room.
There's no way you deduced where that key was.,Does this count as red?,The key is hidden in my room.
"You gave yourself twenty seconds, then put money on it.",Oh my God. She's got pictures of you in here.,Twenty seconds to go time.
Oh my God. She's got pictures of you in here.,Just you. It's like some kind of weird shrine.,"Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is."
It's like some kind of weird shrine. You're kidding.,Yeah.,"You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid?"
You're kidding. Yeah.,She uses super tampons. What does that mean?,"Youre kidding me, right?"
You two are just too nasty to each other not to have been!nasty.,"Hey, I can be a jerk to people I haven't slept with. I am that good.","Really stupid. And I dont even know how it happened. Im sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?"
There's nothing here. Are you ready to go or you got some more stuff you want to sniff?,Whoa. Check this out. It's fuzzy. It's black. It's alive.,You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.
Patient's lung function is declining rapidly. Levaquin's not working. He obviously doesn't have garden-variety pneumonia.,I'm glad you learned to take his impending death in stride.,"Yes, but I dont wanna die in your cab!"
Guess what he does have. Rats.,Scars on his hand!,You cant keep a rat in your appartment!
Scars on his hand! Rat bites.,But he says they're from construction work so he won't have to admit he's got rats in the home. Catholics are right. Pride will kill you.,"Aw! You guys. Hes licking on my finger, just like my cat does."
Rat bite fEver.,"Boogy, oggy, oogy.","Oh God, Rabies?"
It fits the symptoms perfectly.,It's certainly one possibility. What about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink?,"Well it does when you combine it with, This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
What about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink? What sink?,You ought to clean your bathroom better.,"Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl."
You broke into my House?,"No, that would be wrong. I had a key.",How did you get into my apartment?
Oh damn. You're right. The focal consolidation makes fungal pneumonia far more likely.,"You're right I'm right. On the bright side, it has the advantage of keeping you totally responsible.",One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Yeah. Your point being?,Going the dangerous and aggressive route didn't work last time. It's bound to work this time. Start him on the amphotericin.,Im just saying that I think I agree with your point.
He falls off your roof and you don't come to see him once? Bitch.,With a Patient.,Hell figure it out when he falls off the roof.
Not according to the log.,It's three-fifteen.,Dont worry about that.
How's Cuddy doing?,She's not acting like Cuddy. It's a pleasure.,Mmm. Hows Leonard doing?
"You know her. She has trouble with these situations, feels personally responsible.",Technical term is narcissism. You can't beliEve Everything is your fault unless you also beliEve you're all-powerful.,How do you even know a woman like that?
"sarcastic Wow, doesn't she sound messed up.",I don't beliEve I can fix Everything. I don't lie awake at night tormented by that fact.,"Yknow what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke shes trying to play on him."
"No, you lie awake tormented by",We were talking about Cuddy here.,And if this is a dream I will kill the man who tries to wake me.
We were talking about Cuddy here. She cares.,She enjoys feeling guilty.,Correction we dont care.
"Lisacares. It's why she drives you nuts. 'Cause it's not just a puzzle to her. The Patients are actually real, their feeling actually relevant. And I'm telling her, she can't Even talk to him.","My God, it's contagious. You're feeling guilty, too.",Amys lab. She is dissecting a brain.
I'm just saying take it easy on her. You owe her that.,Commercial's over.,"Honestly, I think you should go easy on her."
So glad we talked.,"Snap, crackle, pop. Got some Rice Crispies in there?",Im glad we had this little talk.
"That bad, huh?","You were here yesterday. I see from the chart that Dr. Foreman prescribed medicine, not a miracle. Got to give this stuff more than a day.",This friend of mine lets call her Noelle she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York.
I didn't fill that Oreo's prescription.,"On the theory that you didn't trust him because he's black!well, I'm going to prescribe the same medicine. See if you fill it this time.","Penny, theres only one cookie with something in the middle that solves lifes problems, and thats an Oreo."
"I'm not buying into no racist drug, okay?","It's racist because it helps black people more than white people? Well, on behalf of my peeps, let me say, thanks for dying on principle for us.",Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.
"Look. My heart's red, your heart's red. And it don't make no sense to give us different drugs.","You know, I have found a difference. Admittedly, it's a limited sample, but it's my experience in the last ninety seconds that all black people are morons. Sorry, African-Americans.",And I think its nice that youre taking whatever medication Amys clearly giving you.
I'll see another doctor.,Fine. Fine.,"Uhhuh, me too."
I'll see another doctor. Fine. Fine.,I'll give you the same medicine we give Republicans.,I called the doctor like a week ago.
I think he's dying. Dying?,"Geez, it's the cops.",ls he dead?
Muriendo? Mi hijo esta muriendo? Dying? My son is dying?,Guess she understands a little English.,This is your home.
Proof that my brilliant idea of giving him amphotericin is killing him.,That wasn't a complete waste of time. His reaction shows that you don't need to clean under your sink. It wasn't aspergilllus.,"See, Ive known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain."
And blood cultures show he was negative for rat bite fEver.,There's still plenty of other cool pneumonias!,Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side.
"No, his antigen is negative.","Well, that all sucks!","Yes, he is."
DIC wouldn't cause a fEver this high.,See my lapdog agrees with me. How high?,I had a hundred and one fever.
"Two hours ago, it was one-oh-three. With acetaminophen.",What about on St. Alban's Day? Only temperature I'm interested in right now is his temperature right now.,"Whoa.

"No, I feel better.",It really doesn't hurt? Or you just figure if you say no you'll get out of the hospital sooner?,No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
Doesn't hurt. Feels good.,You don't smell too hot.,Does it feel good?
You don't smell too hot.,Your hand is starting to rot.,"Well no, I dont smell anything."
Your hand is starting to rot.,Why are we here?,Youve lost a hand.
We're talking about cutting off a kid's hand.,"Yes, we're talking about cutting it off, not subdividing it and putting in condos. It's not a legal issue.","If Im going to jail, Im killing him, not breaking his thumb."
Are you being intentionally dense?,Huh?,"No, stop being stupid."
I've heard enough.,What? She says one word and you take her side. You should wait until she at least gives a medical reason. Otherwise I might take it personally.,"Wait, no, no, no, stop."
All of his symptoms are caused by his underlying pRoblem and the medicine we gave him.,What underlying pRoblem? You have no idea what the underlying pRoblem is.,This lot wont be here long.
You're the diagnostician.,Fine. It's all my fault. Does that make you feel better?,"Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair."
His hand still has an arterial pulse.,His hand is a cesspool. And the crap is spreading.,"I dont know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom."
You are being pretty aggressive about destroying a Man's livelihood.,Don't give a damn about his livelihood.,This is violent and offensive.

"He loses his home, his kid brother drops out!",American dream destroyed.,What happens to the boys?
"American dream destroyed. Very sad, very emotional. Not one medical fact in the whole pathetic tale. You've lost perspective, Cuddy. You've stopped looking at this as a doctor. You're acting like someone who shoved somebody off their roof. You want to make things right? Too bad. Nothing's Ever right.","I'm happy to report that we're now so in synch we're actually wearing each other's underwear. Chop, chop time.","Wow. That is... That is a great story. Thats the American Dream right there, right?"
Is this true?,"No, I'm lying. Stupid to do with her in the room, I guess.",Are you guys sure about this?
This is a big decision.,We made it.,We need you to make a decision.
We should convene in a meeting of the ethics committee.,NO! throws hands up. Look. She is making a medical decision based on nEver wanting to feel regret. You're making a legal decision on wanting me to be wrong.,"Thanks Michael. Today were going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired."
"Greg, you have a history of","You wanted superficial agreement. You wanted Everybody's asses covered. You got it. Now can I do the surgery? Pretty, pretty please?","Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times."
I gave one of my clinic Patients a follow up call. Your name came up.,I'm guessing an old black guy that thinks the CIA invented rap music to make your people want to kill each other.,You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
He says you gave him the white folks' stuff. This is exactly why black people don't live as long.,This isn't about race. Unless annoying is a race. Is he not getting better?,"OK. Im sorry. Im sorry. Hes ruin... Hes butchering it. Could you just let me... Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... I take care of my kid!"

"Oh, relax, Foreman. He already is.",I told him it was the white stuff. I gave him the black stuff.,"Aw, hes already taking after Uncle Shelly."
He was right. You did exactly what white people do. You figure we don't need to know the truth or can't understand it. So you just lie to us.,It's just a white lie.,Dont be oversensitive.
"Good one, Master.","Right, I'm a racist. Too bad that idiot will nEver know for the rest of his long, long life.",Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
He needs a ventilator. And dialysis.,"I'm getting distracted by the multi-system organ failure. Pinkies are supposed to be pink, right? They're not called grayies.","No, no you dont understand the animal hospital is way across town hes choking I dont know what else to do."
But the organ failure is gonna kill him.,But the pinky is weirder!sits up What does it tell us?,What if he doesnt survive?
Same thing the right hand told us before we cut it off. It's the same symptom.,But at a different time.,"No, no, no, no."
"Well, the lack of DIC would explain Everything if there were also a lack of anything to explain.",Endocarditis. His heart's infected.,Maybe we dont need to understand any more than that.
Endocarditis. His heart's infected.,Little bacteria cauliflowers clinging to his bowels.,Joey and Rachels apartment.
It's perfect. Except for the little fact that we're already tested for endocarditis and he was negative.,Which either means he is negative or what infection could cause pneumonia and culture negative for endocarditis? Prize value goes down with Every clue.,"Honey, weve been trying to have a baby for over a year."
You're thinking psittacosis? Alfredo doesn't have any pet parrots.,Which are squawking. Give him doxycycline.,"Oh, not my parrot."
No! That will just make his clotting pRoblem worse.,I liked you better when you were coming up with wacky drugs for us to try.,No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.
"If you're wrong, he'll end up with no hands and no feet.","Technically, if I'm wrong, he'll end up dead. But I take your point. What's his night job?","Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
He cleans up at some fast food joint. Why? Do you think he got it from a Parkcken nugget?,Since when do fast food joints allow twelve-year-olds to mop floors?,"Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division."

"Well, because, she'd want to talk to me.",Dgame! Tell me!,"Ok, I mean, I could talk to her."

The fact it doesn't fit your theory doesn't make it a lie.,"When she was out of the room, the kid brother insisted he was going to cover for Alfredo at work tonight.",Achhh. Its always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. Except with you.
"When she was out of the room, the kid brother insisted he was going to cover for Alfredo at work tonight.",Que hace Alfredo los sbados por la noche? What does Alfredo do on Saturday nights?,Im actually glad Lucy had to work tonight.

Yo no se! I don't know!,Give her the talking juice.,"No, I dont know."

I nEver figured it out at all.,Hello.,"I absolutely dont understand, either."
What do you want House?,"if you're wallowing in self loathing, I've got something that might help.","And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression."

Kid's gonna be just fine. Cuddy.,"Your guilt. It's perverse, and it makes you a crappy doctor. It also makes you okay at what you do.",Shes gonna be okay theyre gonna let me take her home.
You figure a perverted sense of guilt makes me a good boss?,Now would the world be a better place if people nEver felt guilty?,That doesnt make you a boss.

"If you did, you nEver would have hired me.",You're not happy unless things are just right. Which means two things. You're a good boss. And you'll nEver be happy.,I dont. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.
You're not happy unless things are just right. Which means two things. You're a good boss. And you'll nEver be happy.,"By the way, why does Everybody think you and I had sex? Think there could be something to it? I don't know.","I know. Its just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I dont know, I dont know if I want, um, I dont know if I want this."
Cuddy feels guilty about not diagnosing psittacosis.,Think so?,I think he feels bad.
There's no way she could have.,No. No way she could have.,I cannot believe her.
No. No way she could have.,It's raining.,"No, she wouldnt."

Ironic close-up on Sebastian's face!and credits!",Selling subscriptions? I heard twenty and you get a new bike.,The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
Dr. Sebastian Charles collapsed during a presentation at Stoia Tucker.,Really? Crushed under the weight of his own ego?,"A hospital hallway, Chandler is sitting on a gurney with his hands spread out behind his back."
Wow. Is there nobody you admire?,"Well, there was this gal I met in 'Nam who could blow out a candle without using her",Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you dont?
He thinks it's TB. She hands him a chart.,Good thing he's not the syphilis expert.,She made him a chore chart.
He wants a second opinion.,Second to his own. Okay. Closes chart It's not TB.,He wants to see I.
What is it?,"Oh, you want specifics?",Weve seen you do that character before though.
"No. He died last month. Stupidly tried to share his meds with his cousin and they only had enough for one. House enters. Dr. House, I'm Sebastian Charles. He offers his hand, which House walks right by.",Patients aren't usually part of the diagnostic process.,"No, hes in prison."
"Every minute, four people die of TB.","writing on the board Wow, how can you sleep at night?",It kills over one americans every year.
There're people dying in Africa of a disease that we cured over,"Yeah, I know.",Like the Black Death and Europe.
"No, thanks, I'll stay. I'd like to hear the differential.","Dr. Cameron, tell the doctor why it's not a good idea for the Patient to be here.",No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
He's an immunologist and a TB expert.,"That'll be very useful if we need somebody to say the words, I think it's TB. He sniffs. What is that?",When? When did he tell you? Today?
"Oh that. I'm sorry, that's my body powder. It's the only thing I've found that works in the Sahara. I, I'm kind of used to it, I don't Even notice it.",Who thinks it smells like an elephant dung smoothie?,"Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?"
It smells okay to me. Sebastian laughs.,That is exactly why the Patient shouldn't be in the room.,"Oh, it smells good in here."
He's not an idiot.,"Sure, you say that now, while he's in the room.",He is not an idiot!
"Look, I don't have time for this. It's TB.",Nope. The symptoms are too varied.,"Okay, I dont have time for this he saidshe said."
"Well, if you haven't seen 10,000 cases I'd agree that's what you'd think.",Told you he's an idiot. You said you wanted a second opinion.,"Well, thats because of a lot of"
"No, actually. My backers wanted a second opinion.","Yeah, doesn't look good if you drop dead while wearing your shoes sponsor's logo.",So I cant question your decisions anymore?
"It's TB, and I'm not dying. I'm going to want you to plan a PPD and induce sputum to confirm the TB. House nods to Chase and Foreman, who stand up. Sebastian follows. Imaging studies will determine the progress, and I think we should pRobably take a CT-scan of my lungs just so that nobody second-guesses us?",Wouldn't want that. Sebastian's cell rings. He answers it.,My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
smiling very broadly I should go.,"The nameless poor have a face, and it's a pompous white Man. Cameron enters.","Okay, good. I think Im gonna go."
What's the emergency?,"looking at his yo-yo I can't remember how to do Walk the Dog. The guy's sick, he may be dying. We've forgotten all about doing a differential diagnosis.","Ugh! I dont know what Im going to do! I called the company that sent and ththey dont care! Then I called 911 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?"
You just sent us off to test him for,I had to get him out of there. Now we can all sit around and call him an idiot. Who wants to go first?,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
He's right! Tuberculosis could present in hundreds of different ways!,"Well, by that logic, Everyone in the hospital should be treated.",All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area.
Not Everyone in the hospital's been exposed to it for the last 20 years.,"TB takes years to kill you. Two weeks ago he was perfectly healthy, now he's got a white board full of symptoms.","Well, Ive been doing some research and Ive learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia."

What about his heart?,Obviously big as all out doors.,"Well, his heart was in the right place."
Abnormal heart rhythm. White form showed P-R variability.,"It's subtle, but it's there.","What can I say, you missed your chance."
You think it's his heart? Sick sinus syndrome?,"Loose throttle. Sometimes beats too fast, sometimes too slow.",Is he puffing out his chest?
It would account for the episode. I'll put him on telemetry do a stress test and an echocardiogram.,"Treat him like Every other hospital Patient. I want to see that pious, body powered toosh hanging out of his gown.",Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!

"He cures thousands of people Every year, you cure, what? 30?",McDonald's makes a better hamburger than your mother because they make more?,"Hey, isnt that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year?"
"Oh, I see! So you hate him because the lives he saves aren't as good as the lives you save.","Yup, that's the reason. Nobel invented dynamite. I won't accept his blood money.","Im sorry I said that, I didnt."

"Hey, stress test was normal.",But his EKG was not normal.,"I dont know, Im not used to the stress."
But his EKG was not normal. Echo's normal.,"Two for you, one for me. We need a tie-breaker.",But his mind is sound?
Echo and stress test are more reliable.,Tilt-table test.,"Yes, well I want to stress test it."
Tilt-table test. NEver works.,Bet you a week's clinic duty it does.,And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight.
"Hah hah, you're on.",You like this guy? And up.,I think youre on.
You always tell us our opinion of the Patient is irrelevant.,"Medically, it's irrelevant. Down. That says something about you. Up.","Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments."
You figure that anybody that gives a crap about people in Africa must be full of it?,Yes.,A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa.
"Hmmm. So, the great huManitarian's as selfish as the rest of us.",Just not as honest about it.,Maybe Joeys right.
"You also always tell us motives are irrelevant. And Sebastian is still going up! Dr. Charles, your heart's handling the changes in orientation just fine. No pauses on your EKG. And House drives up for the lay-up and oh, rejected! Heh, those doctors and those sports metaphors.",What does this knobby thing do?,"The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard."
I'm within protocol range you're not going to get a different result.,"The way I figure it is, if this could show you pRoblems at 6, imagine what could happen if you crank it to10.","Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes Maybe this can work."

You were wrong.,"Hey, I have feelings. I'm trying my best. Isn't that enough for you?","Oh, umm, Im just getting rid of a couple of things."
It's not sick sinus syndrome.,"Well, thank God we found out before we put the pacemaker in. And thank God you dragged him into a stairwell to get his heart racing.","True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .."
Why would you say he's selfish?,Because he's been talking to Foreman. The phone rings.,Are you calling me selfish?
"No I haven't, I'm just giving my opinion. This kind of altruism doesn't just naturally",Excellent briefing.,"Uh, I havent."
"Hey, the guy's still sick. Can we talk about that? The headaches point to a neurological pRoblem. Acoustic neuroma. Brian tumour causes dizziness, loss of consciousness, messes with breathing patterns, heart rhythms",Get an MRI.,How does that laugh not give you a headache?
"Yeah, there is.",Did I ask you to plant a PPD?,"Yes, of course there is!"
"It was positive, he's got TB!","Well, of course he's got TB! The guy's been in the jungle for 20 years! If he tested positive for pink-eye would you think that was his big pRoblem?","What? What are you doing with, what?"

"Well, maybe he's not the only stubborn jerk. House does an exaggerated what, me? kind of gesture. I did an LP2 low glucose and he has an increased sed rate. Everything screams tuberculosis!",Not Everything!,He thinks hes such a smarty pants.
If any of the symptoms are caused by the TB it would throw off our diagnosis.,You're right. Got to treat the TB.,"The Airport, Carol and Ross are waiting for Emily and Susan to deplane."
"Who knows, maybe he'll just get better.","You'd like that, wouldn't you? Cameron leaves.","Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday."

So it's all because he's one of them useless specialists?,"Oh, did I hurt the big time oncologist's itty bitty feelings?","What, so he was a little analytical."

"Cecelia Carter, remember her?","Last week they said it was Mystery Stew, they owe me.","I know why I dont remember her, huh?"
That doesn't sound like you!,Then it pRobably wasn't.,"Well, that does not sound like me."
"I get that you like to shock people. Stun them out of complacency, out of stupidity. But this Woman thought she had cancer, she had a lump in her breast!

"You know, Cuddy's only doing this because she thinks it's you.","Welcome to the world. Everyone's different, Everyone gets treated different. You try fighting that, you end up dying of TB. House hits the TV.","Hey, Im sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when shes with you."
What are you doing?,Testing the Patient's autonomic nervous system.,"Yknow I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to"
Testing the Patient's autonomic nervous system. Of course.,"His internal heating and ventilation should be off, shouldn't be able to sweat.","We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder."
"Dr. House, I would appreciate it if you left the room.",He's sweating like a pig.,You may want to leave the room.
"Did they hear me? The media, did they listen?",He's disoriented.,"Ok, are they listening?"
"They, they have to hear me.",His arteries are clamping down. A monitor starts beeping.,Theyre gonna hear us.
"I want Everybody out of here, now!","Get the crash cart, he's having a cardiac arrest! More beeping.",Lets get you out of here!
I've got sinus rhythm.,in the camera's face That is not TB!,I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
Do whatEver tests you want.,I want to treat you for TB. Dr. Cameron found low sugar in your cerebrospinal fluid. It's a classic finding of TB.,"Nothing, theres nothing wrong with you."
And now you think TB's the pRoblem?,"Nah. If TB caused cardiac arrest on a hot day, your work in Africa would be Even more futile than it already is.","Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B."
"Can you get to your point, please?","That white board in my office, we're up to about a dozen symptoms now.","What Im trying to say is that, maybe you cant approach this as a purely intellectual exercise."
I'll take any other tests or treatments you might want to prescribe.,"So you're not special, but TB is.","Yknow, I dont have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical."
"People die of TB because we let them, it's our choice.","People die of malaria because we let them, they die of dysentery","Oh, so youre saying youd choose convenience over health?"
"Nah, TB's my disease.","You own a disease? Well, I'm sorry I missed the IPO on dengue fEver.","Well, I dont want your germs around me."
"Look, I know I have a way about me. I know I piss a lot of people off, and a whole lot more I just annoy. But you're the first person that I've Ever met who I think is actually annoyed by what I do. Do you think I'm not saving any lives, or is that a bad thing?","Right now, I'm just trying to save your life.","Well, look at that, even when Im causing problems, I make the world a better place."
"Or do you just have a pRoblem with hope? House rolls his eyes. You know, the difference between our jobs is not numbers or styles. It's that I know I'm going to fail. Even if I save a million people there's going to be another million. You couldn't handle that. I think you resent anyone who can.",Can't we just agree that you're incredibly annoying?,"Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter."
Why would you do that?,"Because I'm just a mean son of a bitch. House leaves, and Sebastian takes the pills.","Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to."
"Because I'm just a mean son of a bitch. House leaves, and Sebastian takes the pills.","So we still have to explain P-R variability, syncope, headaches, and! low sugar?",Because its all tainted with your betrayal.
You've rerun the test? Yeah.,This is good!,So did you read your evaluation yet?
Good? This is bizarre.,Bizarre is good! Common has hundreds of explanations. Bizarre has hardly any.,"No, no, no, no, this is good."
What else could cause low CSF sugar?,Uh-uh. I get to ask the questions. I've found you look a lot smarter asking the questions than dumbly not answering.,"Tired. Im tired. And I didnt eat enough. And, and, thats all. That was it."
"How could he get high insulin lEvels? We've checked daily blood sugars, all normal!",See how smart she looks? Cause she asked the question.,How did he get so fat?
"And it's not glucagonoma because he has no rash. It's not self-induced because he's not an idiot, and it's not a tumour because the CT and the MRI were both negative.","Which just leaves the tumour. He leaves, they all follow.","So what, youre having a little spat."
Why do you do this? Why do you ignore what I say like I'm not Even,"Small tumour. Really, really tiny. So small we can't see it. Nesidioblastoma.",Why do I bother talking to you?
It only intermittently secretes insulin.,"It responds to stress. Like if, oh, I don't know, if someone accidentally puts the mechanical bull on11. They pile into the elevator. Easily removed by surgery.",Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. Im a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?
"Except, if it's so small we can't see it, how're we Even going to prove it's there?","She asked, looking clEver.","Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant."
We just start hacking away at his pancreas until he gets better?,How do you prove something exists when you can't see it? Does God exist? Does the wind blow?,"Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonards faulty digestive system?"
We know because the leaves move.,"Look for effects. They get out of the elevator, where Cuddy and Cecelia are moving toward them.","Trick question! Cause you cant always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?"
"Uh, we should look the other way. It's Cuddy with your Patient.",Dr. House has an emergency.,"Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip?"
We can't avoid her forEver.,Eventually she'll die. You sure she doesn't have breast cancer?,We need to stop her!
Eventually she'll die. You sure she doesn't have breast cancer?,"We think you have a tumour, easily removed surgically. We're going to poke it with a stick.","In my experience, girls like her dont live very long."
And if there's no tumour?,"Nothing happens. Splenic artery, it's a hard left off the celiac. Chase goes for the artery.",Ive been ready to die for many years.
If there is a tumor?,What usually happens when you poke something with a stick? It pokes back.,"Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washedup experimental physicist."
He's stuck in the superior mesenteric.,I knew we should have stopped for directions. Men.,"Uhoh, hes stuck in an infinite loop."
Men. I'm there.,We're going to inject calcium into your pancreas.,Hey. Where are the guys?
How do we know it won't go too low?,Fingers and toes crossed.to Chase Go ahead. Chase injects the calcium. CGI shot of it entering the artery.,And what are we supposed to do until then?
Glucose is holding steady at 75.,No leaves rustling. Blow harder.,I always set it at 69.
I already gave him 1 amp.,"Well, I guess now would be the time to give him more than 1 amp. CGI of more calcium entering.",Look I gave him a six foot extension cord so he cant chase us.
I'm going to start him on a glucose drip. He's going to seize,Not yet.,And dont let him go on Space Mountain after he eats.
He's continuing to drop.,Not fast enough. Monitor beeps.,Hes a dropper!
"He's at 40, 38, 35!Monitor gets to 30, before --","Push an amp of D-50, you want to kill the guy? CGI of the meds entering the system.","Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?"
We're back to 40.,"Congratulations, you have a tumor.",Its like the 40s again.
"Congratulations, you have a tumor.",Are you going to go out with him?,It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Is that any of your business?,Nope.,Thats none of your damn business.
I don't think so.,Two days ago you were holding his hand. What's changed?,"One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
"He practically lives in Africa, there's no future.","On the other hand, maybe there's too much of a future now.",We can have any future you want.
Right. It's that simple.,That was simple?,"Youre right, it is simple."
I put a label on them and go from there.,Everybody does it. We are who people think we are. People think he's a great doctor so they give him stuff.,"There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency."
He is a great doctor.,The reality is irrelevant.,Hes a very nice man.
"He enters the clinic, and walks by Cecelia, deliberately leaning his cane on her boot. Ow!","Oh, my goodness, are you okay?","The Hallway, Monica is returning, but before she enters the apartment she stops on the step and changes from wearing tennis shoes to the boots and she moans in pain as she puts each boot on."
Yeah. Cuddy comes to her door.,"exaggerated, toward CuddyI am so sorry. It was completely my fault.",Kind of. Shes coming by to interview us and see where we live.
"It's nothing, I'm fine.","Well, I'm very reliEved, I feel terrible.","Nothing, Im fine."
"Don't worry about it, I'm fine.","You sure? Okay. They shake hands. Cuddy and House make faces at each other. As House leaves, Cuddy walks through her office door to Cecelia.","The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about his first night with Carol."
"Thank you, thank you, I appreciate that. I appreciate the support.","It's not about the kids dying Every 8 seconds, it's about the media stroking. Adulation and pats on the head.","And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do."
"That's your pRoblem with him, isn't it?","Look at him, he loves it. Eats it up.",Dont you try and blame this on him.
"Yeah, the Man actually enjoys what he does. Pointed look.","Listen, I saved his life. That means I get credit for Every life he saves from here on out.","I cant hear what hes saying, but he looks like hes really into it."
"No, MRI showed no white matter lesions, and the shocks aren't accompanied by neck flexing.",Good morning!,"No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. Its like the devils cursive."
It's almost noon.,Really? That must be why I'm so hungry. Who's up for lunch?,Its six thirty in the morning.
What's with the jacket?,"poses It keeps me warm, and cool. How does it know?","Oh, for crying out loud."
We're discussing your new Patient.,"Must be a boring discussion, considering that I haven't accepted a new Patient.","Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isnt Ma?"
You accepted him the moment I loaned you five grand.,"Oh, wait, wait, when I said I'd do anything for the money, obviously I didn't mean it.","Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? IIII cant. I couldnt even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade."
"Bad night at poker, or great night with a hooker?",Thank you for saving me the trouble of deflecting that personal question with a joke.,"Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?"
"Been there done that, also ruled out cancer, MS, pyridoxine toxicity, and all the popular neuropathies.",sighs Cervical spondylosis?,No. Sulfites. Migraines.
Doesn't explain the low white count.,"He's black, I'm assuming he's not just really dirty, but is of African descent. Which means he'd have a lower white count.",Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door?
Not this low.,"He's a wrestler, pRobably uses diuretics to cut weight, can also cause low white count.","OK, our prices have never been lower."
Not this low.,Mockingly Not this low. Tieshets??.,Higher or lower than what?
No external outbreak.,Something's missing. Find out what it is. Tosses the chart on the table in front of the ducklings.,Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
"Uh, I don't Even know what that means.","Well figure it out, find it out, and then find me, I'll be at lunch.",Do you even know what that means?
"Well this, this is perfect.","Invite me to dinner Thursday night. Wilson looks blankly at him Come on we haven't had a nice meal together since, oh!","Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties."
Yesterday when I loaned you five thousand dollars to buy a new car. Points at the bike,"tosses his cane up in the air and catches it near the top, then hands it over to Wilson My treat. House limps over to the bike",Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
"Two-wheeled vehicles that travel 150 miles an hour don't really go well with crippled, irresponsible, drug addicts.",Actually two-wheeled vehicles that go 180 miles an hour do not go well with healthy responsible arParktects who don't know how to separate breaking and turning.,No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
You're taking it back.,Mock whining Moooom! How about we talk about this over dinner.,"Alright here you go, take it back!"
"Forget dinner, you're going to kill yourself! Nice bike!","Thank you. See that's how you do it, compliments, dinner.","Okay, but if you cantno dinner!"
What do you do with your cane?,"If he buys me dinner, he'll find out.",You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
"We went though all the imaging studies, and re-did blood cultures.",I don't want hand-me-downs. I want brand new stuff.,Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
Well there's nothing House revs the engine louder There's nothing!House revs the engine again.,Sorry I didn't catch that last part!,"Knock, knock, knock, Penny?"
"There's nothing Engine revs again, Foreman gives up and stops speaking and House stops revving the engine. Everyone including Wilson starts to smile, Foreman tries again There's nothing else we can do.",You checked the police report?,"Mr. Cooper, theres nothing"
You checked the police report? On what?,On his mom's car accident.,Did the police solve the problem with the.
"It was 15 years ago, the kid wasn't Even in the car",She veered off a straight dry road in broad daylight. That doesn't seem odd to you?,"When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You dont blame the child."
She pRobably got distracted changing radio stations or something.,"That's what the police thought. Of course, they didn't know that she has a family member who is frequently incapacitated by shock-like sensations","Thank you, Mr."
Genetic component seems unlikely,It's interesting. Type 2 neurofibromatosis could cause the shocks.,"Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?"
You knew this was missing?,"shrugs I knew something was missing. Maybe this, maybe something else. Get a DNA analysis of the long arm of chromosome 22","All right, uh Oh hey, youve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
"shrugs I knew something was missing. Maybe this, maybe something else. Get a DNA analysis of the long arm of chromosome 22",You'd rather have dinner with your wife?,You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there?
"Yes, I would. If she were speaking to me.","smiles Unlike her, I could make it worth your while leers",Would you talk to her?
"smiles Unlike her, I could make it worth your while leers Fine.",Should I drive?,"Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her."
Not if you had the stool sample which was negative for botulinism.,He lied to his son about how his mom died? takes a Vicodin,"Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?"
He was just protecting him,Manipulating him.,No man could have protected him from himself.
It's what parents do.,They lie to us because they love us. Who's getting teary?,"Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children."
"Mom's death is irrelevant. DNA rEvealed no NF2 markers or any other inherited disease. Apparently, she really did fall asleep at the wheel.","SO, what exactly are we talking about here? A little peeker, or did the prairie dog actually come out to play?","Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her."
"A little peeker, or did the prairie dog actually come out to play? Excuse me?",Are we talking explosive?,Is there a puppy here?
"The haemacel was negative for blood, and I wouldn't say he actually exploded. More like... gushed?","Good, now we're getting somewhere checks the caller ID","Ah, so then his plane didnt explode in a big ball of fire?"
"Good, now we're getting somewhere checks the caller ID Yeah? Where?",I have no idea picks up the phone Hello?,I dont know where the phone is.
Of course! The riddles.,Hi mom!,Do you like brain teasers?
Who was that?,"Angelina Jolie. I call her mom. Who thinks that's sexy? turns back to the whiteboard So, explosive or gushing...","No, Eddie likes to keep it over there."
"She nEver calls you, is Everything okay?","Great, yeah. My dad's taking her to Europe, they got a nine-hour layover in Newark on Thursday. If it's gastrointestinal...",No I didnt want her to call because I thought it would be weird.
You lied to avoid seeing your own mom.,Are you kidding?,I went to see your mom.
"Transverse myelitis. Could cause numbness, anal sphincter dysfunction, and the shocks.","Thank you for taking no interest in my mother. But that begs the question, what caused the transverse myelitis?",What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
Maybe the infection's gone but the memory remains,"Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin lEvel and an electrophoresis","Well, her memory is pretty much gone."
"Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin lEvel and an electrophoresis","talking to the symptoms on the whiteboard You're good my friend, I'm sure we'll meet again.","I dont know, you guys work in the same lab."
"Yeah, I know. It's not that it's...",Are these people completely incapable of telling the truth to each other?,"I know, and theres no excuse for that."
He went to Jamaica with his friends.,sighs No wonder he lied. Parkldren aren't supposed to have good times.,"I dont know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michaels way into Photoshop."
"One of his friends flew them down. Carnell's dad has this thing about him accepting stuff from rich friends. Wants him to remember who he is, where he came from.",Where have you been?,Gotta catch a plane.
Making dinner plans. What's up?,The boys have uncovered the shocking fact that the Patient has a crappy relationship with his dad.,"So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?"
They seem to actually care,Well I don't. There's only one reason any kid with a plane flies to Jamaica.,Are they? I didnt know I cared that much.
It wasn't for marijuana. He doesn't do anything but drink,He say that to you or his pops?,But you said you forgave me.
Tox screen was negative for THC,"thoughtful Spring break was over a month ago, Even pot would have washed out by now","Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled."
"Even if he'd smoked, no way marijuana causes transverse myelitis",True. But the stuff they put on it does.,"Before I answer, was he a smoker?"
Well you wouldn't necessarily have to smoke to get pesticide poisoning. He could have eaten fruit that had been sprayed or been exposed to his skin on a hike.,Or he could have smoked it.,Dont be silly.
You have no evidence to support a poisoning diagnosis.,Which is why it's going to be so cool when I turn out to be right.,"Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy."
Which is why it's going to be so cool when I turn out to be right.,"Cameron, who were you making dinner plans with?","Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually."
looking very innocent No one. House doesn't look convinced,You bastard! Wilson turns around and sees House You invited my parents to dinner.,Michaels up on the roof and hes acting strange!
Geez Cameron's got a big mouth!,Hah! Not as big as yours!,Quiet down will ya!
Hey! You used me to avoid seeing your parents.,Well what do you care?,Those your parents?
"I don't, I just thought it might be interesting to find out why.",You could have just asked.,I dont its just.
You would have lied!,And you would have beliEved me! Which would have kept us both happy. Wilson looks utterly confused You want your money back? Is this what this is about?,"Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you."
If you have the money then why did you need the loan?,I didn't.,No! Were not borrowing money.
dumbfounded You're splutters you're trying to... objectively measure how much I value our friendship?!,"Hey, it's 5 grand.",I am speachless.
"takes the cheque and puts it in his wallet Fine. Thanks. Now, be a grown-up and either tell mommy and daddy you don't want to see them, or I'm picking you up at 7 for dinner gets into his car",shocked What do you mean? You just said that--,And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
laughing He's got his appetite back! WhatEver you did is working.,"He's healthy, so all is forgiven. Now I'm feeling nauseous.",I am so happy youre eating again.
looking at Carnell's files He is not healthy. Nausea and diarrhoea were not his only symptoms!,The shocks have also decreased,It seems he had some trouble on the road.
But not disappeared.,"And he's out of the diaper, which is good news for Everyone.",What do you mean they left?
What about his low white count?,The little buggers need time to grow.,And hes all white.
puts down the phone What happened?,Apparently I can save money by switParkng to another long-distance carrier.,Who let this boy on the phone?
"Oh I was right, wasn't I?","Oh yeah, it's always about you isn't it?","Oh, I kinda was, wasnt I?"
What's that mean? I mean... what's happening?,You want the truth? Or you want me to make something up to protect you? We think a drunk driver broke into his room.,I cant believe Rachel just moved on and didnt say anything to me
angry What's happening to my son!,The truth is... I have no idea.,"Im sorry! Heyhey Joe, why dont you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!"
The truth is... I have no idea.,There's the fEver that Cameron was looking for,"Dude, I dont know."
We knew if it was myelitis there had to be an itis. This must be the infection that set it off.,"Yeah, except in this universe, effect follows cause. I've complained about it, but--","Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you."
Maybe the tests were wrong,"No, the tests were right. Yesterday he had no fEver, no infection.",You performed experiments on living men.
So he just happened to catch a bug while he was here? That's all this is?,"Yeah. Because his white blood cell count was down he was vulnerable, because it's really down it might kill him. That's ALL this is. Is he still pooping his pants?",Hmm. Who knows? Thats exciting. Ill get to wake up every morning and see if hes still here.
He just started again.,Again?,He can begin again.
It stopped when he was getting better.,"He was feeling better, he was nEver getting better.",The next year he really stepped things up.
And we need to find an answer before this infection kills him.,That would be the ideal.,"Well, we have gotta find out if hes alive."
What do you want?,To apologise.,Then Im going with you.
The clinic's closed at night,"Yeah but I'm sure there's plenty of things to be done, there's charts to be reviewed, supplies inventoried--",This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!
"Yeah but I'm sure there's plenty of things to be done, there's charts to be reviewed, supplies inventoried-- Dinners avoided?",You're going too?,But what about all the plans and the guests?
I love their Cobb salad.,"Give me a reason to get out of this, and I'll tell you who started the rumour about you being a transsexual.",Did you get a chance to try Michaels homemade potato salad?
There is no such rumour.,"There will be, unless you get me out of this dinner.",I thought that was just a rumour.
"No one's making you do this, House, just do what Everybody else does, lie to them.",You lie to your mother?,"Well, its my house, its my rules."
Only since I was twelve!,"My mom's a huMan polygraph. My dad should be taking her to Vegas, not the Louvre.",Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering whats between my legs?
"Trust me, your mom would much rather think you have a business meeting than you hate her.",I don't hate her. I hate him.,"She doesnt hate you, stop saying that."
"I don't know. I took some scrapings, it doesn't appear to be ringworm.",What did it look like? Aside from not ringworm.,This is the bite of a fly.
Any discolouration around the edges?,"Get him in here, we all want to take a look.","Nope, just a little bump on my forehead."
Even if it is Kaposi's it's not related. Our Patient doesn't have any skin symptoms and we've already ruled out cancer.,"What are the odds of two friends who've just returned from a trip outside the country coming down with unexplained, but unrelated illnesses? Get him in here.",. . . as are the rest of her advisors.
"He won't come. Just started a new job after graduation, they're working on some big merger.",Tell him his friend's life hangs in the balance.,Is he quitting his job at the university?
That's what I told him the first time. Still wound up driving into Manhattan.,Tell him his life hangs in the balance. Tell him the rash is flesh-eating and the next course in the menu is his frank and beans.,"Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to?"
But it means the antibiotics aren't working.,Double the dose. And add tygacil to the list.,Just to say sterile doesnt make it so.
Soon as he's out of surgery.,Where's RiParke Rich?,As soon as his God wills it.
He said he can't leave work.,"Yeah, you told me that two hours ago.","So, what do you say?"
I'm not going to lie.,"Why, 'cause it's wrong? Or because you're a coward?","Im not gonna lie to her, either."
"Hmm, tough choice.",You've been wasting 2 hours of the kid's time.,"Make your choice, then."
"Yeah, by vomiting blood. Ambulance is 10 minutes out.",You Taddy?,By drowning or.
You Taddy? What?,Love the name. If I Ever have a dog... take off his pants.,"Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again."
to Cameron Hey.,"Don't talk to her, listen to me",and to King Meredith!
"He's vomited in excess of 3 units of blood, he needs to be admitted before--","You wanted to be a doctor, maybe you should have buckled down a little more in high school takes a pair of scissors and starts cutting up Taddy's pants",And I was thinking its only fair that you help make this decision since theyll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
What are you doing?,Exactly how close were you and Carnell?,"You cant go, I mean youre the glue that holds this group together!"
Not so close.,Spend a lot of time together in Jamaica? Share a room?,"Actually, it wasnt that close."
"Wait, you don't think... look, we're not gay.","Not saying you're gay, I'm saying you had sex. tears the pants open and starts inspecting the rash near Taddy's groin. Fortunately, Taddy's still got his briefs on",And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
"Look we're not gay, we hardly Even hung out.","Right, so you just flew him down to Jamaica because he won a contest.","Not that its any of your business, but we did go out."
"No he's in my frat, all right? Between school and wrestling, and going home Every break to work in his father's junkyard, Carnell didn't have any time to hang out with anybody.",It's not fungus.,"Oh, actually I barely knew him."
I already told you that.,"There's no pustules, it's not Staph... suddenly looks up at Taddy His dad's what?","It has been a long, lonely winter."
His dad owns a scrap metal salvage yard. Carnell worked there during breaks.,You lied.,Hes from that company in Pitts.
What are you talking about?,"Oh, yeah, pRoblems with this family, pRobably need more specifics. You told us you owned a construction company, not a salvage yard.","Another time, Packer held this guys head in the toilet for like a minute."
"I know the way things work, the better my job, the better my son gets treated.",Right. That's why I'm mad. 'Cause we wasted all that filet mignon on you. Did your kid find anything unusual the last time he worked for you?,"Well, yknow what, no, you do not make my decisions because yknow what, youre fired."
Did your kid find anything unusual the last time he worked for you? No.,"Braided wire, metal weights, lead canister, maybe just a lid. PRobably used it as a door stop or paperweight.",Now hes trying to get me to bring my children in to work.
"Why would he want to-- stops mid sentence, long pause","Okay, here it comes",He wants more money.
"I gave him an early graduation gift, old plumb I found. Looks like a fishing weight. Put it on a keychain so he'd always remember where he came from.",So he can lie about it later. Where's the keychain?,"So, what did you get the birthday boy?"
"I don't know. He nEver used it, just kept it as a good luck charm.",Kept it where?,I dont know.
I don't know! Why? Why does it matter?,Where are the kid's clothes?,Why does it matter so much to you?
In the bureau back in his regular room?,gestures at Chase and Foreman You two get it to radiology.,No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
gestures at Chase and Foreman You two get it to radiology. His clothes?,"The bureau. Don't open it. they rush off, he turns to Cameron You come with me.","Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?"
"The bureau. Don't open it. they rush off, he turns to Cameron You come with me.","Set it down there. Now get out of here, this thing is radioactive. he takes a Geiger counter out of the small box and turns it on. Chase runs out","Theres that prostate doctor, but Im still mad at her."
The chances of radiation causing CNS symptoms? Whoa.,Call the boys in the lead pyjamas. Foreman runs out,Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards.
"It might not have caused nerve damage, but it definitely destroyed his immune system.",And caused tumours.,"Well, they said you stepped on its head."
We don't know that. None of the MRIs showed anything.,Do a PET scan. Check his cervical spine. It's not going to be good news.,Youre welcome. Im sorry. Did I hurt you?

Mom. We're early.,gets up and hugs her It's great to see you.,What are you Youre here early.
"We came at a bad time, didn't we?","Actually, yeah. I uh... I have to take a rain check.",No! In the beginning we were not good.
"Aww, plans have been made. Wilson made 'em.","I asked him to cancel. I'm dealing with kind of a compliCated case right now, so...","Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?"
"Well, we'll just come back when things aren't so out of control.",My team is busy.,"So well leave before its over, well be back in time."
You don't want to see us?,"Mom, don't make me feel guilty.",Do you not want to be seen with me?
"No no, of course not! Sorry.",I've got a Patient who's pRobably going to die of radiation poisoning.,"Gee, I wish I could tell you no."
I'll buy you a ruben.,Well I guess I've got time for a sandwich.,Wait! You have to buy me as well.
Well I guess I've got time for a sandwich. smiles Good!,Yeah?,"Thank you. Id like to make a sandwich, but Im out of bread."
I just wanted to let you know that Carnell's prepped for surgery.,Thank you.,"All right. Dont get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and hes getting the surgery right now."
"Really? New, huh?",Nope. Just gullible.,"Youre right, that is new."
"So, besides work, what you been up to?",Not much.,Whatve you been up to?
You always say that. Not much.,It's always the answer.,"Um, not much."
"Leave him alone, John.","Got a new motorcycle. Might have seen it out front, it's orange with a gigantic scrape.","Freeze, give me the list!"

Where's the head?,"turns to his mother Well, good thing we got that cleared up","Its heads. Gentlemen, pick your category."
Oh he was just trying to help.,I don't need help.,"Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped."
The father and the friend are responding well to treatment. Things aren't looking so good for Carnell.,sprawled out on an arm chair and one leg on a foot rest Thank you.,"Shes doing okay, but we just lost another nurse."
It was none of my business.,nods They seem perfectly pleasant don't they?,None of your business.
"Honey, you're wheezing!",Yeah!,I cant breathe!
We need to talk.,Oh god. Are you pregnant? 'Cause I really want to finish high school,"Dont do what I say, say what I do."
You have to renew your credentials!,They're good for two more months,"Hey, youre not permitted in there."
"Three weeks. The paperwork takes forEver. Your application, your malpractice insurance, criminal records check - you know that's going to take some explaining",You know our relationship was way better when we were sleeping together. Why'd we stop doing that? Did you get married?,It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
Yeah! Otherwise I'd be on you like red on rice,Rice isn't r Oh I get it!,Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
You're also behind on your dictations,"I don't do dictations. Cameron does them, or somebody.",I try not to think of it as lagging behind.
You can't have your sole female employee doing your clerical work which you'd know if you'd attended the required sexual harassment seminars. Then I'm going to pause so you can make a crack about harassment.,Joke killer,Check it out.
"House, got a Patient","sighs Sorry, can't play anymore, my mom's calling me walks out of his office","Excellent. Im very hungry. Speaking of which, whats going on with your apartment?"
We just admitted a world class cyclist,You've got to fire Stacy,And we move to the south of France.
"Yeah I'll get right on that deadpan. Jeff Forster, respiratory arrest at 30 miles per hour.",She's loading me up with pointless paperwork,"Meredith, slow down!"
Didn't know you were behind on your pointless paperwork. O2 stats are in the--,She's hostile.,"Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?"
"ER checked for lung infiltrates, nothing there","Professional athletes, Cuddy!",I need your help.
"Oh right, yeah, she's still got a thing for you, making it impossible for her to deal, makes perfect sense. Except for the pronouns!","Anyway, thanks for getting me out of that meeting. Starts to walk away","So, that sounds more like something youd say if you didnt want a relationship with someone."
"Jeff Forster, this is Dr--","I'm a doctor, you're a sick person. Looks at the Manager And you are a loved one","Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica were talking about."
"Actually, Manager. We've been together for sEven years sticks her hand out to shake House's. House looks away and ignores the gesture",So what's the drug du jour on the bike circuit these days? Still erythropoietin? Or are you guys just chugging battery acid?,The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Wheezing as he speaks There's no way I'd touch EPO. Too Many guys stroking out and dying.,"Damn! Looks at Cuddy Ten bucks for the tickets, six for the popcorn",Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction.
I do straight blood doping. Plot twist!,That's a very daring confession, My blood is salt and iron.
"We've got confidentiality, right?",Assuming I'm more ethical than your client.,"Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom."
Assuming I'm more ethical than your client.,"So, injecting yourself with donor red blood cells for fun and profit. Any other tricks up your sleEve?","Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics."
"Well, nothing much recently. I'm in town for a charity ride so it didn't matter if I won. The kids just needed to see me.",So you go slower they see you longer. Let's say that our health could be affected by things we did before last Friday.,"So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?"
"Well... umm, I usually sleep in a hyperbaric chAmber. I've been pumping up electrolytes with an IV drip and herbal supplements, amphetamines, and diuretics","Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but why would you be sick?",You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Dr House is a firm beliEver in good old-fashioned hard work.,"This guy doesn't Even get sick like a regular person. Instead of a list of symptoms and no cause, we have a list of possible causes for one symptom","They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world."
Is the symptom death?,"Respiratory distress. And insanity doesn't cause it, I looked it up.","Youre not dying Hope, youre gonna live a long, healthy life."
"It's the doping. Injecting extra red cells boosts your endurance lEvel, but it also thickens your blood. Thick blood equals clots equals respiratory distress",Not with a clean spiral chest CT,Superheroes take performanceenhancing chemicals?
Guy's sleeping in a hyperbaric chAmber. Over-oxygenation can cause cell damage and if the cells in the lungs are damaged--,That'd cause pulmonary oedema which he doesn't have,What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
Supplements he's been taking contain yojimbo which can cause nerve paralysis,"Tox screen was normal. All the tests were normal. There's no clot, no oedema, and yet he still can't breathe, so there's something in here that we can't see.","Dr. Farber, weve got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer."
"There's no clot, no oedema, and yet he still can't breathe, so there's something in here that we can't see. Oh! Air.",Come to papa!,"Dude, its not breathing."
This guy's been injecting himself how Many times a day? All it'd take is one slip of the needle to cause an air embolus.,"The air is keeping him from breathing air. Let's go with that for the irony. Get a VQ scan, check his veins for bubbles.","Hmm, hes not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, itll just pour out of his nose."
You were right.,Now there were 3 wasted words.,I was right about her.
There is a bubble in his lung. We should do a Swan-Ganz catheterisation.,"I love when you do both sides of the conversation. It's like white noise, it's very peaceful.",We cant just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
Is there a light somewhere that goes on when I have food?,"Green for food, orange for bEverages, red for impure thoughts. That bulb burns out Every 2 weeks.",So the light went out in my refrigerator.
How's your biker?,Pumped an air bubble into a vein in his lung.,Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
"The things people do. Doping, Vicodin... Pointed look",Hey! You're talking about me aren't you?,Drugs ruin lives people.
Hey! You're talking about me aren't you?,I'm just trying to function. He's trying to win himself some little yellow jerseys. The cafeteria door opens to admit Stacy wheeling Mark in on a wheelchair Uh oh.,"Try it, I cant feel a thing!"
The cafeteria door opens to admit Stacy wheeling Mark in on a wheelchair Uh oh. What?,"rubs his forehead Trouble in paradise, 2 o' clock","So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogres DeTech half an hour early so they dont have to sit on the slab."
Your 2 o' clock or my 2 o' clock?,points there.,"Hey, what time is it?"
She looks perfectly happy. Obviously they huddled in the hall and worked up this circus act on the off-chance you'd be in here,She was unbelievably pissy 3 hours ago,She does seem happy.
"Hmm! Pissy with you, happy with her husband. Yes there could only be one possible explanation","When she's angry, she gets sarcastic. When she's annoyed, she's funny, but when she's frustrated, she gets pissy","Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too."
"Yes, yes, I'm with you so far","She's miserable with Mark because he's not me. So she's gotta make me not me, so she makes my professional life miserable, if I can't do my job--","Okay, what? What is too sensitive?"
"You really, really, need to get some--","Oh I get some some all the time, I always need to borrow some money","Oh, Ill go out and get you some."
"Hi James, Greg. Gotten to that paperwork?",I've been pissy.,Did you start the paperwork yet?
I've been pissy. Pardon me?,"I've been busy. Picks up Mark's fork and deliberately eats some of Mark's food off his plate When you save someone's life, they owe you forEver.",My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
"You're right. Take Stacy. Oh wait, she'd pRobably just leave you all over again.",How's your recovery going? Gotten around to the small muscles yet?,"If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then Id take her for myself."
"My goodness, it's like watParkng Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward in the third grade. Excuse us wheels Mark away to another table, but not before House and Mark give each other fake smiles",turns back to Wilson How awkward was that? Wilson gives him an annoyed but knowing look What's he doing here anyway? He's got physio Tuesdays and Fridays.,"I dont know, they both want to live in a house of cheese!"
"Er, Mark is in group therapy for people coping with disability. He was thinking about dEveloping a drug addiction but that would be stupid.",Hey! Your stutters a little in exaggerated excitement you again!,Im glad Michael is getting help.
Not going to make some joke about Mark being in therapy?,What's there to say? It's only the responsible thing. I'm sure he's got a lot to deal with,"No, Im genuinely sorry the Mark thing didnt work out."
You all right? Jeff! Can you swallow?,"What makes a guy start drooling? Chase, were you wearing your short shorts?","Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. Youre lucky you dont taste very good. Anything broken?"
Muscle fatigue in his neck and jaw. He's obviously got something worse than an air embolus.,Why?,"Yes, you have very nice teeth."
Because... you don't drool from your lungs?,"Maybe the pRoblem is not the embolus itself. Maybe it's the treatment. Maybe you hit a nerve, literally.","Oh, no, its just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this."
He's too old for that,"So what would be just right, Goldilocks?",Hes too old.
"interrupting Yeah, right on schedule. So, when am I going to be done? I need to know 'cause I got plans to make. When can I safely book a game of squash? When am I going to stop being angry?",Not today.,I have to make a call after I finish.
You know House! You know we have a history!,You've been telling me for years that I should come by. Here I am. to the group Hi guys,"Well, I didnt know how to tell you before, but."
Got a Thursday group.,Poker night.,I cant do Thursday.
Poker night. Monday morning?,"Book club. Well look, if it's a pRoblem, I'll just go deal with my rage privately.","Hey, um, I was wondering if itd be ok if I go to Lonnys poker game tonight."
"Wait. If you two could resolve this tension, you could really help each other.",nods thoughtfully I'm tired of fighting.,Lets just get through this as quickly as possible.
laughs What? So either I say yes or I'm the jerk?,"Oh god, I know that feeling.",Are you set on people laughing with you?
At least you can still get around on your own.,"Yeah I know, but you're starting to walk. You're going to get better.","Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!"
"You have a job, a way to be productive.","You have a wife, which gives greater meaning. Wife could make things harder too I suppose.",You dont need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
This isn't about Stacy.,"When it happened to me, Stacy was great. She kept telling me not to rush it. I nEver beliEved her.","After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile."
She means it.,"I know, but...",I think she knows what I meant.
laughs softly as he finally realises what House is up to How the hell could she have loved a Manipulative son of a bitch like you?,That's an interesting question. Maybe she was attracted to different things in the two of us.,You didnt want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment.
She left you.,But why was she with me to begin with?,"Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?"
She made a mistake!,"Maybe it's that simple. Or maybe she saw something in me, something that she doesn't get from you.",A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
I'm not an ass!,Maybe she wanted an ass. She obviously did once.,"You know, I may have underestimated you."
"Either he goes, or I go!",You think that's the kind of thing you can just turn off?,"Look, either you leave, or we remove you."
"Dr House, cancel your book group. You're coming on Mondays.","Here's my new theory. The drooling is another competitive edge. Nobody can drive behind him, the road gets slick, he's the only one not racing in the rain!","So... when are you coming in for that free lunch? Youre gonna want to come in on a day that Im working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too."
He can barely move his arms or legs.,sighs Paralysis?,The boy has lost the use of his legs.
"Jeff doesn't want normal, he wants superpowers.",So why is he normal?,"Yeah, but Jim, Dwights a weirdo."
"Oh god, you too?","He's shooting for extraordinary, so why is Everything so ordinary?","Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Maybe his count is raised maybe what's normal for us is out of whack for him.,Can't slip anything by you.,Higher? Okay. Recently certain events have come to my attention...
That's kind of a long shot.,"Yeah, but it's been over an hour since we poked the Patient with something sharp so, get a lumbar puncture. And order broad spectrum antibiotics.","You dont turn and slide, you throw it out!"
Apparently not they proceed to intubate Jeff,"So glad we cured his respiratory arrest, freed him up to dEvelop respiratory arrest.",I cant believe theyre doing that to him!
"The white count is still the same, but the red count's fallen to 29 percent.",What was my theory yesterday?,"Were still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
I didn't screw up--,"Why would you be so petty, Chase?","Ive made many mistakes in my life, but that wasnt one of them."
"Either he's losing blood because you nicked something, or he's just not producing blood in which case we're talking acute anaemia combined with a muscular disorder. Paraneoplastic syndrome?","Either you screwed up, or he's got cancer.","Hey, wait a minute."
I think I should start smoking again.,You want a medical opinion supporting that decision?,I wont! Until I have my next cigarette.
The symptoms started as soon as I quit.,Symptoms meaning flips open the chart diarrhoea. A lot of diarrhoea.,Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
"Ten or twelve times a day, it's really embarrassing. I'm a flight attendant, and...","Well, if you're upset, my hiccups are gone.","This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after Ive been intimate with a man."
You went to his group.,"Well you were the one who was all 'Greg, you need to confront your feelings'.",What happened to the rest of your group?
hits House across the arm again that was 5 years ago.,I've been pissy.,That was like 5 years ago.
"Fine, you don't want help does that mean nobody should get it?",Mark's looking for help because... what? He's resentful? Overwhelmed? I'm asking because I care.,"So we shouldnt help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?"
"Not about him, you still want to jump me so you don't care who's married--","Look, I could get my rocks off anytime I want. What I don't seem to be able to do is my job without you hanging over my shoulder.","Wait. Rachel, no, hes married. Married! If you dont realize that, I cant help you."
"Look, I could get my rocks off anytime I want. What I don't seem to be able to do is my job without you hanging over my shoulder.",How Many packs? Turns back to the Patient,Lemme turn over a few rocks.
A bit over one a day but they were lights and I quit. Pause You used to go out with her?,Yeah. What was I thinking? I'm talking about the gum you're chewing you Ever play smoking as an oral fixation. How Many packs?,"Dont take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?"
I'm trying to protect you. Cuddy and I may be the only people stopping you from jumping off a cliff just to prove that you--,You're pissy.,Why dont I run away and you cover me?
Oh I am angry!,Pissy. You only get pissy when you're frustrated.,Are you angry with me?
You only get pissy when you're frustrated. Shut up!,"Ok, I'm wrong.",Yeah. Youre just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
"This is unbelievably difficult for Mark, which you should know, which you should be able to summon up some lEvel of empathy for.",Right. The cripple boys. We should start a band.,"Look, I know whats going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me."
"I have a good thing with Mark, we are handling this the best way we know how.",And none of this has anything to do with me?,"Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?"
"No, nothing! Except that you can't, or won't just let it go! Let it go. Walks back out slamming the door",You're being poisoned.,Nothing. Not a damn thing.
You're being poisoned. By gum?,Sugarless gum uses sorbitol as a sweetener. We use sorbitol as a laxative.,I got gum in my hair.
"Well, he's negative for bleeds.","Congratulations, Chase. It's cancer. Clean him up and let Oncology have him, it's their party now.","Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank."
Unless it's drug-induced. He's lying about not being on EPO?,Why would he lie?,It sure seems like he is lying.
What does it matter?,"People lie for thousands of reasons, but there's always a reason.",How could it not matter?
"Philosophically interesting, medically irrelevant.",Unless he's not lying.,"No, no its not interesting."
"I assume if I point out the fact that you have no right to do that, you'll interpret that as a sign of guilt?",Wilson's chatty. Plus he's got two ex-wives to support. You want me to tell him he's fired?,"I understand. But its not your fault, you know that, dont you? You mustnt feel guilty."
"Until we figure out who's behind this, I'm sitting in with you guys. You have the ethics of a four-year-old I'm going to treat you like one.",How am I supposed to practice medicine with a Lawyer sitting on my shoulder?,"Ok fine, you know what, this actually isnt amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides."
How am I supposed to practice medicine with a Lawyer sitting on my shoulder? Responsibly.,You know I can't do that!,"Now, I have to take care of a legal issue."
Somebody once told me that Everybody lies. Since you're the only people who know he has cancer--,He doesn't have cancer.,Another lie. You have a sickness!
"The point is, you're his medical team. He's threatening to sue.",Why would Cameron leak cancer? How does cancer make the guy look bad? Lengthy pause He's on EPO. Rushes out,You realize this is a legal document that says you cant sue the company.
Why would Cameron leak cancer? How does cancer make the guy look bad? Lengthy pause He's on EPO. Rushes out,"Your anaemia is caused by pure red cell aplasia. This is going to hurt, but we got to talk.",He heard you made a big splash at the meeting.
What the hell are you doing?!,He'll be fine.,What are you doing?
He doesn't have cancer?,"That's the good news. Bad news is, pants are on fire. Acute PRCA is caused by drugs, most commonly, EPO. Ready, and... action! he pulls the gas mask off",Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.
I haven't used EPO.,"puts the gas mask back on Ok, this time, more anger! Remember, this guy's accusing you of cheating. Takes the gas mask off again","I dont know, Howard isnt really the family fun kind of guy."
I haven't used that stuff.,"Oh kisses his fingertips mwah, I beliEved it.","ooo... Watch out for that stuff. Itll stain if it gets on your clothes, and itll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth."
Snatches the mask out of House's hands and gives it back to Jeff Give me that! He doesn't do EPO!,"Hmm...what do you think? That was a different way to go but, I don't know, I just didn't buy it. Does she handle any of your injections?","Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person."
You think I'm giving it to him? Test him!,"Gee, that's a great idea.","Um, Im just gonna hand it to him right now."
That stuff could kill me.,"scoffs at them by mimicking Jeff Come on, give her a break.",I hope it kills us both.
I would nEver do anything to hurt you.,Who're you going to beliEve? Manager you've trusted for years? Snorts I've been to college,"No, little bird, I wont hurt you."
It's not possible. The drugs should be flushing out of his system.,Can't leave if they don't exist.,But youre going to stop them?
"But EPO use explains Every one of his symptoms. He's been lying and cheating, and now it's coming back to bite him.",The only pRoblem with that theory is it's based on the assumption that the universe is a just place.,Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
You're still not explaining the PRCA.,What's his red count now?,Youre just misappropriating my understanding.
"Had to give him a blood transfusion, he's back around 30.",He needed a transfusion?,"Yeah, we got him back."
"Well he was losing blood, so I thought maybe he needed blood.",makes a dramatic gesture with the stirring stick Go forth and scan his neck.,"Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?"
makes a dramatic gesture with the stirring stick Go forth and scan his neck. His neck?,Or repeat Everything I say in question form.,Hes rubbing his neck.
Or repeat Everything I say in question form.,She came into the clinic and yelled at me. Then she left. Then she came back and yelled some more.,"Oh, come on, its easy, hell even tell you what to say."
Hmm. Yelling. That might be a clue.,"I know what the yelling means, it's the coming and going I find interesting. It's not rational.","Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again."
Anger's not rational?,"Some anger is. She could have pulled me aside, screamed at me privately. Her beef is simple and well-founded. She was out of control.","I know. Its not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Lets keep those tight."
You're having fun aren't you?,"She's in my face, I need to know why.","Oh, youre not having fun, are you?"
"She's in my face, I need to know why. Professional reasons.","Oh, why else?",Because shes conflicted.
How'd you know to look in his neck? Thymoma's usually present in the chest,I knew it wasn't in his chest. All we've done since he checked in is look at his chest.,"you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, its so healthy Im always like is this moving to fast?"
All the more reason not to think--,There are two types of PRCA.,Yeah thats right you werent thinking!
"With that kind of anaemia, he would have needed constant... Blood transfusions.",Which he was getting in convenient blood-doping form.,"No, Raj had to go to the nurse."
He was treating himself without Even knowing it.,Up to half of Patients with chronic PRCA have a thymoma. And up to half of Patients with a thymoma! takes out a syringe I've always wanted to do this.,"I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!"
Does that mean I'm-- Ow.,You are healed! Rise and walk.,Youre a putz.
Are you insane?,"In the Bible, you just say Yes Lord and then, start right in on the praising.","Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
"First you tell me I've got cancer, and then you tell me that my Manager-- starts making a hand gesture then realises he can actually move his hand What did you do?","No, what did you Lord.","You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and theres no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt youre about to eat has expired."
It can hit you that fast?,"Treatment for PRCA is blood transfusions, treatment for MG is hyperbaria.",I just dont want to get hit by it.
So... the whole thing with my Manager..?,"raises his hand to his lips Ooops. No, no EPO. This has nothing to do with anything you did. You can let her know she's in the clear.",He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when youve been working here two days?
"I could. Or, 10 percent of a Nike contract is a hell of a lot of cash.","makes a snarky face when Jeff isn't looking You don't need your thymus. Take it out, Everything else is Manageable.",So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
Manageable. I thought you just cured me.,"Nuh uh, this is just diagnostic.",You look strong.
"You've come to search my office you should wait ten minutes I'll be out of your hair. Here, start with my purse throws it across to House just save me some mints. What do you want to know? My sex life with Mark? My guilt over crippling your damn leg? Or are you just here to gloat because you weren't the leak?",I want to apologise he solemnly sits down Maybe I've been punishing you for a little too long.,"Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer."
I hate you. And I love you. And I love Mark.,You don't hate him?,"Hi, Im Mark."
You don't hate him? No.,So what do we do?,Yeah. Hate him.
We deal with each other.,Right. That plan's been working great so far.,Do we understand each other.
"It'll get better, it'll get easier.",Why?,"Oh, come on, it can always get better."
smiling You'd be surprised what you can live with. walks out of the office,"Hey, I need you to open that door.","Out of my office, turns out youre fired."
"Hey, I need you to open that door. Not allowed.","Yeah er... I was having therapy in here today, and er, I left my cane.",Let me get that door for you
"I was having therapy in here today, and er, I left my cane. Sorry.",Dude! I'm crippled.,Sorry. Im moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
My offer's withdrawn you can walk to work.,"Got it, you're morally outraged. Now can we get through this part? 'Cause the next part's awesome. He takes a bite of toast.","Hi. Um, Ive reconsidered. Uh, you cant work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening."
How do you rationalize something like this? You broke into Stacy's therapist's office--,Borrowed a key,Theres no time to explain.
--and stole her treatment notes!,"Nope! I made copies. Mark is, and I quote Wilson groans. Withdrawn, passive-aggressive, won't communiCate, like he resents me because I can walk.",And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
I don't want to hear this.,"Dishes in the sink, toilet seat up.",We do not wanna hear about this.
It says she thinks you're an annoying jerk. Throws the notes on to a table.,It's a pet name. Picks the notes back up. Here's the kicker. Shows the notes to Wilson again Wilson reads it again with interest this time.,"I hadnt spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note."
They're not having sex? House and Wilson share a look.,"Doctor cleared him, but no liftoff. She's frustrated so she's doc-blocking me. Paperwork, seminars, meddling with my Patients","Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard theyre either having sex or Howards caught in a milking machine."
"Great, now you've got the proof you need. Just take those personal psych records to Cuddy, that'll show her Stacy's out of control. House turns away, looking for something. You ignoring me?","While looking for my newspaper, efficient huh?","Im, Im freaking out!"
Over here! Camera pans to a young Man leaning against the back of Wilson's car reading House's newspaper.,"Sighs. Dr Wilson, I want you to meet my stalker","A newsstand, Phoebe is looking at a magazine as the guy from before walks by and picks up a newspaper."
Your waiting room sucks.,I am not treating you.,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Err... we're not... err... together.,"Turns around to give Wilson a look. He is so self-loathing. Grabs the newspaper from Kalvin. Well, we've got to go now, so maybe see you after work--","Oh. No, no. Were not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together."
"No, no, no! Ah... Pushes his file into House's hands. nobody can figure out what's wrong with me.",Doesn't bother to look at the file.,"Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. Wow. Done. Okay, lets do it."
"Brilliant, but, Grabs the end of House's cane. my immune system is fine.",Your concentration camp physique begs to differ. Get your T-cell count re-checked.,And is this in case the house sneezes?
It was negative.,All of this will be fascinating to an HIV specialist. Now let go of my cane before it becomes your new boyfriend.,"Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned Me and my Girlfriend?"
"Honey, I will marry it if you would look at my file.","Congress says you can't, so...","Yes, I will marry you."
"Congress says you can't, so...",I didn't touch him. He's intrigued.,We cant. Not yet.
Go see Stacy.,"We gave him epi, he's fine.","Yeah, I hear ya."
"You need a Lawyer, go see Stacy. You hit a Patient.","Four words, two mistakes. He's not a Patient, and I didn't hit him.",Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stressinduced outburst.
"Of course you didn't, go see Stacy.",I didn't cause the anaphylaxis. It's pRobably one of his HIV meds abacavir.,"Yes, you didOh my God you didnt!"
You have to treat him.,"Medically, this case is a snooze-fest. AIDS plus infection.",Well get to work on him right away.
You don't treat him he charges you with assault.,Just 'cause he says I hit him doesn't make it true.,"Like, What? What?. And then well just give him a little punch in the back and"
I forgot Wednesday was hooker day. This could've waited!,You make me meet you at your House. Your husband is conveniently absent.,Did somebody order a hooker over here?
"Mark's at physio, I'm stuck waiting for the exterminator. House gives a questioning look. I saw a rat last night.","Well, I'm surprised your feet are touParkng the floor.","OK, I dont want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard."
I barely slept.,Takes off his jacket.,I couldnt sleep.
What're you doing?,"Sorry, it's driving me nuts.","Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat."
You hate washing dishes.,People change. I could make sure you'd sleep like a baby tonight.,"Well, then why dont you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?"
Rather take care of that myself. Walks up to the sink to help House.,I was referring to the rat.,Obviously Im going to clean up.
What's going on?,"It's not what you think. I know it looks like we're cleaning dishes, but actually we're having sex.",So youre moving in with him.
"Take ten minutes, cure the guy, and stop whining. Walks after Mark.","I give you Kalvin Ryan so flamboyant in person, so boring on paper. Obviously got an opportunistic infection, pRobably TB or PCP.","Yknow if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning?"
Have you read his file?,"I started, but I found the characters two-dimensional.",You have his email?
"He went to an HIV clinic last week. Tested negative for TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV. It's not an infection.","HIV clinic. So few Patients, so much money Sorts his mail. re-do the tests.",Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
The results make sense. Kalvin's T-cells are at 200.That's strong enough to fight infection.,"Fine, parasite.",Youre not sick.
Face it this might be an interesting case.,What if his immune system is too strong?,Well heres an interesting turn of events.
"An auto-immune disease? With HIV, that's impossible.",His new HIV meds kicked his system out of a sound sleep.,Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
"His meds made him so much better, he made himself sick. Sounds pretty--","BORING! This is so not interesting. Chest X-ray and find the old infections, start him on steroids.","When youre sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!"
"If you're wrong, steroids will tank his immune system. He'll get worse.",Now THAT would be interesting. Where's the coumadin?,"It. That kid doesnt put in some farm time, hes gonna stay like that."
If your Patient's got a blood pRoblem then blood thinners aren't exactly--,It's for Stacy's rat death by anti-coagulation. He reaches for a bottle.,"Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that dont have blood in them?"
Trying to win Stacy back by killing an animal... very caveMan.,"I don't want her back. I just want her to admit her feelings for me. I go to Cuddy, Cuddy fires her or re-assigns her. Either way, I'm happy.","Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish."
"Pinches the bridge of his nose. If you want her back, either tell her, or, better yet, shut up, and cry yourself to sleep like Everybody else.",Picks up the phone.,How can she make you get back together with her?
It ran into that heating vent right there.,Hopefully Mark's anger will go away Eventually.,Did you just break the radiator?
"He's not angry, just doesn't like you. Nothing unique there.","Didn't seem really wild about you, either.",He seems to hate you.
He's fine with me.,He's angry. Said so in group.,Fine with me.
Of course he's angry he's looking at months of painful physio.,Smells a ball of cheese he brought wrapped in foil. He's mad at you.,"Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but Im guessing still angry?"
There's no way he said that.,"Sighs. No, but it's true. He resents you for being able to walk. Been there. I resented you for hell of a long time.","Ow!Ow!Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Yknow, ow!"
Might be the hospital. She walks out.,Picks up the cell phone. What!?,"Rachels Office, shes slinking out to where Tag works and checks to make sure no one is coming."
Bad time? Where are you?,At your girlfriend's place. Ignore the moaning and squeaking.,This is a very very bad time.
His lungs are too scarred to tell which infection triggered the immune reconstitution.,He a smoker?,Rosss apartment.
"Yes, and possibly more than cigarettes. His tox screen came back positive for recreational drugs.",Not surprising. Not medically relevant.,Did he go out for a cigarette?
His heart looks a little enlarged.,That's a typical side-effect of AZT. What are Kalvin's most recent infections?,"Oh, hes like a different man."
"Toxo, CMV and PCP.",Whispers into the phone. Well let's assume it's one of those. Give him Ganciclovir for the CMV...,"Im sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention"
"Whoa, we can hardly hear you. Where are you?","In a closet. Your girlfriend's other boyfriend showed up. Ganciclovir for the CMV, Sulfadiazine for the Toxo, Bactrim for PCP. Gotta go. It's killing time. Puts down the phone.",And now everything is going to change?
"I recommend post-exposure prophylaxis. Your chances of conversion are slim, but I'd like to put you on three antiviral medications finavir, zidovudine and lamivudine. There are side-effects - headache, nausea, vivid dreaming. You'll be tested for HIV in 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months... His voice starts to fade away as the background music becomes louder.",Very interesting.,WI dont understand.
"He coughs infected blood in Cameron's eyes and mouth, that's interesting?","The coughing part, not the in Cameron part. New symptom, blood vessel ruptured in his lung.","Uh, you, you want to see James Camerons kidney stone?"
I closed the tear.,Well it takes immune reconstitution off the table.,"I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery."
You know some huMan beings are actually capable of huMan feelings.,My giving a damn or not is not going to change what happened.,You are lucky that this feelings machine doesnt have feelings.
Could be Kaposi's Syndrome.,"No edema, no blood in urine.",Youre not marrying Roose Bolton.
"He puts a hand on her shoulder, she shrugs it off. I'm fine.","Oh this is good, he's pretending to care, you're pretending not to.",Im okay... Im okay... Im... Ohh...
I think we should reconsider drugs. Kalvin uses crystal meth.,Concerned enough about his health to stalk me while indulging in deadly street drugs. Takes a vicodin. Study in contradictions. Interesting. Still not medically relevant.,I love when people say like crack when theyve obviously never done crack.
"It could be, if his drugs were tainted. They cook meth with battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...","Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins Ducklings start to walk out. Foreman, you're with me.","Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael."
"Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins Ducklings start to walk out. Foreman, you're with me.",I need a consult on another case.,Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
You have another case?,It's a hip-pocket deal. Patient presents with a distinct neck tilt.,I dont have an in case.
Wry Neck. Is he an athlete?,He's a regular runner.,Ross? Whats with the neck?
Any pain associated with movement.,"None that he's complained of They reach a vending maParkne, House gestures for Foreman to hand him some coins which Foreman does automatically.",Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did.
"Best case scenario, an infection in the ear or lungs worst case, brain stem tumor. Should do an MRI, CAT scan, full work-up.",Uhh! I don't think so Gets his drink from the vending maParkne. No insurance.,"I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, Id recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain."
"Pre-World War II fluorescent bulbs contained large amounts of beryllium. Beryllium dust inflames the lungs, they get rigid, Patient can't breathe. House gives him a questioning look. My father co-authored a paper on acute berylliosis.","Phew! For a moment there I thought you were smart. Cameron, get a biopsy of Calvin's lung tissue. Run a spectrographic analysis.","Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding."
I can handle it.,No reason to risk exposing the entire team. Then who would I torment?,"Well, if I didnt think you could handle it, I wouldnt be asking."
Rushes in to find House sitting in the middle of her attic. You broke into my House?,"Well I had to, Mark isn't here.","Oh, oh no."
He has physio.,Oh really? How's he doing?,What is his pwoblem?
What happened with all the cheese?,I had to get rid of it before Steve McQueen ate any coumadin.,"Im sorry, did you say cheese?"
Death cures both those things.,Well we can't kill him.,Only death can pay for life.
Oh! She turns away in disgust.,"Sniffs it. You missing any asparagus? Ok, stuff these. He hands her a bottle of antibiotics. He doesn't get better, then it's a tumor.","All right, all right maybemaybe you should just ask her to leave."
Then what? Chemo?,Steve McQueen without hair? Shakes his head. It's a blessing he died young. They both smile.,"Oh, thats nice."
Looking at Cameron. You ok?,"She's fine, pRobably getting bored with the question. Masses in the heart and lungs, what kind of cancer are we looking at?","Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, Im gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?"
"Lymphoma's a death sentence, sarcoidosis is treatable.","So's an ear infection, but since he didn't test positive for that either!","Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis."
I wanna do the Kveim-Siltzbach test.,Splutters. Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed? Cameron doesn't budge House seems to like that idea a lot. Do it.,"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure youre going to be ok?"
Splutters. Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed? Cameron doesn't budge House seems to like that idea a lot. Do it.,So! how is the Patient's father?,Im not sure the temporary replacement of an H.
how is the Patient's father? Uh!,'Tell my dad I'm sorry?' Might as well wave the red flag at a bull.,"Boy, I want to tell you its her loss, but you are not making it easy."
He's not coming.,"Well it's not a tragedy, dad doesn't want to see him, he doesn't want to see the dad. You're the only one who wants them together.",OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
You're the only one who wants them together. He asked!,He thought he was dying.,I just dont see why those two cant work things out!
What did you say when you thought you were dying?,"Pregnant pause. On the other hand, Cameron sighs, not getting an answer as usual. his dad tossed him out. So what's our guy want to apologize for?","If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?"
So you just show up Every time he's at physio?,"'Course not! Also when he's at group therapy, or out for dinner with friends.",Do you always have to bring him here?
And when she happens to mention to Mark that you dropped by?,You tell your wife Everything?,What if MaryAngela comes to the door and I ask for MaryAngela?
"It's a! process. Sighs. But Stacy doesn't have any reason to hide this from Mark. Follows House out of the office. As far as she knows, Mark's okay with you being there.","My bet is she mentions me to Mark as little as possible, 'cause she thinks that he thinks that she still has feelings for me.","Its fine. Erin, youre going to go. And youre going to make sure Michael tells the truth."
Because she still has feelings for you? Deadpan voice.,"If you're right, she did tell him, and I don't get through the door tonight. But if I'm right! House gets into the elevator, the door closes.",Is it because shes dating you but was out with that other fellow?
So how long do we stay here?,'Til something happens.,"Wow, so, how long will you be gone?"
He's not going to come out with us right here.,"We are downwind, and he seems to have hearing loss.","If he comes out, distract him."
He's not blind.,Steve McQueen does not run from danger. Antibiotics on the other hand! He picks a pill up from the floor.,How am I supposed to know what was on his mind?
He ate around the pill? Smart!,"Admit it, you like him.",Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
He's alright! for a rat.,You wanna now how cool he is?,"What, is he your pet rat?"
"Okay, I blow my smoke into the vents so Mark doesn't know.",I always knew.,Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke.
I always knew. Bluffing!,"You started two weeks after my surgery. Menthols, then lights after a month.",Aha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Why didn't you say anything?,"'Cause it helped me monitor your misery lEvel. One trip outside was a good day, upwards of six you were in hell.","Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but yknow, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal."
You could have asked me how I was!,I already knew. Sorry you were miserable.,Im good! How are you? So...
Come on Chase don't turn into a good guy on me now.,You're late! and hung over. Looks carefully at Cameron. Or maybe not.,"Ok, not that you need it but good."
Why do you have a rat?,Jealous?,"No. No, and its not a rat, its a rabbit. We need to save it."
Like hell it isn't! At Cameron. You said you didn't call!,Don't mind me. Just here for the show.,Why didnt you call?
"Yeah well, there's not going to be any.","What happened to the big apology? Yesterday he was all 'Daddy, I'm so sowwy.'","Oh, I dont think there will be."
This is none of your business.,You should have thought of that before you stalked me. Now I'm interested. To the dad. So what's he got to apologize for? You're the one who tossed him out.,"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldnt want anything to, you know, drive her away."
Now why would I do that?,I don't know. 'Cause it's tough to brag to your hunting buddies that your son knows all the words of The Wiz.,I really like to say that Imum Yknow what Id really like to say?
That's a lie!,42nd Street?,Thats a lie.
Just leave it alone.,Just want to leave the bigot with some peace of mind after you're gone?,Im sorry. I should have left it alone.
"Look, this has got nothing, and I mean nothing to do with him being gay! Now Kal brought this on himself, with what he did to his mother!",He steal her signature look?,Cause hes totally gay?
"No, he killed her. Kalvin lied!","Yeah, that certainly is shocking.","Yes, he chose her and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
"Pacing and talking very fast. Mom's kidneys were failing, she needed a transplant, they tested Kalvin, he was a match. He was also positive for HIV, mom nEver found a qualified donor, she dies.",Tragic tale. Undercut slightly by the rapid fire delivery and constant movement. Too much coffee this morning?,We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his.
So you always use a condom? Uhh... yeah!,Brother's on the down-low got to,"Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet Ive had since I was twelve."
To House. You?,Working girls are sticklers. You're not going to poll Chase? She looks at him sharply.,"Im going home, and Im taking my baby with me."
I'm not an idiot.,Obviously not.,Are you calling me an idiot?
"He gives Cameron and Chase a pointed look that plainly speaks of lEvels of satisfaction for finding out Foreman looks surprised, but grins. Where's Wilson?",We got the result for the Kveim test. Shakes his head slightly. Cameron sighs.,"Doesnt look happy, so Im guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon."
So now you've got to drum up another excuse to be around the love of your life. Could hit another Patient.,"Nyah, don't like to repeat myself. People will say I'm formulaic.","Well, what do you mean why?"
Well that rules out letting the rat go so you can catch him again.,"I can't do that, Steve needs two weeks antibiotics and a smoke-free environment. Cigarettes aggravated his infection.","Well the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Nights Watch now."
The rat is actually sick? That thing could infect the entire hospital!,Steve's infection is not contagious to huMans. I'm an idiot. How did I miss mycoplasmosis? Was that the kid's father?,"Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives."
Yeah. Remember the Black Death? Started with rats,What's he doing in the hallway? His kid getting his biopsy already?,"For the record, giant rats are possible."
He just won't go in the room. Who knows what else he has - parasites? Bacterial infection?,Kid doesn't have parasites.,"To make sure its not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution."
"Not the kid, the rat!",Was he still sweating?,Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rats only sweat through their tails.,"Not the rat, the dad! Wilson doesn't have an answer. House starts walking back towards the dad. Where are they from?",And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
Err! Montana. What's going on?,"You were right, it's a parasite.",Do you know the other state?
"Yeah, uhh! I'm not going in there.",Your son asked to talk to you.,I am not going in there!
As dad walks in. Why is he here?,Slides the door closed. He wanted to talk to you.,"Dad, what are you doing?"
Makes a noise as he suddenly realizes that House lied to him.,Did you two use to hunt together? Foxes. Did you kill foxes?,"Phoebes apartment, there is a beeping noise coming from the living room and Phoebe sleepily goes to investigate."
Did you kill foxes? It's Montana.,Walks towards Kalvin.,"Jan, have you ever had deer?"
I've been tested for parasites.,"Okay, it's cancer. You happy? The cysts isolate the parasites, keeping them from showing up in stool samples, Even in blood tests, cardiac--","Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking?"
"All right, you don't need me for this.",But you've got the same things in your liver.,"I dont need your help, Penny."
I have cirrhosis.,"Liver cysts have identical symptoms with one addition, fEver. Now liver cysts we can test for. Your diagnosis could confirm Kalvin's. So, option A, we draw some blood--",Cholermus. Its a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. Im preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
"No, look, you're not touParkng me.","You see, this is why I need you here. I want you to tell your son that you won't take a simple painless blood test to save his life.","Uh, no. Its othank you. You know what? You dont have tooh no, no, no. No, no, no. Its okay."
"If you'd have worn a damn rubber, you'd have been fine could have saved her life. You wouldn't be lying here!","Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it!","If youd have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
I'm living my life the way I want.,To the dad. Are you going to give me some blood?,You feeling fulfilled in your life?
"Look, if he doesn't give a damn then neither do I!",Okay. Option B. Why did your wife kill herself? Did she hate you?,He dont give an F about nothin!
You know you don't know a thing about my Suzanne.,"Either Suzanne wanted to die, or she was both fat AND stupid.",Youve never asked me about your mother.
"And girls with big appetites, well they just can't get enough - of anything! Shut up!",PRobably nibbled on Every devil dog in the county!,I bet you boys have a big appetite.
PRobably nibbled on Every devil dog in the county! SHUT UP!,"Just in case I'm not making myself clear, I don't mean the delicious snack!",He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.
"Punches House, forcing House to reel back against the window. You son of a bitch! Yeah? Come on!",Pats his jaw very calmly.,You pushed Darryl out the window?
Are you out of your mind?!,You said you didn't care.,"Oh. Ohh. Ohh, youre out of your mind."
"You said you didn't care. House uses his cane to push the dad back against the wall by pushing it against his neck. Notice how you can't breathe? The father sounds like he's choking/wheezing/going into shock. Now either that's the cane, or I just ruptured one of those liver cysts we were chatting about and you've gone into anaphylactic shock, exactly the same as your son did when he accidentally tripped against my friend's car. I'm just SO excited to find out which! House takes his cane off and the father slips to the floor clutParkng at his middle section. I'm gonna schedule surgery.","Two successful surgeries, two lives saved. I'm over my quota. Can I have next week off?","Downstairs at Dannys party, Monica and Rachel are coming down the stairs and Rachel has on a coat to make it look as if shes just getting back."
Two family members assaulted.,It was self defense.,Two brothers now fight with me.
You baited him.,"You're right. I was asking for it. The low-cut blouse, the 'Do-Me' pumps.",You want us to use you as bait?
"You flooded his gut with a parasite, he could sue. Go see Stacy.",Okay. Gets up to leave.,I dont care if he ate your friend.
That's it? Okay? No name-calling? No squawking? No rending of garments?,I like this T-shirt.,"Okay, theres going to no more shouting and no skeetshooting."
Heard you hit another Patient.,"Yeah, sure. Why not? He hit me first.","Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay."
Cuddy didn't mention that. Let me see. She comes around the desk to look at his jaw.,I'm the doctor.,Thats not true!
"My concern is purely legal. Pats the skin where he got punched. Looks okay, does it hurt?",A little.,Youre not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
You need some ice. She goes to fetch some from the little fridge in the corner.,There's no way that Mark doesn't know Stacy turns around. about the smoking.,"Okay, look III do something nice, okay?"
He would have said something. She applies some ice wrapped in a cloth to the purpling area where he got punched.,Then he hasn't been near you in months.,"Well, He came close."
Then he hasn't been near you in months. We're fine.,Can't be easy.,"OK, so what, youre just never gonna see him again?"
Can't be easy. Stop squirming.,Why would you lie about this?,Well its not that easy.
I'm not lying.,"I don't care if you're sleeping with him or not, but you're not, so!","All right, Im sorry, youre famous."
I am. Stops trying to put the ice on the bruise.,You're lying.,"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday."
You know when I have sex? You can smell that on me too? The only people who know about what's going on between me and Mark are me and Mark.,I just know you.,Dont you realise none of this wouldve ever happened if I didnt think at that same moment you werent having sex with Mark?
"And I know you. You're confident, arrogant, but you're nEver certain unless there's a reason to be certain. One other person knew, I told you I was seeing Dr Harper. You can easily get into her office, you read my file. House doesn't deny it. You read my file? She now sounds like she's about to break into tears. The dishes, the concern, the, oh, acting like a huMan being? You have! This whole time you've been Manipulating me?",You knew I had an angle the moment I poured soap onto a scrub brush.,"Oh, God. Dont make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis."
"Because 40% of our lawsuits last year were about House. You can't work with him, you can't work here.",She's over-reacting.,because he fired you which means apparently youre living in your car now.
"You snuck into her shrink's office and read her private file. When Nixon did that, he got impeached.",So you're saying I'm not allowed to have oral sex with an intern either?,I also stole something off of her computer.
Scores a coin in House's hands. Yes! And yes.,The file got me on the floor of her attic with her pouring out her soul.,"When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes."
Walking into the office carrying a handful of papers. Where's Chase?,He's too busy to service you until after work.,Hes in the office.
Throws the pieces of paper on to the table in front of House. This one says you're okay with moving the disciplinary hearing to tomorrow. This one says I've advised you of your legal rights.,"Uh huh, any legal rights I should know about?","The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a diceylooking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium."
"Nope. Angrily tosses her pen on to the table, Wilson winces.",Great. To Wilson. And you thought this was going to be awkward. He signs the papers.,Take this pen and stab me with it.
"It's typically small joints, this hit her knee. Takayasu's arthritis.",Get a sed rate and serologies. He keeps struggling as he can't get the lid open. Parkld proof. How Many kids are hopped up on vicodin?,"Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something."
How Many kids are hopped up on vicodin? Gimme.,"Right, like I'd Ever get it back. Chase. He tosses the bottle to Chase.",How is you drinking helping the kids?
"No, she'd have oral sores.",Or genital. To Chase. Go find them.,She would get this little foam mustache.
She'd have oral sores.,Or genital. Go find them.,"Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them"
Or genital. Go find them.,"Whoa, whoa Foreman! Chase can handle the pelvic.","For the record, I do have genitals."
She's only advising Chase? Not you?,Well what's the committee going to do to me? I haven't Even met this Patient.,. . . as are the rest of her advisors.
"Your disdain for huMan interaction doesn't exculpate you, it inculpates you. You sign the charts, you're responsible for Everything Chase does.","Which is why this doesn't matter she protects Chase, she protects me.","All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesnt look like you have much of a case, Sheldon."
"Unless her advice to Chase is to make a deal and give you up. He fakes a VERY bad Australian accent. I'm so sorry, if only Dr. House had paid attention, he'd nEver Even met her, he nEver does.",Chase loves me. And isn't Turkish.,"No, no, no, see thats why you have to do this job, agents always lie."
Cameron loves you. Chase loves his job.,Is about to enter an exam room in the clinic. You really think Stacy hates me that much?,"Im telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think."
Systolic BP's 70.,Where's the ulcer?,Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
There. Second ulcer?,Not anymore. It perforated.,"Please, its nearly healed."
Two months like this.,"Let me guess, no insurance, just heard about the free clinic. It's a good move. You don't want to skimp on the essentials like wristwatches, MP3 players!","Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago."
I need to talk to you.,From the doorway?,If you want to talk to me
From the doorway? It's confidential.,Cool.,Through the door.
Two questions. Why did Chase screw up and how bad was it?,Wow. Talk about efficient. I only need one answer - Chase didn't screw up.,It was a lot of snap decisions.
He said he did.,"Well I'm not a Lawyer, but that seems like a sucky legal strategy.",Oh. He did? What did he say?
They're gonna wanna know what you think a reasonable doctor would have done in Chase's position.,"If I thought he was a 'reasonable' doctor, I wouldn't have hired him.","I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant."
God you two are a couple of geniuses. Deny Everything completely fool the Lawyer who's trying to help you. Too bad the review committee members are actually doctors.,Stacy.,Theres no need for us to play games.
"Bleeding ulcer, we've got it. She was fine 2 hours ago.","If by 'fine', you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of Every orifice then yeah, I beliEve you.",So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours.
"If by 'fine', you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of Every orifice then yeah, I beliEve you.",I'm guessing those are celebratory bells.,Why dont you think shes fine?
Systolic BP's 70.,Show me the ulcer.,"Oh I dont know, 50, 55."
It's brown. I cauterized it.,"Sweep back, show me the whole stomach. Chase sweeps the camera back. Stop.",Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Stop. Second ulcer?,Not anymore. It perforated.,"Pam, no! Are you nuts? Were going to the hospital now."
Let's go. The nurses wheel Kayla after him.,She was not fine 2 hours ago. She mentioned stomach pain?,"Were going to the hospital, Michael."
"Yeah, so I gave her a stronger--",You didn't do an exam.,"Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well."
She just came in for a follow-up. The results of the pathergy test.,Did you listen to her stomach? Check her vitals?,"Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure shes doing okay."
"Maybe if she'd said something about taking ibuprofen, mentioned the rectal bleeding!","Yeah, why didn't she go to med school like you did?! Diarrhea! Blood in the stool! These are routine questions--","Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. Hes the guy wholl be interviewing you."
Doctors skip all the time! It was a minor mistake I couldn't have known this was going to happen--,Mistakes are as serious as the results they cause! This Woman could die because you were too lazy to ask one simple question!,"Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, shes not coming."
She might die because I had the bad luck to spill your damn vicodin pills!,"And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about.","Well, she told me that Im gonna die this week, so Im kinda bummed about that."
"And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about.",Unless you convince Chase to roll on me.,I said I dont want to talk about it.
"Excuse me, testify about what?",Uhh!,"I have some, uh, experience."
Like I have?,"Buck has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. His lung tissue's turning to rock. There's no known cause, no treatment. He is slowly suffocating.","Good luck Michael, I hope you find what youre looking for."
You're talking about me?,"Lung transplant's about a half a million dollars, but this poor sucker's got no insurance.","No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me."
That's how you tell this guy he's dying?,"Oh relax. He's got a cold, and soon, health insurance.","Cant you see whats going on here, this man is dead."
Such a hero always righting wrongs. Who cares who you have to Manipulate.,I'm sorry. I didn't realize you and Buck were so close. Walks out of the exam room.,We all have a hero in our heart.
It's a point of principle.,Right. It's got nothing to do with what I did to you.,That does seem to be a valid principle.
There's nothing for us to talk about.,Takes some lollipops from the clinic counter and puts them in his pocket. That's why you're following me. I read some notes--,"Wait, if you guys didnt talk, what did you never mind, stupid question."
If Chase screwed up--,"I was wrong. Terribly, terribly, sorry.",Worstcase scenario were back to running.
"If Chase screwed up so badly, why didn't you fire him?",He has great hair.,"You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him."
Grabbing on to House's arm to stop him from walking away. What are you hiding?,"I'm gay. Oh, that's not what you meant. It does explain a lot though. No girlfriend, always with Wilson, obsession with sneakers...",Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
Forget it. We can't give a liver to a Woman this sick.,Do you listen to what you're saying?,Yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil!
And kidney damage. It's healing.,You know what's really killing her?,"When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee."
"Your point, beyond just trying to make Chase wet himself seems to be that the hospital faces liability here. Well thanks for clearing that up. I still need a medical reason to list her.",That is a medical reason!,"Alright, lets give her a break."
Your Patient's hardly clotting.,Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma pre-op.,You have dragons blood in your veins?
Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma pre-op. Pretty risky.,Well that's why I came to the best transplant surgeon in the hospital. She's dead without you.,If I take a Lactaid a halfhour before and some Pepto right after.
Smiles. Get her in this afternoon.,Sighs. Thank you very much.,Ill take her back tomorrow.
"And this was right before you ran the marathon, I suppose?","Was it the part where he warmly clasped my hands in thanks, was that too much?","Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do."
What'd you do to him?,The hospital Lawyer asks me if I did something unethical.,What did he do to you?
You'll tell me.,Oh.,You can tell us.
"Anything you say is attorney-client. So you can get advice about the bad, bad thing you did, knowing I'll be tortured because I can't tell a soul.","He winks. Actually, it is kinda cool.",You are being counseled at this very moment.
"Are you completely out of your mind? She's dying on her own, why would I volunteer to be her executioner? House hands him an envelope. I'd just be inviting a lawsuit from the brother, no matter what! He opens the envelope, there's money inside.","5 grand. And that's just ante money. After the surgery, you get another 15. Though I warn you, that includes the tip.",Joffrey has made this poor girls life miserable since the day he took her fathers head.
Laughs scornfully. I make 600 grand a year you think I'm going to risk tanking my percentages for 20 thousand? He throws the envelope down on the table.,Shrugs. It's tax free.,"Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?"
"For the record, I hope the department takes you and Chase and drop-kicks both your asses out the back door.",Nods.,Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
"Nods. Great He pockets the envelope. means I don't have to bother welshing on the 15 grand I would have owed you. If you don't do the surgery, He starts to walk away. I'm going to tell your wife that you've been sleeping with a series of nurses. Currently Nurse Cutler in Radiology. Now what's 600 grand divided by two?","Last Christmas party, Nurse Cutler handed you one of those little hotdogs.","Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I dont want that hanging over my head."
There is no way you'll tell her.,Of course I won't.,How could you tell her?
"Of course I won't. I'm much too cowardly. AyersMan looks defeated. No, I'd just send an anonymous letter. Now I've uh... I've got an OR booked for 4 this afternoon. Are you free? Eats the sweet.",Hmm.,Youre too stupid to be a coward.
You bribed him and then you blackmailed him?!,She'd have been dead in 2 days if I hadn't made AyersMan do the surgery.,He didnt try to make you pay?
Leave the blackmail out of the story you tell the committee.,Tried to leave it out of the story I told you.,"Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character."
"Hey now! Don't do that! Hey what are you nuts?! Please, please! I didn't do it! I didn't do anything!","Apparently, someone sent an anonymous letter to his wife.",I didnt do anything!
You blackmailed AyersMan before he performed the surgery and then you ratted him out anyway?!,"Doesn't seem fair, does it?",I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
"You just can't control yourself, can you? No matter how stupid, how self-destructive--","To make this conversation easier, can we discard the fiction that we're talking about anything other than what I did to you?","Because, Im just, Im incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak."
"Yeah, I was thrilled about that.","Okay, it was a lousy thing to do, but if what I'd found was that Everything was all kittens and moonbeams in Markville, you'd be over it.","Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon."
No I wouldn't!,You're mad at me for letting you know what I did because you liked where things were going.,No! I would never do that! Youyoure like my brother!
"You're mad at me for letting you know what I did because you liked where things were going. And for that I actually am sorry. It was stupid. Stacy turns and leaves, House throws his head back and looks fairly heartbroken and dejected.","Let me tell you a story about a Patient He takes the earpieces out of her ears. the Patient we'll call, He checks her file. Fusan.","Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night."
It's just stress from the strep.,"Please, Chase, you and this strep. Get a room already.","Oh, I hope its just a sprain."
Points at House You House?,Umm...,Hundred and twenty points.
"Could be Hep B, Hep C, right? It's treatable. You give her interferon, she's ok. Right?",You know a lot about hepatitis.,Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
He just donated his liver.,You're flushed. You sick?,Hes a volunteer.
You sick? I'm tired.,You're hiding the fact that you're sick. Now why would you do that? He grabs Sam's right arm which has two tattoos on the forearm.,Howd you know about that?
"Hey, wait, what are you!","Now either you specifically asked for a tattoo of a heart that's been left out in the sun too long, or that is a really bad home job.","Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed."
It hasn't been active in years. She was going to die if I--,Sarcastic. You paid someone off? That is TOTALLY unethical! Get an MRI for him and his sister right now.,"Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go."
"She got Hep from me, didn't she?","No! No, no, no, God no! Serious. I think she got cancer from you.",You had sex with her didnt you?
"Just been served with papers. Actually paper one page. She reads it. Defendant Princeton-Plainsboro hospital and Dr Chase blah, blah, blah. Medical malpractice, negligence blah, blah.",You're surprised they're suing? You think people love Chase so much they're gonna just forgo--,How long have you known the plaintiff?
Larry Wusekus. He's not crazy.,Ooh! I've been sued by him.,Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.
You have been hiding things and lying to me all day!,I haven't lied about anything.,Youve been lying to me?
"I was hung-over when she came back to see me. I'd been up half the night drinking, had a headache and I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Couldn't have cared less what your sister was saying about her stomach pain.",May I speak to my future former employee?,"Okay, Ill say it."
May I speak to my future former employee?,Great story.,"Soon hell be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired."
You think I'm lying? It's exactly what I told him.,I'm sure it is. But you lied to him. You want him to sue you.,So youve just been lying to him?
I killed his sister!,I ordered black coffee this morning and got cream. Everybody screws up.,What? You slept with my sister?
They didn't put poison in your coffee.,I've seen you hung-over. You weren't the day you blew his sister's diagnosis.,"Wait, Im not just gonna drink somebodys old coffee."
What does it matter why? Is she less dead if I have a good excuse?,"If I thought you'd screwed up because you were drunk, I would have fired you.","Who cares? I mean its not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things."
"If I thought you'd screwed up because you were drunk, I would have fired you. You knew?",You were depressed and distracted. I assumed you'd gotten a phone call from your stepmom.,I dont think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
From behind him. Dr. Chase?,"Good news is, both your parents are dead now so! no reason to screw up this bad again.",You mean like through their window from behind a bush?
How'd you know?,"There's this interconnected network of computers, or interweb where you can--",Howd you know about that?
How did you know to look?,Sighs. When he visited he told me he only had two months left. When you screwed up I did the math.,This friend of mine lets call her Noelle she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York.
Why didn't you tell me he was dying?,He asked me not to.,How come you didnt tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce?
Getting angry. So you just hung me out there to be blindsided.,Softly.,"Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it."
You're not going to say anything?,"I'm going to keep my mouth shut. Legally, it's better for me if you go down in flames.","Yeah, Im not going to talk about this now."
Is Chase telling the committee about his dad?,I don't know. I thought you were going to get him to sell me out.,Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?
I wouldn't do that.,Why not?,"Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now."
You're my client too.,Yeah.,Thats my client.
Maybe you were right... maybe that is the pRoblem.,So what do we do?,Maybe thats the problem.
"After considering the testimonial and documentary evidence, this ad hoc committee in the matter of Kayla McGinley has reached a decision. Dr. Chase, your error resulted in a Patient's death. You also lied, both to your superiors and the Patient's brother. But taking into account the mitigating factor of your father's death, we've decided not to revoke your privileges. You'll receive one week's suspension and a letter in your perManent file. Chase looks reliEved. Now as for Dr. House! there is no evidence of a failure to supervise that would lead to disciplinary action. And yet, there is enough in the record to be very troubled by your conduct, House starts to look up in surprise. including certain allegations of blackmail He rolls his eyes. from members of the transplant team and by your general refusal to meet with your Patients. It should be noted that your Patient's cancer was diagnosed as the result of a direct physical examination of---","Not of the Patient, I met the brother. NEver met her. You want me to go to a family reunion Every time I take on a Patient?",Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
"The committee has determined that for no less than one month, Dr. House will have his practice supervised by another doctor, to be designated by Dr. Cuddy. This proceeding is adjourned.",To Cuddy. Did you know this was coming?,Leonard moves the meeting not occur.
What's happening to Chase?,To Chase as he walks in. Now you're fired!,Whats going on Rach?
"!Calamari is still in the lead but Ample Parking is making strides he is now in fourth, third, and holding second place while Blue Calamari is at a steady speed! Camera pans to see House watParkng the monitor. !And down the stretch they come! Ample Parking comes from behind and it's Ample Parking by a nose! House looks disappointed. This is the last call for the third race. You may still wager if you hurry. Here's your information on race number three!","Out of the way, cripple coming through.",ProAm race for the.
"Um, sixth race at Golden Downs I'll take the two and the four. Hey, that's my birthday! February 4th, 1963, you think that's a good bet? What's your birthday?","Take your time, don't worry that there's only thirty seconds to post.","You dont know my birthday, do you?"
"He wants a $2 exactabox, 2, 4, 6, 3. Give him $24. The Man fishes for money as Anica winks at House. Your turn.","Ninth at Gulf Street and Park five hundred on the 3 horse, Seminole Uprising to win.","All right, hes keys are in the drawer."
Might as well burn your money.,I'll burn my winnings. Bigger flame.,YOU BURN IT.
"Damn it! She was 14 to 1, too.","Well, fat ass over there just saved you money.","Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy."
No way Seminole Uprising's going to,"I don't bet on the horses, I bet on the jocks.","What the hell are you talking about, The south will rise again man."
"Nice to have inside information. Anica collapses, but House is busy watParkng the race.","Is anybody here a doctor? Anica is seizing, and one Man straddles her and prepares to start CPR. You trying to cop a feel?","Central Perk, Joey and Ross are giving Phoebe and Rachel the results of their election."
I took a CPR class at the Y.,That would be useful if she was having a heart attack instead of a seizure.,"Oh, I know a CPR instructor wholl come to the house."
Seizure? Hold her tongue down?,If you want to get a finger bitten off. Call an ambulance.,She wont talk so much when shes choking on my cock.
"Methodist is three blocks down, I could drive her.","Just make the call. House sees something interesting, and pulls up Anica's shirt slightly to see very discolored stretch marks/bruises.","What?! Thatthats all the way cross town, Im supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes."
What the hell is that?,How should I know? Tell the paramedics to take her to Princeton-Plainsboro. The doctor's name is House.,Aye. What we need is a girl there.
Gambling doesn't take away his pain. House enters.,"It does when I win. He throws a chart on the table. Hot OTB babe, has grand mal and inexplicable bruising. What up with that?","And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression."
You were just standing there and she started to seize?,"Spend as much time around the real people as I do, someone gets sick.",And you were directly under her the entire time?
"Hot OTB babe? Obviously a working girl, pRobably an STD, infection.","No fEver, no infection.",You ever notice you can ooze two things sexuality and pus.
"Alcohol abuse explains it all. Causes seizures and affects her blood's ability to clot, which causes bruising. Start her on heparin, she'll be fine by morning.","Except for the fact that the bruises are not peteParkal, which means it's not DIC.",It happened this morning in the parking lot.
"So the bruises were caused by trauma. She pRobably got beat up by a boyfriend, or a pimp.",What's that called when you Judge someone before Ever meeting them?,I believe thats what your roommate did to her.
She's a regular at OTB. Somehow I don't see her holding down a 9-to-5 and going to PTA meetings.,I was there. I have a 9-to-3 job.,"Yeah, she never misses these conferences!"
"It could be SLE, Familial Telangiectasia, or Even Cushing's.",Good. Start with those.,"Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. Hes dead now."
Start with those. Which one?,Cushing's. Explains the seizure and the bruising.,You start working on that list.
Not the anemia.,So she doesn't eat a lot of meat.,Dietings only half of it.
"DIC brought on by alcohol abuse is far more likely. Do a full workup, H and P, and lab her up, LP, MRI He starts to leave.","Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you just, Ever so subtly, order me to get her medical history?","Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing."
"Cuddy put me in charge last week, so yeah.","It was a pretend in charge, formality to get past the suits in Legal.",I believe we put you in charge.
"Hey, no worries. I'll let you keep your Parking space.",You can have it. You'll also need my handicap placard. Bend over.,"I know you keep saying its your space, even though theres no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting."
"Well, you make a pretty convincing argument.","Chase killed that Woman, now Foreman's in charge?",You make a very compelling argument.
Do you wear a seatbelt? Is that really relevant to a seizure?,Skip it.,I havent fastened my seat belt yet.
"How about, Were you vaccinated for polio? I think you gave me the form intended for FDR.",Looking at races. Will I like Teeny Tiny Moe in the fifth?,"Well, actually, I never was president."
"I went 4 for 6 yesterday. You want winners, cure me first. Are you generally satisfied with your life?","It does not ask that. It does, and he puts the form aside.",It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six.
You know I was going to ask what a respectable doctor was doing in an OTB parlor. Somehow that question doesn't seem relevant anymore.,What's your excuse?,"Ok Im gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about."
Turns me on.,"Yeah? What else turns you on? Drugs? Casual sex? Rough sex? Casual rough sex? I'm a doctor, I need to know.","I dont know, maybe that youd be a little upset, and then youd realize that Im a stallion that has to run free."
No sex just moved here. Haven't Even found a job yet. Don't know anybody.,"Came here without a job. That means you didn't move here, you moved away from somewhere else. He pokes at the marks on her torso. Does that hurt?","Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!"
Does that hurt? No.,Are you on prescription meds? Hormones? Prednisone?,Hmm. Does it hurt?
I already answered that one I think it was question number 20-something.,"Well yeah, and I could reach down and get it, but that would kinda spoil the whole cool move.","Ooh, okay. Didnt see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it."
I'm not on any medications.,You vegetarian?,"Now, are you sure you dont want to go see a doctor?"
"You vegetarian? No, why?","Because you might have something called Cushing's syndrome, which basically means that","Oh, OK, I dont eat meat."
"My pituitary is overproducing ACTH, which is causing my adrenal glands to push too much cortisol into my bloodstream.","What a coincidence. I'm a doctor, too.",The doctor says its completely normal with all the hormones.
"Yeah, I had it last year. They did brain surgery, removed an adenoma from my pituitary.","Huh? What did you just say? You were right, House, her pituitary tumor regrew, it is Cushing's, uncanny how you do that!.","Yes, his name is Barry, hes a doctor, thank you very much."
"Actually, it was Cameron's idea.","Nope, Cameron had three ideas. I chose one to encourage, to nurture","What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution."
"Yeah, you're all about the nurturing.",You need a hug?,"Ohohoh, yeah! Thats right, you take good care of those babies!"
I don't see any regrowth. You get her medical records faxed over?,"Work smart, not hard, that's my philosophy, boss.",Plan on growing it back?
Still don't see anything.,"Okay, so it's a micro-adenoma, too small to see.",I dont see any.
So small it's not Even there.,"Right, it's just a coincidence that I predicted a rare condition that she happened to have a year ago.","So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?"
Results from her LP back yet?,Didn't do an LP. Knew what she had. Foreman stops the test.,"Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?"
Go do the LP.,"Okay, I need you to roll over on your side, kiss your kneecaps.","Yeah, well, word of advice Bring back the comedian."
I thought it only took one doctor to do this. I'm observing.,She's here to make sure I don't paralyze you.,Nobody ever helped me.
"You've done this before, right?",Successfully?,Have you really done this before?
He's kidding. He's an excellent doctor.,"I'm gonna numb the area with some lidocaine, and then we're off to the races!","And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression."
"He inserts the needle, Anica starts and gasps. Ow.",Felt like bone. Does that hurt?,"Thats good, have a seat."
Trying rounding your back a bit more.,"You're perfect just the way you are. Oops, that was all me.",Youyou might consider pulling it down a touch.
You might want to move down one vertebra.,This is actually much harder than I remember.,Make it go taller.
"Try taking a deep breath. Dr. House, maybe I should take it from here.",Eighth time's the charm. Anica cries out again.,"Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose."
"You trying to piss off Foreman, huh?",Just let Alarm beeps.,"Jerry, get a job."
BP's 240 over 140.,"Turn that thing off, will you?","120, 180... 200."
Take the needle out. Take the needle out!,"Okay. To nurse. It's a hypertensive crisis. Start her on IV low pressure drip, titrate to systolic less than 140, she'll be fine. Cameron, meet me in my office.",Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
"Okay. To nurse. It's a hypertensive crisis. Start her on IV low pressure drip, titrate to systolic less than 140, she'll be fine. Cameron, meet me in my office.","At the risk of sounding redundant, and right, again, she has Cushing's. Cushing's.","Oh, please! Whats wrong with Helen?"
"Right, the fact that you Mangled her LP has nothing to do with it.","Actually, it has Everything to do with it. Cushing's plus stress equals hypertensive crisis. Smart move, sending the rookie.","Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny."
Her initial symptoms could have been caused by alcohol-induced DIC. She had a hypertensive crisis because it's been at least six hours since she had her last drink. She's detoxing.,The exact same moment that I'm futilely trying to give her an LP?,"I know. If she wasnt an alcoholic before, she is now."
Not as rare as an invisible tumor.,Why didn't they put you in charge instead of Foreman?,Its a pretty common one.
You ordered MRIs for the entire maternity ward?,I was in a crazy mood.,"Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctors uterus though. Mild discomfort, whats he talking about?"
"What do you expect me to do, House? Quit? Cry?","Actually, I expect you to act like what you are, my employee, my subordinate, my bitch.","Well, I guess this is kind of a bust."
"Well, since you asked nicely!","My God, I can't beliEve I got more than a year behind on my discharge summaries.",When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
"Looks malignant, pRobably inoperable. I'd give her two months.","On the bright side, it still means I was right.",What a beautiful job Stephanie did.
House assisting. That is funny. Too bad Foreman's gonna die.,Good afternoon. I'm going to be looking at your Perfect. Excuse me. Picks up phone. Need Dr. Foreman in Exam Room 1 for a consult. So when did this start?,"Yeah Joey shesRachels got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher."
A couple weeks ago. I didn't want to get pregnant. Jake's not into rubbers so I got on the jelly. You think I'm allergic or something?,You have an infection. Gonna need a sample.,"Oh no, I am a fabulous mom!"
I brought the jar.,"No, I meant a sample of your He looks up to see her holding a bottle of strawberry jelly. Oh boy. Okay, we have a neurological pRoblem here.",Right. So all we need is to
There's something wrong with my brain?,"Oh yeah. You can cover yourself up, got what I need. Foreman enters.","Ok, what is going on here?"
Foreman enters. What's up?,"Smell this. He waves the swab in Foreman's face. Smells like vaginosis, but it's not really my call.","Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts."
"Great, I'll be sure to put a gold star by your name on the board. Anica's biopsy for pancreatic cancer was negative. He leaves.","Okay, I'm gonna give you some antibiotics, and you pRobably shouldn't have sex for awhile.","Great. Yeah, Ill see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye."
"Okay, I'm gonna give you some antibiotics, and you pRobably shouldn't have sex for awhile. How long?","On an evolutionary basis, I'd recommend forEver.","Thats right, sex is off the table."
"Good news, she's not sick at all. Other than being an alcoholic.",The labs you sent yesterday put her ACTH at 64 picograms per milliliter.,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
"Chase, hold on. Chase stops.",How'd you get him trained so fast? Electronic collar? Got treats in your pocket?,You say one more word Im stopping the car.
Maybe she didn't read it because she knew there was nothing wrong with her. There is another explanation for the Cushing's maybe she injected herself with the ACTH. Her behavior suggests Munchausen's. She's had four hospitalizations in the last four months.,"Well, being hospitalized a lot certainly points to nothing being wrong with you.","On the bright side, she didnt even notice the pill."
She's had zero symptoms since she got here. The scarring on her pancreas could be caused by injecting herself with a benzene and setting off the seizures.,She's had brain surgery. You can fake a stomach ache you can't fake a brain tumor.,"Are you sure shes in the cat, or have you been taking your grandmas glycoma medicine again?"
"You can fake an invisible one. We should check her apartment. Look for medications, syringes",Venous sampling's easier.,Shes not going to see it.
And more dangerous.,Not if you get caught breaking in.,And quicker. Eh?
Why do you think Cuddy picked Foreman over me? Have I done something wrong or if there's something I needed to improve on!,Would you shut up if I told you she wanted someone black?,Im not gonna give you my job!
How would you describe my leadership skills?,"Nonexistent. Otherwise, excellent.","Okay, a little about me."
There's more to being a leader than being a jerk!,The world will nEver know. He goes to his motorbike and turns it on.,"Oh, yeah? well, theres a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!"
"No, no way. It just snowed.","Yesterday, streets are clear. He throws her a helmet.","Whoa, snowing out there?"
My car is right there.,There's construction on Elm. Bike will be faster. Cameron puts on the helmet and gets on behind House.,"Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, theres my... window, and theres my car! That your car?"
There's Even books in the bathroom.,"Well, either she's very smart or she has a sEvere fiber deficiency.",Thats nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
"She's got an appointment with her ophthalmologist on Tuesday and an appointment with her gynecologist on Thursday. Multiple appointments with multiple doctors, symptom of Munchausen's.","Or, just thinking outside the box, here, she has a vagina, and trouble reading.",She has got so much going on wewe have only two options.
Because you're looking for her to have a tumor.,And you are looking for! A person with Munchausen's syndrome drinks battery acid they don't go to an ophthalmologist to get their pupils dilated.,"Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence."
An ophthalmologist is a doctor. Attention is attention.,How Many hospitals have you contacted? Has one doctor said she's crazy? It's not Munchausen's!,"But theyre so dull, theyre all opthamologists."
It's not your call.,"If you think she's got Munchausen's then obviously you've got something to show the Man! A syringe in her apartment, a bottle of ACTH.",Alright . I think its a big mistake but its your decision.
Munchausen's Patients are good at covering their tracks.,"Oh, right, so the fact that we found nothing proves that there's something.",Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
"It's possible the surgeons just missed it. In that kind of surgery, you're just cutting and hoping",Of course!,"Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a onein700,000 chance of dying?"
Do the venous sampling. Get her consent. Cameron rolls her eyes and leaves.,"Nice move, boss. Way to cover your ass.","Let her finish, doctor."
I just agreed with you.,Not because you think I'm right.,"Yeah, I understand."
"Well, maybe longer. Would you be interested if this wasn't just pretend?",What did Mommy say I don't get any candy in my stocking?,You realize this isnt one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.
Also the sign of a sociopath. What are you doing?,"Correcting your last note. We can't discharge her, she's sick. Anybody Ever tell you, you write like a girl?",And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship youre in.
What? You got some other explanation for orange urine? It's Munchausen's.,"Correct, but not complete.","Oh, God, I hope its urine."
You just don't wanna admit that she skunked you.,"At the end of The Boy Who Cried Wolf, the wolf really does come, and he eats the sheep, and the boy, and his parents.","see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her?"
The wolf doesn't eat the parents!,It does when I tell it.,"If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits."
"You're not telling the story now, I am.","Look, I checked her records.","Oh, lets not tell this story."
There's a million things she could have taken to have done that.,True.,Whod have thought she had it in her?
She's not getting sicker.,She will!,Shes doing well.
If her bone marrow was dying the entire blood panel would be affected. Her white count's normal.,So far. We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.,Yknow howhow the nurse said thatthat Nana had passed?
"No, no more tests.","Look, you kick her to the curb with a Munchausen's diagnosis you're guaranteeing that no doctor will Ever listen to her again.","No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, were not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking."
"We do more tests we'll only be feeding her psychosis. The more attention we give her, the more she'll want.",What if she doesn't know we're testing her?,We could question her.
"House, you were wrong. Live with it.",There's pRobably some blood left over from previous tests.,The past is the past.
Blood tests alone can't confirm aplastic anemia.,"Yes, I know. That's why I want to do a bone marrow biopsy. But blood tests could show a systemic disease, viral or a toxin cause.","Ohohoh, which one is Bonnie again?"
"Fine. You wanna test the extra blood, knock yourself out. But the Patient is off-limits.",And if the results are positive? I get my biopsy? It's the safe way to go.,"Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding."
And if the results are positive? I get my biopsy? It's the safe way to go.,I need all of these tests and a PCR done on this sample.,It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
You're gonna need more blood.,Patient's empty.,"I will not fail you, blood of my blood."
Then I can't do it. She passes the sample back to him.,You can try.,"Well, I couldnt do it."
"i can try to look like Salma Hayek, that's not gonna make it happen.","You may not have Salma's ass, but she doesn't have your eyes.",Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?
No. There's no way this is going to happen. Foreman leaves.,"See him walking down that street, so I ask you very confidentially, ain't he sweet?","Nooo, hes leaving for a better job."
Fetal hemoglobin's also elevated.,"Eh, just a wee bit. Could indiCate","Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your babys birth weight pool."
"Uh, you see that in sickle-cell.",Not all sickle-cell Patients are black.,These cells come from both of us.
"None of her other blood panels showed any sign of sickle-cell, which means either something's changed drastically since yesterday, or this isn't her blood.","Of course it is! Metaphorically. Look, I couldn't do the tests. I tried, there wasn't enough blood left over. If you just let me do the biopsy!",You need to contact Holly!
"No way, I just got back from a suspension.","And if it wasn't for me, you would have been fired.",Are you okay to drive?
Why don't you just get the sample yourself? Since when do you care what your boss said?,"I don't care what anybody says, I care what they do.","Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back."
"So come on, I'll draw the enemy fire, you outflank them, get in there, get the bone marrow sample. Can't.",Who are you more afraid of?,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
"I'm not afraid of Foreman. I agree with him, all the tests back him up.",All the tests have not been done. You do realize that Blackaparte's reign is only temporary.,"In case you didnt notice, that is a scary man."
"I also realize that no matter what I do, you're still gonna treat me like crap.",Crap is a relative term.,And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
Nurses called the attending as soon as the trocar was ordered.,You used her real name?,We came over as soon as we saw.
I just processed your Patient's discharge papers. She's on her way out now.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait up! It's all right, she's going to stay.","Okay, Im going to go get your discharge papers."
"It's all right, she's going to stay. Wonderful.","Oh, bite me.","Too bad, shes leaving."
I don't need to hear the riot act again.,How'd you like another medical test?,I dont want to hear it.
How'd you like another medical test? What?,Sit.,This was fun!
Sit. Why?,So you don't crack your skull when you pass out. Just do it. You know what colParkcine is?,"If Im sitting, I dont have the option to."
You know what colParkcine is? No.,"Well, don't feel bad. It's for gout. It's got nothing to do with anything you've Ever pretended to have.","Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains."
I'm not pretending to have any,"Shut up. ColParkcine decimates your white blood cells, leaves almost no trace. Great for faking your way into hospitals.",Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
I didn't fake my way,Shut up.,You faked it?
I did not have a relative,"Shut up! I'm trying to give you what you want, and save your life. You have aplastic anemia.","All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
"What, are you trying to scare me now?",It means you're not just sick in the head.,"Ok, youre scaring me a little bit."
"So I need to know, have you been taking anything besides the insulin, the ACTH, and the pills Cameron left in your room? No.",Good. Give me your arm. House sticks her with the needle.,Have you been working out?
"It was my mom. She had MS. She was in and out of hospitals all the time. People were always trying to do things for her, bring her food, or brush her hair, make her happy. People cared. She died when I was 16. Then there was no one.",Boo hoo.,"Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didnt have anyone."
Where are you going?,"Well, I obviously can't be around when it happens.",We dont need every house in the North.
"Well, what are you gonna do, you're just gonna leave me","Relax. You know the drill. People walk by here all the time, you'll be fine. House walks back inside as Anica collapses and starts to seize.","Look, IIm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away."
We can't. Her white count's down.,"Sorry, I missed that. My hearing's been off since the Ricky Martin concert, some chulo kicked me in the head.",I dont have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
"White count, hematocrit and platelets are all off. The bone marrow's shutting down, she actually has aplastic anemia.",Say what?,What the hell?
All her other labs show nothing that,Labs schmabs. A good diagnostician reads between the labs.,Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
You were right.,"Hey, hey, hey, we're not here to play the blame game.","Chandler and Joeys, continued from earlier."
Okay. Where's Dr. House?,Turn it off.,"Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he?"
Turn it off. Now what?,How long has she been in there?,"Okay, youre not turning it off."
"Three minutes, what's going on?",She doesn't have aplastic anemia. She has an infection.,Will someone please explain whats going on here?
"No, her white count would be through the roof, hers is on the floor.",The body does crazy things.,"I dont know, it would totally depend on her coloring and You got the job!"
She had no fEver.,"Because her self-inflicted Cushing's suppressed her immune system, stopped her from having a fEver, hid the infection. Clostridium perfringens could cause the bruising, the sParkstocytes, the anemia!",Right! We have a semiprivate labor room waiting for you. So in just a minute
Explains Everything except the white count.,"Augmentin is a lot safer than destroying her immune system, why don't we try that?",There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're taking the safe course? What's going on?",There's lots of explanations for low white count.,"Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there."
Name one that fits her case.,"ColParkcine. I figured that she got her hands on it and just, uh, self-mediCated.","Okay! I was thinking if its a girl, how about Sandrine? Its French."
That's brilliant of her. Take the exact medication that would confirm your diagnosis.,People do crazy things.,I cant prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.
You injected her against her will just so you could be right.,She consented.,You told her my experiment was stupid?
She's mentally ill!,"She smells oh, so sweet.","Oh my God, shes so stupid!"
"She smells oh, so sweet.",She would have gotten sicker when I said she was gonna get sicker except Cameron dosed her with antibiotics. Just hold this.,"Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I cant remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells."
Is Everything okay?,Hold my finger.,Is everything ok?
"She should have died. House is not a hero. A person who has the guts to break a bad rule, they're a hero. House doesn't break rules, he ignores them. He's not Rosa Parks, he's an anarParkst. All he stands for is the right for Everyone to grab whatEver they want, whenEver they want. You tell doctors that's okay, your mortality rate is gonna go through the roof.","Kinda digging this whole Foreman in charge thing. Frees me up to watch my soaps, catch a movie in the afternoon, have lunch with you!",She should have cut off the traitors head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.
"Yeah, that's a big change for you.","Now Cuddy's on Foreman's ass, not mine. They walk out of the hospital together.","Wow! Congratulations, thats a really big step."
You couldn't live with Foreman as your boss.,"Why not? People could change, you know?","My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel."
WhatEver you think is best.,"Last race at Belmont, put it all on the five. To win.","Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work."
"Don't say anything don't attempt to defend your billing practices, your billing practices are indefensible.",We've been over this.,You dont need to reimburse me because Im not paying.
"If I thought you were capable of listening, I'd shut up.",That makes no sense at all.,"Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen."
Ah. Okay. Then let's go through these. He starts shuffling through the mountain of folders on the desk.,All of these?,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
"Patient, 62-yrs-old. You prescribed Viagra. I look in vain for the words 'erectile dysfunction' in the notes for Delores Smith?",She had a heart condition.,Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
And you ran out of nitroglycerin?,"She also had low blood pressure, so nitro would be dangerous. Little blue pills improve blood flow, they're vasodilators. That's why you sometimes get the headaches.","After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?"
I think Doctor House understands--,"Well of course I do. The Woman has a heart condition and she's on her own. A Man can't nail his office assistant, its national crisis time.",Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Are you seriously expecting us to foot the bill for off-label use of medication?,"Fine, I'll pay for it. He reaches for his wallet. How much are the pills? She took how Many?","If we were living in Sweden, I wouldnt have to worry about this cause wed have universal healthcare."
Are you trying to bribe me?,No! I could. There's an ATM in the lobby.,"Well, you know how I like taking bribes."
What can they do to you? And Doctor House is sorry Pointed look to House. about his earlier outburst.,Absolutely! He is pathetically insincere.,They said they were going to kill you.
Absolutely! He is pathetically insincere.,You do background checks on Medicaid personnel?,No! I mean hes nice.
I do what's necessary for my client. She checks her watch. Wow! New personal record!,"Yeah, time's good for me too got a reservation at a little place in the inner harbor.","No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies."
You booked us dinner reservations?,Best Maryland crab in... Maryland.,Want to come to dinner with us?
Don't you have a plane to catch?,Not for hours.,"All right, you know what?"
Your flight leaves at 7.,You did a background check on me?,Flights in an hour.
And mine doesn't leave until 9pm. It looks like you'll be dining alone.,"You checked on my flight, so you could be sure to be on a different one. Thought we were past the avoidance stage.","Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we wont have a night together for another week."
I didn't think we'd be finished this soon.,Where's your crucifix?,Im not finished.
I left it at the jeweler's to be cleaned.,Riiight.,"Dont worry, I had it drycleaned."
Uhhh... Looks at the caller ID. Excuse me. Picks up the phone. Hello.,"Hey Honey, how are the kids? They miss me?",Whos on the phone.
He hands the nurse a tissue and gets out of the booth he's seated in. This may take a minute.,What's new with Mr. Aphasia?,"Rachels Doctors Office, she is waiting for her doctor as a nurse enters."
Cuddy called you?,Everybody covers their ass.,"I was going to call him, but"
"Pulmonary edema. Chase did a tox screen, came back positive for amphetamines, he did the dance of victory.",I'm betting there's another shoe.,"Uh, maybe you do."
I thought the kids didn't call you.,I know the way you tell stories.,"Well, I never call me."
"Foreman went to talk to Stone about his drug test, found him running a temperature.",So it's not the drugs. He's just got such a bad rep. Ball bounces on the back of the chair again House turns around and glares at the kid AGAIN.,Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twentyfour hours.
"Honey, you shouldn't do that.","Ok, I gotta hang up. They're pRobably trying to reach me.","Dont!! Honey, what are you doing here?!"
You don't have call waiting?,I'm hanging up on you now.,Sometimes theres a lot of time between the calls.
He goes to pick up the phone. Foreman.,How high a fEver? Foreman raises his eyebrows in surprise. Put me on speakerphone. And why haven't you called me?,"We, we come back from our walk and the the phone was ringing."
He puts House on speakerphone. Scene shifts between House in the airport and Ducklings in the office. 101. How'd you know?,"What, you think you guys could have a party as soon as the parents are gone and I won't hear about it?","This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function."
What if it's auto-immune?,Well then we're screwed.,Ours doesnt need an immune system because it lives in a stateoftheart German incubator.
"The Man can't talk, his medical records are sketchy, and wife's only known him a couple of years.",MRI show anything?,A onehanded man with no family needs all the help he can get.
CT scan was negative.,"CT... that's like, short for MRI, right? Excellent, well I guess that saves us a lot of time.","Im sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge."
We've got an MRI scheduled in 20 minutes. Earliest Foreman could get the maParkne.,"I teach you to lie, and cheat, and steal, and as soon as my back is turned you wait in line?","Absolutely. But, were gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? Ill page Ross on the way. Come on."
The Man can't talk!,Who cares? He's pRobably going to lie anyway. My flight's a little late we'll be back in a few hours.,"Dwight, come on now, its time to put in the subs."
"What is the durable? Elizabeth quiets him down, he huffs. No.",Got you some coffee.,"F. Alright, whats the damage?"
"Oh, sorry. Reservation for two.","When people give themselves away, it's by little things.","Michael, youre all set at Botticellis."
"Exasperated. Oh, I told you I left it--",You keep jewelery cleaner under the sink so you won't have to go a day without it.,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute."
It's different. Yeah.,Reading a book entitled LESBIAN PRISON STORIES.,"Yeah, well, it feels different."
"Leave it alone, Greg.","Yeah, I'm good at that. So that leaves forgetting it unintentionally, but then we'd have to explain why you didn't go back for it when you realized.","Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, Im sorry, did you two want to sit together?"
I didn't realize until I got to the airport.,"Nope, you were in make-up when you got to the airport. Can't put on make-up without looking at yourself and you can't look at yourself without touParkng that thing.",It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.
Why does this matter to you?,It's an anomaly. Anomalies bug me.,Why does this bother you so much?
I'll be right back.,"I suppose it's also possible that the clasp broke, but then you'd be carrying the thing around in your purse.",Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off.
"We had a fight. She turns around and snaps at him. We had a fight and I was angry and not thinking straight, and I walked out without my make-up and without my cross! I stopped at the drug store to buy make-up, but I couldn't buy a cross because they don't have an aisle for personal talisMans!!!","Immediately contrite. So you had a fight, I'm sure it'll blow over.",At her until she kicked me out.
It was about nothing.,"Of course it was. Mark's tired, he's worried, he's got mobility pRoblems. It's normal that he'd blow up over little things.",Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
"I don't mind fighting over little things! I don't Even mind fighting over big things! That I could understand. But we fight over nothing! You know a mailbox with a sign that says last pick-up 5pm, does that mean last pick-up to go to the post office, or last pick-up to leave the post office and be sent out of town?",You fought over mail delivery? He winces.,This is stupid.
"I tried to get him to drop the subject, but he wouldn't. I told him he was right, he thought I was being condescending.",You were.,Do I detect a hint of condescension?
He's pushing me out of his life.,Maybe you're misinterpreting.,Get him out.
Did I misinterpret with you? At least this time I recognize it. That's the benefit of convincing the only two men you've Ever loved they're better off without you.,"He rolls his eyes. Yeah, it's all your fault. You know Stacy in the original Greek means relationship killer.","Fine. Ive hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. Im just trying to clean up after your mess. Well talk in the morning."
Hello? She hands the phone to House. It's for you.,House.,"Hello? No she cant come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, byebye."
Do you know your phone's dead? Do you Ever recharge your batteries?,They recharge? I just keep buying new phones.,The phones are dead.
I thought you should know your aphasia guy is tasting metal.,What's his creatinine?,But youre curious about aluminium cans?
"It's obvious we have to do the lumbar puncture, there's no choice anymore.",You have to do it just right.,"Well, I mean, you dont want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation."
What are you talking about?,"Either you've decided to do a lumbar puncture, or you have to fire me so that I can't fire all of you as soon as I get back in charge.","Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve oclock."
If I'd known you'd be out of contact--,They can handle it.,I needed to see you and I knew youd never agree to meet.
Right. So far only 3 organ systems have failed.,"Ok, they can't. Doesn't matter, guy's not stable enough to move. So go rant in your own office.",Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventyfive.
What do you mean by doing the LP just right? We're not going to screw up.,The odds are this guy knows something we don't.,"Yeah. I mean, listen if were gonna do this thing, we should do it right."
"He could know the answer to the meaning of life, the Man can't communiCate!",Have you had any indication that he's tried to communiCate something important?,"He was 84, hed say wheres my pudding?"
Have you had any indication that he's tried to communiCate something important? No.,That's cause you guys haven't scared him enough.,"No, he didnt tell me anything."
"Attention please, due to weather conditions, our flights are grounded until further notice. Cots are being provided on the lower lEvel. We apologize for the inconvenience.",Want me to run down and reserve you a cot with view?,Hey! Its raining. I dont want to fly in the rain. So
Where's your knapsack?,Checked it through.,"Umm, wheres my purse?"
"Oh, that's right. I forgot it was hard for you to carry and walk. I booked a room at the airport hotel when I saw how bad the weather was it was the last one available. Your leg can't handle a night on a cot.",Thanks. He looks shocked and stunned into quietness.,We leave in two days.
He looks shocked and stunned into quietness. I'm ready.,Right., I am ready.
The hotel's upstairs.,Does Mark know about this?,"The hotel? What, M okay."
Mark knows when things are bad I always like to have an escape route planned.,He closes the door.,"Wait a minute, why dont you just call Mark."
That I'm feeling vulnerable and I don't want to be around you because it might lead to something.,Right. But then a hotel room...,Theyre telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.
Might also lead to something.,Hmm. So... which is it?,Which leads to?
Our relationship is like an addiction. It's... like...,Really good drugs?,Hey thats what all my relationships are like.
"No, it's like... vindaloo curry.","Ok, sure...","Lets see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken."
"Really, really hot Indian curry they make with red Parkli peppers.",I know what it is! Didn't think it was addictive.,"Spicy Curry, whats that mean?"
"You're abrasive and annoying and come on way too strong, like... vindaloo curry. And when you're crazy about curry, that's fine but no matter how much you love curry, you have too much of it, it takes the roof of your mouth off. And then you nEver want to see curry for a really, really long time but you wake up one day and you think... god I really miss curry.",He puts his hand under her Parkn and raises her face up so he can see her face.,"I hear you dont like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality."
You're a jerk.,I know He smiles and dumps his cane on the bed as he moves in closer to put his hands on her waist and then leans in kiss her on the lips.,"Nope, I wasnt bitten."
Grabs his face in her hands. For once in your life will you shut up? She pulls him down and they lock lips again. He holds her close to him and she strokes his jaw as they go for it.,House.,"No, no no no, this is good."
You're on speakerphone.,How did the LP go? Give me the reader's digest condensed version.,"Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, whats going on?"
"Preliminary results are some kind of infection, which... narrows it down...","From infinity, yeah.",You leaked it?
"At the rate his organs are deteriorating, he's got maybe a day or two.",Ok!,Surely he must be dead by now.
He was trying to tell us something!,"He hesitates, then reluctantly puts the phone back against his ear. What did he say?",Whatwhat was it you were gonna tell us?
"Looking very dishEveled. You were wrong, it wasn't the fear. He opened up to me when I...",Sympathetic presence after a traumatic moment. He steps away from Stacy reluctantly. Classic interrogation technique. What did he say?,"Well maybe he was just nervous, yknow you can be very intimidating."
You knew that I'd--,"Act the way you always do? Yeah, I did. What did he say?",I knew you were not okay with that.
Now all we need is the English-aphasic dictionary.,A fluent aphasic retriEves words that are stored somewhere close to the one he wants.,Lets make that our word of the day.
He also said they took my stain?,Hold on.,Are you sure?
He takes his cane from her. Sure.,Into the phone.,"Oh, that is so hot."
Let's start this again. Bear - is it bare as in naked?,Crimson desire shows up well on sheet rock.,What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
That's why I chose it.,"Well you must have gotten one new phrase out of him, something?",That was a really good choice.
We've been talking to him for hours. Maybe he's just given up.,Are you sure you told me Everything you found in his home and office?,"Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on."
Maybe House is wrong.,Surprised. Hope that's not the end of the thought. He unplugs the charger so he can pace further afield.,"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special."
"When his wife's not in the room. Foreman and Chase suddenly realize what Cameron says is true. The more devoted, the more reason to lie.",That's cynical!,When he started the fire.
That's cynical! You disagree?,"No, I'm just kvelling.",No need for cynicism.
Your flight's been boarding for 20 minutes!,I'll take a later one.,"Guys, hurry up!"
"Greg they can't leave without you, you checked your knapsack.",Are we in?,"Theyre gone, Penny."
Are we in? Yeah.,"Hi, I'm Gregory House I'm your attending physician, your wife's not there, start talking.",Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
"They took my stain! I couldn't tackle the bear, they took my stain.","Ok, shut up now. Nice work, Cameron. Give him the list again.","Oh... come on, bear man. Come on."
Are we sure he wasn't reacting to pain? He's been on painkillers.,"Come on Chase, drugs didn't do this to him. Even if he is an addict.","Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I cant remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells."
I dissuade the tonal Category.,"Oh please. Mr. sleeping pills, amphetamines, bring me up, bring me down.","Look, I hate to be that person but I just dont like the general spirit of music."
"Will passenger Gregory House, please report to Gate 7. Gregory House to Gate 7.","Ever hear this one? Build a House, each wall has a southern exposure, big bear comes wandering by, what colour's the bear?",Oh Im afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
White. It's a polar bear you built your House in the North Pole.,"Polar. WhatEver your name is, Patient! Are you bipolar?","White, because it contains all other colors."
"Polar. WhatEver your name is, Patient! Are you bipolar?","What's that? I can't see, is he nodding?","Oh, I know, I know."
"I can't see, is he nodding? Yes.",Topamax isn't just off-labeled for weight loss.,Why are you nodding?
Except bipolar disorder does not cause seizures.,"And it doesn't shut down your kidneys, but what it does do--","Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman."
"Excuse me sir, can I see your ID?",I'm on the phone I'm on the phone,Let me see your ID.
House? Gregory House--,"Look, I'm a Doctor, and this is an emergency call.","Sookehhh. Bill Compton, from True Blood."
You'll have to come with me sir.,I'm not going anywhere.,You have to go with me.
You think you're gonna take me on?,"I kick, and I bite.",You really want to take me?
"House, you still there?","Being bipolar makes you take risks, you seek excitement. You make up stories.","Hey, are we still on for tonight?"
I dine valutate a lEver! Indignant tone.,"Fine, maybe your stories are legit.","Lets see, a lever, a lever."
Which explained nothing because it wasn't Even in the right area.,"It's not the surgery, it's the secrecy!","Oh, cause it was upside down."
House! Shut up.,What's going on?,I love Little House.
"You just don't trust me. He looks down guiltily again, she starts to cry silently.",Get some blood on a slide. Do not put it through a computer this time.,I dont know if I can trust you anymore.
"Fletch, she'll be back. Give her time to miss you.",I'm counting on you to get me off the no-fly list.,Aw. Im gonna miss her.
Is your Patient going to be alright?,"Physically, his chances are good.",Hes fine.
"Physically, his chances are good. Physically?",Two people who weren't meant to be together. Maybe they'll get a happy ending just because they both want it so much.,"If I had to put Dwights chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance."
"Yeah, that's usually the way it works.",He loved her enough to convince himself he could change.,"Yeah, Raj, thats how it works."
"But he couldn't, could he? She gets the stub of her ticket back from the person at the desk and is about to walk through when she turns around to see House again. You know what Woody Allen said about relationships? Irrational and crazy, but we go through it all because--",--we need the curry.,Do we really have to go to Mrs.
I'm on it. He goes after House.,"Morning, Jimmy. Anybody die while I was gone?",Im on it Jim.
Did -- did you iron your shirt?,Thought about shaving couldn't find a razor.,Dude! Your shirt tucked in?
What the hell happened in Baltimore?,"Sorry, Parkef. I nEver kiss and tell. They get into elevator.",What happened in Atlantic City?
there's no such thing as just a kiss.,Did you iron your shirt? Everybody's flash today.,A kiss? What are you talking about?
Are you planning on asking her to leave Mark?,Not sure. Cameron keeps my calendar.,"No, Im not leaving without her."
Hey. This is a big deal. This is an affair. Have you Even talked to Stacy about what the hell this means?,Didn't have a lot of time for talking. Blatant wink. If you know what I mean.,Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
Great. Breaking up a marriage fertile ground for high comedy. We need to talk about this. Footsteps...Cameron approaParkng.,"Gosh, wish I could. To Cameron. How did the HIV test go? Did you study up?",Hey! What do you guys think about this. Ross The DivorceForce.
I rescheduled for this afternoon. We have a new Patient. 34-year-old female. Movement disorder.,Movement disorder? Fascinating.,Sorry. I havent given her your schedule yet.
This isn't just gonna go away.,No. But maybe you will.,You know what?
"According to her husband, the flailing started before she got anywhere near that car.",What does the flailing look like?,"Well, you dont know the backstory."
Her arms spasm uncontrollably and there's a mild facial twitch.,Demonstration?,"Shes terrified, Grandmother."
"You wanna know what it looks like, go see the Patient.","Ooo, snarky. Was he like this the whole time I was gone?",What else does it look like?
Huntington's takes a day to confirm. We should put her on Tamoxifen in case it is the fertility meds. Counteract the estrogen.,"It's a great idea, if you want to kill her baby. He writes Pregnancy on board. Movement disorder can present in the first trimester.","Umm, Ill have a cup of coffee."
She's not pregnant.,Peeing on a stick is only 99% accurate.,"Cmon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, thats all."
WhatEver you want.,Lame duck's done quacking.,Anything your heart desires.

"Hyper-vigilance, sudden irritability...",Symptomatic of! lunch with Cuddy?,"Well, it was a number of things."
The Patient now defines Huntington's.,Then what do you need me for? Start her on Huntington's meds.,"All right, uh Oh hey, youve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
"If we start her on valproic acid, it could destroy her liver. Could stroke.","If we wait, she could progress to full blown psychosis. Then her kid will nEver get the chance to say goodbye. To Chase. Wanna tell the class how that feels?","They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
Huntington's Patients don't progress to psychosis in a day.,She went from 0 to 60 in world-record time. Foreman's beeper goes off.,"Still, I cant believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells."
"All the signs are there. Movement disorder, psychosis... It should be Huntington's.",Yeah.,"Well its hard to tell Oh God, if she would just stop moving."
"None of her family members are sick, nobody at her office, her volunteer group, kid's classes, and PTA members. Throws up her hands. All fine.","So she raises a daughter, runs a business, she does charity work, she volunteers at school, attends PTA. What makes mommy run?","You know, Im not the only one whos unpleasant when theyre sick."
You're thinking drugs?,Cocaine.,"Yes, its marijuana."
I'll go look for her stash.,Take Foreman. There's gotta be a reason for the stereotype.,I gotta go find her.
I know you're in there. I can hear you caring.,The door was locked.,"You okay in there, bestie?"
"It's for a Patient. She can't roll. Looks toward the balcony. Now lock that door, too.",Paranoia must be the good stuff. Sniffs. Times like these I wish I had cancer. So what did she say?,"Its locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in."
"That depends. What did you do, and who are we talking about?",We both know that as soon as we talked you ran to Stacy so you could gossip and giggle. I need to know what she said.,"What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?"
I have a crazy idea why don't you go talk to her?,Because my bestest buddy says that could lead to trouble.,Why dont you ask her?
I didn't say do her. I said do something.,What exactly did she say?,Did you do her?
She didn't say it was a mistake.,She's not gonna leave Mark in the middle of his rehab too much guilt.,"Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no."
She left you.,"Harsh toke, dude.",She really left.
"House. House turns, Wilson gestures 'come here', and House takes a joint from his pocket and hands it to Wilson.",Killjoy.,"Chandler and Joeys, Joey is opening the door, but Chandler has the chain on it."
Prescribed to her daughter.,Mommy does Everything for her family these days. Even swallows their pills.,Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
It's possible the kid's meds are the kid's meds.,"Pop enough Ritalin, it can explain Everything.",Your kids think it might be antipickle serum.
Tox screen will confirm that.,Half-life's 12 hours. The drugs'll be out of her system. We're done. Get rid of her.,How clear is the image of me on that screen?
We're not done. We have to confirm the diagnosis before we send her home to die of something else.,"Oh yes, the power tastes so sweet.","You did it, man."
"Yeah. Well, I'm still signing the charts. So until tomorrow, you're not allowed to kill anyone. Walks away.",Wuss.,Then I wont have to kill you.
We've asked her three times if she's on any meds.,So we don't ask her.,"Arent you gonna answer her, thats like the tenth bingbong message she sent."
So we don't ask her.,"Candy striper. Hooks chair with his cane pulls it toward himself. To Stella So, you like dogs? Stella nods. House whistles bends the balloon into! a shape.","Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you."
She's not on any medication.,"Well that's strange, because this bottle has her name on it. Shakes it. And I think these are medical pills inside.","Yeah, shes fed, she took her pills, shes all tucked in and watching TV."
Doctor prescribed Stella! a few months ago. I nEver told you about it because I nEver gave her any.,"Hmm. That's funny, 'cause the bottle's almost empty. To Stella. You missed a couple of days. Take five.",For Stella! Remember? Shes gettin her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Take five. Stop.,"Why? Unless they're not hers. To Stella. You need some water, sweetie?","You can take a five, if you want."
I'm not taking Ritalin.,Come on. All the cool moms are doing it. And tox screen says you're cool too. Pulls out paper and holds it out to her.,"Uh, youre really going to have caffeine in front of me when Im trying to get my life back on track?"
Should take a couple of hours to process her. Then you can take her home and divorce her.,Working late? Or are you just avoiding Mark?,"Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here."
"It was one kiss, Greg.",So far. Comes in. I'm planning on keeping a chart.,It was just a kiss.
"I'm moving back to Short Hills, I think it's time.",You're leaving?,No! The hills a trap. Lets take the dirt road off to the side.
It's nEver meant to be perManent. And now that Mark's getting better!,Yeah. Much better. Except for the whole walking thing.,"It uhh, it wont go back."
He needs to get back to work. Turns away.,Right saving the next generation from making bad choices about acne cream. You're running away because the kiss meant something.,"Chandlers office, Chandler is bent over getting some water as his boss approaches."
I'm not running away. I'm going home.,With Mark.,Im not escaping.
What's going on? Cam takes her pulse.,This better be important.,"So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera."
You've gotta come back in.,No I don't.,"Well, you have to go back in."
"Margo's stable, but--","Oh, my God. Well, I'll be right there.","Sir, its quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable."
What took you so long? It's midnight.,Traffic. Cinco de Mayo. To Foreman. You owe me a 100 bucks.,"Its getting pretty late, how come youre still up?"
You didn't take the test?,Fear trumps anal Every time.,"How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?"
It's not a big deal. I had the viral load and antibody tests. It's 99.9% that I don't have HIV.,"You have the test and it's negative, you gain a tenth of a point. But if it's positive you lose! nearly 100, right?",Thats not really porn.
No arrhythmia. So Ritalin isn't the big pRoblem. Something else is going on.,Fine. Let's play doctors.,A little dizzy.
Wouldn't explain the movement disorder.,"Nothing explains Everything. What if it's a crime syndiCate? Let's say Ritalin and the fertility meds plotted a caper. Ritalin takes care of the psychosis, the flailing--","Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?"
I still don't think Ritalin--,Fertility meds are competitive by nature. They gotta do something bigger. Something really unexpected.,A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills theyre testing.
Which could cause clots. Which could have caused her to stroke.,So ultrasound her uterus this time. See if there's something growing in there that doesn't look adorable in a onesie. They all get up and walk toward the door.,And I was thinking its only fair that you help make this decision since theyll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
So ultrasound her uterus this time. See if there's something growing in there that doesn't look adorable in a onesie. They all get up and walk toward the door.,Cameron. She turns. I love you. Her jaw drops he swabs her cheek. Get your test results tomorrow. She looks bewildered and leaves.,"Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while."
The prescription for my heart condition a bit on the cheesy side.,I was trying for roMantic. They smile at each other and hug. Still fits.,"What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?"
Still fits. Mmm.,Did you tell Mark?,"Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits."
"Am I going to tell him? Still working on that phrasing. How about 'Know all that stuff you were worried about when we first came here, Honey? You were right.'",Pithy.,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?"
Everything's easy when you don't care if you hurt anyone.,You already did the hurting part. He just doesn't know it yet.,Its easy. Thats what Im saying.
"No endometrial thickening, no masses. No cancer.",She's on fertility treatments. She had a blood clot. It's there.,"Yeah, yeah, Im a gynaecologist."
"Millions of women are on fertility treatments, and they don't get cancer.",Right. They get babies. She had a blood clot and a stroke. She'll get another one and pRobably die if we don't find that tumor. Do an endometrial biopsy.,Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
We just did an ultrasound. What?,Shh.,"Okay, everything looks good."
If you have a personal issue that's interfering with--,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.",My struggle is emotional.

What's wrong with your foot?,War wound.,I am hurt.
Does it hurt?,Every day.,"Right, is it painful?"
That's what my parents say when they don't want me to know something.,They say that a lot?,Then why cant we tell your parents?
They don't fight.,Not Ever?,Theyre still fighting.
People who love each other don't fight.,Right. Forgot that. The elevator arrives. What floor was that nurse on who was watParkng you?,What if the fighting is the reason were making progress?

I'm here about Stacy.,What about her?,Here... Whos here?
I think I'm losing her.,"Your wife, your pRoblem. Walks away, Mark rolls after him.","I really felt like I almost lost her, andand nothing is worth that."
She won't talk to me.,"So what, you're gonna talk to me instead? Talk to your shrink.","Honey, you gotta talk to her."
She keeps saying Everything's fine.,Find a bar and talk to a stranger.,"No, shes not okay?"
You're the only one who's been through this. House stops and turns. I'm shutting her out. I'm saying things and then hating myself for saying them. How did you get past that?,Didn't. Turns and walks away again.,Walk out of the house.
Can you please be a huMan being for one minute and talk to me? House stops and turns again.,"Sorry gotta go, people dying. He turns and walks away.",Hello. Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
House. Mark comes in and pulls himself out of his wheelchair onto the stairs. House turns and looks at him.,You're not ready for this.,"Chandler and Joeys, Chandler is entering."
I've seen the way you and Stacy talk to each other.,You're an idiot. You pRobably just set your rehab back three months.,"Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?"
"Let go of me! Get off of me! Mark falls down the stairs, sitting on them. House goes back down and through the door, leaving Mark sitting on the stairs.",Liver tumor doesn't make sense.,"Monas Apartment, she and her date are making out as Ross flips through a magazine while lying behind the couch and sees something that he likes."
You saying the CT was wrong?,I'm saying the symptoms don't add up.,"Now, is it too dark to say that Cicis having an operation?"
Side effects of the Ritalin caused the--,No.,"According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack."
She's a people pleaser. She doesn't like to let people down.,NEver fights with her husband.,"Um, shes easy to talk to I guess and shes got a really good sense of humor."
She went to drugs instead of asking for help to Manage her life.,"So if she can't Manage now, why does she want another kid?","I dont know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch."
"So if she can't Manage now, why does she want another kid?",Foreman.,"You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family."
I'm not saying anything until the metaphor plays itself out.,So here's the caper.,"Look Im sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence."
Birth control pills? They all exchange bewildered looks.,"While the surgeons are cutting out a chunk of your liver, should I have them do a hysterectomy too?","I called the sperm bank today, they havent sold a single unit of Tribianni."
A hysterectomy? I'm trying to get pregnant.,You don't have to lie to me.,Youre talking about my hysterectomy.
What makes you think that I don't--,Because it fits. Birth control pills caused hepatocellular adenoma. Explains all your symptoms that aren't explained by your other lies.,"Well, II thought I did but, II guess I did not!"

What are you going to tell my husband?,That I'm canceling the surgery.,What do you tell him?
Could--could I die on the table?,Could you die if you tell him the truth?,No. I mean I cant physically. I cant get on the table.
You can't cancel the surgery.,"If she goes off the pill, the tumor goes away on its own.","Tell you what, the surgerys not for a week, Ill think about it."
"You have no proof the birth control pills caused this, you have no proof she's Even taking them.","Well if we do the surgery, maybe we'll kill her on the table. Then I can prove I'm right at the autopsy.","And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people."
"Or, we can forget the surgery, let the tumor grow, and kill her.",Why don't you take it up with Stacy? See which option minimizes your risk.,Whats the difference between Meredith and Michael Jackson?
"Here's what I think she's gonna say. Beta Comment Doing a dang funny Stacey impression. Oh, I love Greg. But if you go against a Patient's wishes, you're calling her a liar. And if something goes wrong, I end up in court having to defend the big mean doctor, albeit with dreAmy eyes, who wouldn't beliEve the nice suburban mom. And Even though his cane makes me melt, do the damn surgery. She sits down, scoffs and rolls her eyes.",Shocking. It's benign.,"Okay, what did Amy tell you?"
People do crazy things for love.,No. Crazy is hanging out in the Park all day talking to pigeons. Margo knows what she's doing. She gave up half her liver to save her marriage.,"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
"No, she surgically removed her fingerprints to cover up her pathetic lie.","It's twisted and Manipulative, I give you that. But it's also...roMantic. Wilson looks at him like he's nuts.

Do we need to talk?,Nope. I'm fine.,Are you going to let me talk?
"You don't know. Smiles. In a few years, we'll give up. Stop trying to get pregnant. We'll hug cry. Eventually, Ted will stop thinking about it. And he'll appreciate Stella Even more. And we'll live happily together for the next 50 years. Smiles and looks satisfied. Foremen looks sick.",Something you need to see. He holds out envelope. She looks at him nervously. Knowing is always better than not knowing.,"Honey, yknow I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing youre having these babies for Frank and Alice."
It's a referral request.,Right. HIV thing came in earlier. He holds it up. You're fine.,"Uh, that is an invitation to an online party."

What did you tell her?,I told her she's better off without me.,"What, you told her?"
You're an idiot. You don't think she'd be better off without you.,Right. I sent her off on a whim.,"Aw, so I guess if it werent for me, youd still be living with her, huh?"
You have no idea why you sent her off. House climbs down off the wall.,Don't do this.,Why the hell did you take her?
Watch the line.,"Deia rei marki. Deia rei marki! Pronouncing something out of the book, Foreman enters.",I cant believe you didnt know it was a line!
Been looking for you.,Been avoiding you. Burn unit can handle it.,Havent seen you in a while.
"If they could handle it, they wouldn't be asking for you. Foreman takes out his mobile phone to check something then he tosses the Patient's file into House's lap. House rolls his eyes. Is that a Journal?",Friend wrote an article.,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr."
Friend wrote an article. In Hindi?,They have a cutting edge neuroscience program in India.,Could you say that in English?
Tachycardia can be explained by the burn.,I assume the burn unit knew that.,Have you ever seen a burn victim?
I assume the burn unit knew that.,His potassium's low.,Have you figured out what started the fire Mr.
Which can also be explained by the burn.,"Except I'm sure the burn unit's pumping him with fluids, which means his potassium should be going up, not down.","Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot."
Could be amphetamines.,Or a bacteria lunParkng on his heart or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing. He needs an EKG.,Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
Or a bacteria lunParkng on his heart or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing. He needs an EKG.,"Eww. 'Kay, no skin, no EKG.","$5,000 for a couple of dolls?"
Is he Even going to survive the burn?,What have you got a date or something?,"All right, but ifif he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!"
We need help from a Belgian doc named Eindhoven. He's dead.,While he was alive he invented a little ditty called the galvanometer.,"Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD."
Where do we get one?,Go to an electronics store that's been open since before nineteen-o-five. There's a good chance they got one in the corner of the basement.,"Yeah, really? Ive seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, its weird?"
"Well, when she gets here, fire her.",Seemingly pleased with the results. Oh yeah!,I want to be here when you fire her ass.
Walks in. Did you issue this memo?,Look at that.,"Alright. Oh, did you see my memo by the way?"
"Has no idea what she's meant to see. Congratulations, the Patient that has been in a coma for 2 years and counting is still in a coma. This is not my signature I don't know anything about this guy. I'm supposed to introduce him, have lunch? Lots of red lights on the screen now. The coma Patient has a migraine?","Oh no, no, no, no, no I gave him medication to prEvent a migraine.",The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card.
"That's a migraine, increased flow velocity in his cerebral arteries.",I did subsequently give him nitroglycerine which could possibly--,"Youre getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain."
You induced a migraine headache in a coma Patient?!,"Gave him a little headache, similar to the one you're giving me now.","At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery."
Have you Even read an ethical guideline?,Well if you are to try out a new migraine prEvention medication on someone who can actually feel pain...,"Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma Im having."
Did you sign this?,Errr... yeah. Grabs his cane. We can talk later about the appropriate discipline. Gives a low sexy growl and then limps out.,"Arg... Alright, Ill take care of it. throws hands out in the air"
Into the intercom. Anesthetist get in here.,Walking in. Who electrocuted my Patient?,From the intercom.
He wasn't electrocuted.,SearParkng through some books on his shelves. What does the seizure tell us? Turns around to see Chase leaning against the desk. Move.,"If youre referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity."
What are you looking for?,"Same as you - love, acceptance, solid return on investment. SearParkng the papers on the desk. Differential diagnosis, go.","Okay, let me tell you what were looking for."
"Could be MS, seizures could be caused by plaques and lesions on the brain.","Finally finds the file he was looking for on another table and picks it up. Well let's find out which, get an MRI. Walks out.",He looks like your twin.
No nuclear imaging. House walks back. He wouldn't survive the move to radiology. MRI and CT scan are both out.,Big sigh. Ok. Lumbar puncture will tell us if his proteins are elevated and at least we can exclude MS. Walks out again.,"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground?"
Can't do a lumbar puncture either. House walks back in again.,"You're cramping my exits. Don't tell me, no skin on his spine.",I dont think I can walk right now.
There's no other way to look at a brain.,Transcranial doppler sonography.,I know. Although Ive always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
"She said brain, not pregnant Woman's uterus. They do sound alike.",I used one to look at a brain this morning.,Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
"Why didn't you take the Patient to radiology, get an MRI?",Looks behind to check if anyone's listening in. Obviously I was doing something illegal and using nuclear imaging would have raised questions.,"Oh, yeah. Shes hot."
You're not going to get a diagnosis of MS from a sonogram!,"Not definitively, but Patients with MS have more reactive neurons in their occipital cortex. He walks out yet again, but quickly peers back in. Ok then.","Anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow."
"You've nEver been to one of these things in your life, who is this guy?",He shrugs. No idea.,Who the hell is this?
What's with the outfit?,"Sudden Parklls, and light sensitivity. Inexplicable.",Why are you dressed like that?
Looks thoughtful. Hmm! He must be good. You went to Hopkins and studied under BrightMan and Gilmar.,Shhh...,No. He was one of my professors in college.
"You were supposed to get the Doyle internship. He looks between House and Weber, suddenly realizing. This guy's von LieberMan?! The guy got you thrown out for cheating?",The Dean threw me out. Von LieberMan just ratted on me.,I think I faked Stanley out too.
"This guy's name is Weber, not von LieberMan.",I call him Weber von LieberMan. Way eviler. Shh.,My mistake. Hes an old friend of mine.
So what's the plan? You going to wait 'til he bends over then make a fart sound?,"I'm not here about the past, he's a bad scientist.",Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
"Well you cheated off him, how bad can he be?",He got the answer wrong.,"Well, I know he didnt cheat on you, so what happened?"
Uhh... you stalked this guy for 20 years just for this shot to humiliate him?,Shh! I'm trying to learn.,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
--vessels without significant rebound. He continues in the background.,He doesn't Even know what that means.,"Im sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter."
"You're going to interrupt him, aren't you?",If I have a question.,"Come on, Michael."
And what's that going to accomplish?,Why can't you just enjoy this? Why can't you just be happy for me?,How is that going to help them?
You have got to find less Debilitating outlets than humiliating people! I... hear bowling is more fun than stalking.,But I'm better at this.,No. Stalkers are creepy. Im just a harmless little girl with militarygrade spy equipment.
We found a subarachnoid bleed.,Bleed in the head isn't causing seizures.,Are you drunk?
There's no way to tell without--,Slightly too loud. Shut up!,I suppose theres only one way to find out.
Stops and turns around. Excuse me?,Not you.,Theres the waitress.
You know if my lecture is interrupting your meeting I can wait.,Bahut shukriya Thank you very much.,"Well, were a little early, the lecture doesnt end for 15 minutes."
"And with a P value of less than point zero zero one, we have strong statistical evidence that this drug prEvents migraine headaches without daily administration.",Err... excuse me doctor.,Its amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Mutters to House. He knows his field better than you do.,"It's always been my understanding that err, unless you follow a daily regimen, no drug can prEvent a migraine.","Hey, Stanley. I dont tell you how to do your job, do I? He..."
That's why they call it a breakthrough.,That's why YOU call it a breakthrough.,"Oh, dont play the Einstein card."
"No, the... err pharmaceutical company sponsoring my clinical trials also hails it as a breakthrough.",I'm sure your wife and Lawyer do too. Is there anybody who doesn't stand to make a fortune from it calling a breakthrough?,"Whats going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy."
Mutters to House. Just a lunatic who desperately needs a hobby.,And how exactly did these studies work?,Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
"We had a very specific control group. Chronic migraine sufferers, I don't have time to go through all the math right now but the incidence was dramatically--","Sure, in India. Two plus two equals five there, right?",I cant answer that without collecting additional data.
Do I know you?,I know your math skills. They blow.,Does anybody know me?
You sound very familiar.,"Why did you publish it in an obscure journal in India? Why not publish it in really, really cool head cases of South Philly?","Oh, well, you know, now, now that Im hearing it, it does sound familiar."
Neuroscience New Delhi is a respected journal.,Yeah. The guy running Slurp 'N' Gulp tells me its one of the best.,"Well, that is one of my degrees."
Mutters to House. Get a hooker. Anything.,See I'm thinking that publishing studies is pRobably the easiest way to get a pharmaceutical company to give you a reach around.,"I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it."
Has been walking up the steps closer and closer to House. I know I know you.,Sure you do. Dick.,Is he really coming?
The name's Phillip.,"Oh, my bad. Something to do with your face. I always think your name is Dick.","Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Whos Phillip?"
I always think your name is Dick. Realizes. House?!,Here.,"Its a name, yeah."
"Medical school was 20 years ago, give it a rest, grow up.","Yeah, you were always the grown-up. Do the responsible thing. Tattletale!","Its alright Pete, you can handle it."
Tattletale! You cheated!,"I cheated then, you're cheating now! Your drug doesn't work.","Oh, youre such a cheater!"
"Oh yes, you would like to beliEve that because it plays right in to your fantasy.",I tested it.,"Well, thats easy for you to say."
Oh really? What were your parameters? Where's your study?,Quickly looks over at Wilson. Room 2134.,Really? Whats the hypothesis?
"You haven't changed a bit. You took shortcuts in Med school, you're taking shortcuts now. You cannot test this on an abnormal brain.","That's so close-minded. He's not abnormal, he's... special.","Hey, Ive been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years."
Adam had an orgasm.,What?,"When he finished, he shouted Eureka!"
"House's expression could really either be interpreted as immense pleasure of the orgasmic variety, or immense pain. What's wrong?",I'm having a migraine.,"Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure."
Are you ok?,Hah. Yes. I was right. A strong burst of pain hits him hard and he groans before pushing his clenched fists against his forehead.,Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasnt so mutual after all. Yeah?
It'll knock you out for a couple of hours.,"Weakly. No, I got work to do. Just give me sumatriptan for the pain and Verapamil so it doesn't recur. I heard the Patient had fun in the hyperbaric chAmber.","I made a booboo, all right?"
I heard the Patient had fun in the hyperbaric chAmber. Yeah.,Gotta schedule me some time in there.,"Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks."
Takes the bottle of Weber's cure from House's hand. Weber's meds aren't Even legal in the US.,It's legal in India. I was disoriented.,What does that mean?
Err! moving around is a bad idea. Hey if you feel chest pain you need to let me know. Verapamil can cause congestive heart failure.,Nothing can hurt my heart.,Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid buildup.
"Hey you're going to feel some dizziness, definitely going to be constipated.",Differential diagnosis for getting off. Sits himself down on a chair at the big table.,You know Im doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy!
"No, something's seriously wrong with him. He draws a circle on the side of his forehead in the almost-universal gesture of a crazy person.",Pushes the chair aside and lies down on the floor under the table.,"No... no. Hes holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. Whats that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What havent you guessed?"
"We're not stalling you, we just don't know. The Ducklings all take seats around where their mentor lies.",Then guess.,Just... quit stalling.
Could pain medication cause an orgasm?,I wish.,"Orgasms, why can women have them?"
Most people don't orgasm from a needle prick.,Actually Chase has a point the brain is like a huge train station.,"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?"
"If sensory information got misinterpreted by the medial forebrain bundle, it's possible for bad to feel good and good to feel bad.",He's a lucky kid. Let's not fix him until the burns heal.,"And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust."
"Crab's disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy.",All very bad things. No way to look for any of them in his condition.,"What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster."
"He's on 20 different medications to Manage his pain and his heart, how often he urinates. His brain is like a waiter that's got too Many--",Heyy! I do the metaphors.,"Ugh, all right, Ill go."
"So we just wait for his burns to heal to see if you're right? If you're wrong, he doesn't have that kind of time.",Dominic Larrey.,"No, no, lets see how long it takes him."
He another dead doctor?,He was Napoleon's Surgeon in Parkef. Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.,"Thisthis Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?"
By amputating legs.,And with bugs.,By putting one foot in front of the other.
"Maggots eat dead flesh, only dead flesh, so they're perfectly suited to clean wounds. They also kill the bacteria that thrive in injured tissues.",Ohh! He grimaces.,"Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs?"
"Standing there with hands on his hips. Dr. Jekyll I presume, they found a half-eaten sheep in the zoo, police wanna ask you a few questions.",Points at the mug. Need something to wash it down.,"The Animal Hospital, the guys have taken the duck in to remove the ring."
Coffee? Bad idea. He raises his voice deliberately so the volume almost sounds like shouting - obviously he's trying to torture poor House with his migraine. You're better off with water.,Coffee's closer.,"Oh coffee, thats too much."
"Grabs the mug before House and dashes off into the conference room. Fool-proof plan by the way. Either his meds would work and you'd be in psyParkc pain because von Evil is going to be rich. Or they wouldn't, and you got to be in agony all day. Wilson pours a glass of water for House, but takes all the teaspoons on the counter and dumps them into the sink deliberately with a LOUD clang. House grimaces again. Perfect lose-lose situation. Very you.",I had to prove--,"Howard, the poor thing just got home from work."
You proved nothing. He hands House the glass of water.,Right. This isn't a migraine.,So? I didnt offer you water. Whats he doing here?
"Yeah. Dear New England Journal of Medicine, I took this guy's drug and still got a headache thus scientifically proving that my archenemy is an idiot. You just wanted the pain.",The meds are supposed to prEvent migraine.,"Yknow what, hes right."
"You get distracted by pain, leaves less room for the things you don't want to think about, like the Flyers sucking or the price of gas or... ohh, the fact that you pushed the love of your life out of your life.","God I wish the pain, Turns his head to give Wilson a pointed look. would go away.",That youre having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
Did you sleep here?,Suddenly wakes up and looks at the Ducklings all looking worriedly at him. Lower.,Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Whispers. Do you want a pillow?,"Not softer, lower. Frequency of your voice is grating.",Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
You should have been better by now.,I'm super. Patient?,"Im not going to get any better, you know?"
The maggots did great for the burn Sighs. but the brainwaves are still all over the map.,"Which means your regular old infection isn't causing his brain dysfunction, which means there's an underlying condition which means we gotta get inside his head. Do a lumbar puncture.","You can still smell the burning bodies, and thats where your head is at."
We've already established that we can't get a lumbar puncture.,"C2, C3.","Well, we dont have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength."
"No, no, NO way. I only saw a cervical tap once and that guy got paralyzed.","Ask the parents if they prefer to have their son in a wheelchair, or dead.","Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse."
He doesn't have MS or an infection.,His proteins aren't elevated?,Hes got this thing.
"Wrong protein. IGM, not IGG. Elevation was pRobably caused by the bleed.",What if there was tingling in his extremities prior to the crash?,"Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page."
How can you still be on MS?,"I gotta be on something. Something's interrupting his neurons Parktchat, like lesions.",And how are you on this fine
"We can't scan for them, the only test we can do, we just did and it was negative. He has no tingling, no numbness. And you read his history parents didn't say anything about--",What about Adam?,"Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?"
We can't look into his brain but you want us to read his mind?,Good point.,"You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
We can't look into his brain but you want us to read his mind? Good point.,"Yeah, you can finish the sponge bath in a minute.",I dont think he can see us.
They're just re-doing his dressings. He's out. He's fine.,I didn't page you to put him out I paged you to wake him up. Why are these lights so damn bright?,"I dont know, Howard isnt really the family fun kind of guy."
I didn't page you to put him out I paged you to wake him up. Why are these lights so damn bright?,"Thank you. Come on, I need to talk to him.","You see, you look beautiful."
"House, you can't wake up a burn victim to play 20 questions. It's torture.",He won't remember.,Why dont you turn it up?
He's going to be in extraordinary pain!,"God you're good, you're putting me to sleep! I know he's going to be in pain, I know you disapprove, I'm his attending. Wake him up.","In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."
Oh my god!,I'm Doctor House.,Excuse me?
I'm Doctor House. It hurts!,It's going to get a lot worse so answer fast.,"A doctor? Well, I hope youre not contagious. Ive got a weekend in the telescope room Ive been excited about for almost three minutes."
It really hurts!,Any tingling in your arms or legs?,Its really starting to hurt.
Can you do something? I can't..!,Adam! You gotta listen to me! Did you feel anything?,"Look, can, can you do something for me?"
Is he ok?,Get Everyone in my office. He limps past her.,"Chandler, where are your tools?"
Where are you going?,Kid's screaming gave me a headache. Gotta take an aspirin.,Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
"House, you ok? We've been waiting for you.",He slowly looks up at her. I'm hallucinating.,Thank you for letting us see the house again.
She puts her stuff down hurriedly. Hallucinations with migraines are pretty uncommon. She checks his pupils. What did you see?,I saw music.,What do you see?
Sensory deception makes no sense.,"Shhh... We see Cameron through House's eyes, she's all blurred up. We also hear her from House's ears and she echoes badly.","I think if I were manipulating you, youd be smart enough to see it."
Past that. He's seeing sounds. Took something.,"Why's it so dark in here? Beautiful day outside, open the shades, let the sun shine in.","He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything."
Its night time.,"It's still Tuesday, right?",It is starting to get dark out there.
You look better.,I took something.,I think you look nice.
Mind if I ask what?,"Err... a little of this, little of that. And I was wrong with our Patient, he's depressed.","Alright, could I just ask you one question?"
He told you that when you woke him up?,Nope. Told me he pissed his pants and he blacked out.,I had just woken up.
"That's not diagnostic of depression. Lack of appetite, isolating yourself--",Uncontrollable urination and blacking out are good predictors of what?,"Well, not so much depressed as lonely."
Uncontrollable urination and blacking out are good predictors of what? Seizure.,Which means the seizure he had when you tested his heart was at least a second seizure.,"The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine"
So what? Depression and seizures aren't correlated.,"No, but you know what is? Depression and anti-depression medicine.",Its really hard to demonstrate depression.
Tox screen was clean.,"Yeah, but you know how much crap he's got in his system from dealing with those burns, the guy could have the Spanish Armada floating through his bloodstream and we wouldn't know about it.","Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
Antidepressants have been known to cause seizures in kids but not orgasms. This is a brain in trouble.,This is a brain with too much serotonin.,"Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure."
"Serotonin affects mood, appetite, it doesn't cause a brain to shut down.",Antidepressants fake brains into thinking they have more serotonin than they actually do.,"Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gammaaminobutyric acid."
Where are you going?,"Going to talk to the kid again, seems nice.","Ohh, big, fat bummerrr."
"Going to talk to the kid again, seems nice. You can't.",Why? Did he say he doesn't like me?,Just want you to know I didnt mean to be rude about your grandson.
Anesthesiologist told the parents what you did.,Everyone's a tattletale. He switches off the lights in the office and leaves.,Hello? They gave me a BandAid. Hospitals do not issue BandAids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
Everyone's a tattletale. He switches off the lights in the office and leaves.,Is your son depressed?,"This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it."
"No, who are you?",I'm doctor House.,Yeah. Who are you?
I heard him screaming all the way down the hallway!,"If I didn't wake him, I wouldn't have learned what caused the crash. We think he had a seizure.",I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find him anywhere!
Long pause. This wasn't my fault?,"Well if he hadn't had the brain pRoblem, he wouldn't have the burns.","You guys, it wasnt my fault."
He's the happiest kid I know.,"But you don't know, do you?",He looks happy.
He's my son.,"Hmm... that's sorta my point. At sixteen, they'll tell anyone anything, except their parents.",I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
Adam talks to us about Everything.,"Yeah, I know about the pot and the cocaine.",How long have you known Adam?
There was nEver... cocaine! What!,You sure? Are you having him followed?,Theres no gum.
He told us when he got drunk at a party he told us when he started having sex--,Sixteen. Way to go.,When? When did he tell you? Today?
He told us when he cheated on a math test he told us when his girlfriend cheated on him! He doesn't hide anything from us.,But if he was depressed...,He doesnt tell me anything!
"He'd tell us. We don't Judge, he's not depressed, we're sure.",Bet-his-life-on-it sure? Just hypothetically.,"Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad."
Just hypothetically. Yeah.,Okay.,"Oh, no, no."
Yeah. Okay.,"Kid's happy happy, happy, happy.","Oh. Yeah, okay."
Then we're back to where we started. Seizure disorders.,Seizure disorders aren't causing orgasms.,"Yes, were back to our own time."
Seizure disorders aren't causing orgasms. Vascular malformations?,Would have seen it on the sonogram.,"If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was fortytwo."
Would have seen it on the sonogram. Hepatic encephalopathy?,Shakes his head. Liver enzyme tests were normal. He looks like he's thought of something and gets up to go out again.,"you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, its so healthy Im always like is this moving to fast?"
Where are you going?,To take a leak.,"Yeah, it was."
What are you doing?,"Can't come in here, you're not sterile.",They only had regular yoghurt.
"Don't touch our son, we told you!","Seriously, millions of bacteria, micRobes on you. He'll die of sepsis.","Hey, dont touch him, please!"
I know he is. He rushes into the prep room and quickly tries to wash his hands. House! You can't do this!,Oh if I had a nickel for Every time I've heard that.,"Come on, hes still in the bathroom!"
From outside the room. Leave him alone!,You're not sterile do you want to kill the kid?,"Well, there is one way."
Give me the syringe.,"Prepares to use the syringe. No pain, no gain.","Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now?"
Hey! He grabs House's arm. You gotta stop this!,"Has paused by that point and is inspecting something on Adam's wrist. They're right, he's not depressed.",Oh wow! Hes so lifelike! Unbelievable! He starts tugging on the guys ears.
"Yeah sure, I'm not letting you go until you give me that syringe.",What's that on his wrist?,"Yeah, thank you."
He looks down at it - it's a circular burn mark on Adam's wrist in the middle of what is otherwise unblemished skin. A burn.,Why on his wrist?,"Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!"
Why not on his wrist?,"His back, his torso, Everything's a mess, forearms are clean. Except right there.","You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning."
Except right there. So what?,It's a perfect circle.,Its where the action is.
"So a drop of burning gasoline fell on his wrist, a screw from the ATV He Manages to finally get the syringe from House.",Maybe. He inspects Adam's fingers and finds a yellow nicotine stain on the side of Adam's middle finger.,"He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6."
Why are you torturing him?,Does your son smoke?,Youre torturing the poor boy.
I'd kill him.,Smiles.,"You wouldnt let anyone kill him, would you?"
Quitting smoking can kill?,No-smoke meds are antidepressants.,Thats not true.
"Walking in. Hey, did you drop acid?",Swivels his chair around. Why would I do that?,Okay to come in?
"To annoy me, or maybe because you're miserable, or... because you... want to self-destruct. Pick one.",How about because LSD acts on serotonin receptors in the brain which can stop a migraine in its tracks?,"Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way."
Cameron is worried about you. I told her that LSD lasts up to 12 hours if you were functional she must be wrong.,"Well, either that or I also took a whole bunch of antidepressants which short-circuited the LSD. I'm just saying that would also explain it.",You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.
Thank you for ruining my clinical trials. Pharmaceutical company is shutting me down.,"You're kidding, really?",So do you know what kind of research youll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
"How could that surprise you? You sent them an email complaining about my math, telling them about your stunt.",I didn't know people actually read emails. The delete button is so conveniently loCated--,"Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that Im great at surprises."
So what's next? You going to follow me my whole life? Torture me?,Why would I do that?,Should I follow you?
You waited 20 years to do this. What's next? Break up my marriage?,No. We're Even.,Ive kept my marriage together for 35 years.
"Right. He starts to walk out, then stops and looks at Cuddy. Oh thanks, for setting me up. He walks out, Cuddy gives House a disbelieving look.","An eye for an eye, LSD and antidepressants.","The hallway, Penny exits the guys apartment."
Universe always settles the score. Does it?,"No, but it should.","Not really, no."
Will you? I'm Paula.,Hey Paula.,"I will. Hey, Bernadette?"
How you doing? You work over at the college? Or are you full-time over at the--,"I'm looking for a distraction. You don't need to talk to do that, do you?","Hey, I work at the same university you do."
How'd you get here?,By osmosis.,How did you get here in the first place?
By osmosis. No helmet?,Didn't seem like riding weather.,Remove your helmet
And the fact that you can barely stand upright had nothing to do with it?,Infarctions hurt that's what they do.,"Um, I had scoliosis as a girl."
"Worsening pain could actually be a good thing, means the nerves might be regenerating.","Could be good, could be bad. Thanks for the differential. Any other options?","Im sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?"
Have you Ever considered a career as a motivational speaker? Why don't you check out some rehab?,I did the rehab thing.,Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
One session and you didn't Even finish that session.,The guy wanted me to visualize the healing. e opens his pills. I can do that at home.,"Thats honest. Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasnt it?"
At least let me get you an MRI.,"It's a very simple equation more pain, more pills. He takes a pill.",I will loan you the money.
"Teenage super model. Presented with double vision, sudden aggressive behavior, cataple--",You had me at teenage supermodel. He enters the elevator.,Blindguy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character Ive been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him.
"You okay? She nods, House enters.",Wow you should be a model. Are you really 15?,"I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?"
Who are you?,I'll be the one saving her life today assuming she's dying. Who are you?,I need another drink.
Any idea what's wrong with her?,"From the looks of it, not a single thing. I pRobably should stop staring and check out the file. So what set off the brawl? She stand in your light?","well, the good news is no more guilty conscience."
"Look I know some models are notorious for hissy fits, but Alex, I've nEver Even seen her get angry. Even when she was a kid she was--",I'm sure she was delightful in her youth. And then you passed out.,"Because a lot of people think that models, even though theyre very attractive, are somewhat vapid."
I was passed out but I wasn't. I... I knew what was going on but I couldn't move or talk.,"Yeah, sounds like a medical thing. It's called cataplexy cat fight and cataplexy on the catwalk. Cool. How much were you drinking?",How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
She only had one sip of champagne. House rolls his eyes.,Forget it. We'll find out from the tox screen.,Back in the restraunt.
"All right, look, I gave her a valium. You think that's what did this?",No. How long have you had the sweats?,"Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her."
A couple of days.,Any other complaints?,A couple hours.
"Uh, my stomachs been bothering me, and I've been feeling a little nauseous.",Okay.,Can you put me down Im getting a little nauseous?
Since when do you voluntarily go see Patients?,Have you seen her?,When was the last time you went to the doctor?
Have you seen her? She's fifteen.,"Yeah, but there's something about her. Something in her eyes, a kind maturity.",She was 11 the first time I saw her.
"Yeah, yeah, she's an old soul. This is creepy Even for you.","She's a fashion model, on the cover of magazines.","Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!"
"Did the history rEveal anything, oh I don't know, medically relevant.","History. Right, knew I was forgetting something. You should do one of those while you're writing the labs and the tox screen. He hands her the file.","Whuhah! Woah! You cant talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and Im gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now."
There's no age limit on addiction.,He's right.,"Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!"
"Or bulimia, or her age. Some girls don't start till their mid to late teens.","Evidence to the contrary the rounded hips, the perfectly sculpted bountiful breasts.","Well, some girls go through a phase."
Implants. I've seen some of her photos. They've grow dramatically since last summer.,Symptomatic of turning fourteen. Two clinic hours says that those love apples were hand crafted by God. Foreman scoffs.,"Man, dont be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!"
I thought you didn't beliEve in God.,I do now.,I dont care what people believe.
Could we talk about her health instead of her breasts?,Could be relevant.,You dont need to go any further.
"Even if she is an addict a lot of her symptoms, the cataplexy, the violence, they could be neurological. We chalk this up to drugs we could be releasing her with juvenile MS, or Parkinson's --",Detox her.,But shes had a bad influence.
Fine. We'll set her up on a program they'll wean her onto the methadone.,And in four weeks we'll know you're right.,As it turns out you cant just check someone into rehab against their will.
You son of a bitch you killed her.,She's not dead.,"Wait, did she die or did you kill her?"
Get her out of that coma.,I don't think so. He starts to walk away.,If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
"Stop this. Alright, I! I don't consent anymore. I want to do the slow detox.",He stops and faces the father.,I changed my mind.
"I haven't slept in weeks, because my teeth hurt. Dentist couldn't find any cavities. And I'm getting these headaches.","Oh, poor you. He pulls out his pills.","Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go."
"I think I'm going crazy. And my stomach, I roll out of bed and I want to puke.",I take it you're married. He takes a pill.,I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
You must be psyParkc. He holds up his left hand with wedding ring clearly visible.,You must be witty. When's she due?,"Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?"
How'd you know she was--,Because I'm doing her.,Because she is!
It's all in my head?,"No, it's all in your hormones. Good news is no ones gonna lecture you if you smoke and get drunk.",Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
"Anterograde amnesia, short term memory loss, evidence of a hypoxic brain injury might be the result of getting cut off from the oxygen when she flat lined. PRobably the result of that rapid detox you told us to push on her. You gonna put that down? House puts down his 'Celeb' magazine and inhales, holds his breath. You gonna sulk? House shakes his head. I'm not gonna indulge you. House checks his watch. Treatment for hypoxic brain injuries consist of! House exhales.","Cameron, Chase and the dark one Foreman, right? Patient flat lined for like 30 seconds, got to be oxygen deprived for longer than that to lose brain function.","Well lets see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasnt had sex in six months, and she ate a fly."
We can't be sure how long she was--,Her brain's fine.,"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?"
Memory loss. You're saying that's not a neurological symptom?,No. I'm saying what I'm saying. Her brain's fine.,You really cant remember anything?
Her brain's fine. She's faking?,She's got post traumatic stress disorder.,Im sure shes just confused.
We got models fighting in Iraq now?,Show me a Woman on heroin who looks like that He hold up a magazine picture of Alex. and I'll show you a Woman who's been sexually abused.,"You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesnt have to be a model."
That's your proof? That she's good looking?,"He Manages her career, travels the world with her, at her side 24/7 he's either a very good dad or a very bad dad.",Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
"You saw that tuchas, would the fact that she's your daughter really stop you? Scoffing. Oh.",Her brain is running away from reality. When the drugs can't do it anymore it starts to shut down.,"Yknow what? III II have had enough of this! Yknow, III care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So ifif youve got a problem with me, frankly"
Your theory has the advantages of being completely unprovable and completely exculpating you.,"When you guys are done talking do an MRI and an LP when her brain checks out as normal then we'll know that daddy really, really loves her.","Yes, but if Im successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm."
Why would your mind go to abuse so fast?,I had a funny uncle.,Momentary lapse. Dontdont you have any selfcontrol?
I don't know if it has something to do with this case or if you have something personal going on. The whole break up thing--,It's personal.,"I dont know what youre getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory."
House. Your pain is affecting your decision making.,"You got a pRoblem with a call I make, question the call don't make it personal.","I dont know what you want me to tell you, man."
Are you saying pain can't affect your mood? If I'm right about the pain you're going to want to rush Everything which is what you're doing. Don't.,House looks like it may have made an impact. Thank you. Are you doing your daughter?,"Why not? Youll feel better! Ill feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes."
Are you doing your daughter? What?,"We should pRobably talk privately huh, come on, walk with me. Foreman shakes his head.","So hey, Im want to set you up with my daughter."
Foreman shakes his head. I'm not.,He's not. Sure he's not. She is a babe though.,"NO, NO Im not, Im not, I just."
I should take your head off. House checks the dad's glands.,"Your glands are fine. So now you're my Patient. You've got doctor-Patient confidentiality, no worries. So what did you do to her?","Hi, Ben. Im your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
How could you possibly think?,Hard to imagine anyone not wanting to nail her.,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
You son of a--,"It's a compliment. The heart shaped ass, those perfect perky all natural breasts.",What did you do when they found out?
That is my daughter you're talking about.,"No, that's your daughter you were talking about. House opens his magazine. 'She just instinctively knows how to walk. Designers just love that heart shaped ass, those perfect perky--'",I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved.
I'm her Manager I have to promote her.,"Oh, that makes sense.",Shes my champion.
All right. He starts to leave.,Do you love her?,"All right, were heading out."
I nEver touched her.,Do you love her?,I didnt touch her!
What are you doing? Trying to trap me into saying--,Do you love her enough to admit that you slept with her?,What is the matter with you?
One time. House throws the magazine in the trash and walks out.,PTSD. Get her a psych referral and pack her bags. He did her.,Not once? Not in any way?
Don't think so.,"Daddy thinks so. Could be mistaken, said he was drunk, could be some other daughter.",What were you doing in his closet?
We have to call Parkld protective services.,Doctor-Patient confidentiality.,"Ahhahh, wed better call the fire department!"

No! She's not ready.,You were ready this morning.,She is not ready.
She's not done. She's gotta save that guy.,Alternate theories?,"Well, shes done."
Amebiasis was our best hope. The fact that her heart rate went back to normal when we stopped the meds pretty much--,What's our second best hope?,"Ill go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is."
Maybe we should just biopsy it.,"She's a fridge with the power out. We start poking around inside, the vegetable goes bad.

That would be a little odd considering that's where all his symptoms are.,Says who?,"Okay, look, Im gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can."
Says who? The Patient.,"Since most Patients can't tell their ulna from their anus, I'm guessing this guy also doesn't know the difference between choking and suffocating.",Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
"It feels like I have to urinate, and then when I try to go!",Pull up your pants.,Im losing control of my bladder.

Means there's a neurological pRoblem.,"More significantly, it's yet another classic sign of heavy metals.",It means that my guys wont get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.

So it's not a typical case! We should get an ANA,It's not lupus! The symptoms don't match.,"Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?"

So would lupus nephritis! And it also causes tissue swelling.,"He's choking on his tongue, not his feet.","Well, not unless its got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now Im a dehydrating maniac!"

I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?

And don't be calling in sick or saying that your team needs you for some kind of emergency consult.,"He suspected that his wife had also been playing the pickle games, he'd just keep it on the down-low. Just wait 'till she got infected.",Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...

You think she's poisoning him?,"His symptoms should be getting better the longer he's here, instead they're getting worse.",She feeds him out of her own mouth?

I am not going to accuse a Woman of trying to murder her own husband simply based on some paranoid theory.,It's the only explanation. We've eliminated Every other possibility.,Lysas head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter.
We have not eliminated Every other possibility!,Has he responded to the latest lupus treatment?,Theres gotta be something else we could try.
He's only been on it for a few hours.,"He hasn't responded because it's not lupus! It's not allergies, ALS, arthritis or sarcoidosis. She's all that's left. Do it!",He hasnt gotten out of that chair in two days.

Mind if I take a look in your purse? Why?,Because I'm going to need to search it and you for whatEver you're using to poison your husband.,"Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um."
Why would I want to hurt my husband?,Then you won't mind if I search your things.,"Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?"
You satisfied? Absolutely not.,"She agreed to let me search Everywhere else, but this she says no to. Doesn't that tell you something?","Uhh, are you saying that youre not entirely happy about this?"
"Yes, that she doesn't want some lunatic doctor searParkng her vagina with a flashlight.",Cameron can do that.,What do you suppose she meant by that?
I am not going to,The Woman hasn't left the hospital since they arrived. WhatEver she's using she's obviously hiding somewhere.,How long should we stay?
She's not poisoning him!,It's the only explanation!,I cant believe this!
"No, it's the only explanation your twisted mind can come up with because you're angry that you can't find the answer and you're taking it out on her!",And you are protecting a complete stranger based on some Parkldishly roMantic notion that people are all so happily married they don't want to kill each other!,She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.

"We should start him on cyclophosphamide, see if it makes a difference.","Yeah, and interferon.",How is this lying?
"Interferon isn't an approved treatment for heavy metal toxicity, either.",True. But it's pretty much the only thing we can do for a viral infection. We didn't consider it because it doesn't,"Oh honey, Ill say goodbye to you at the car if you dont mind the puss."
Because it doesn't make sense! There's no fEver!,"Because he's got no immune system, thanks to the immunosuppressant you prescribed him for lupus treatment.","Well, maybe it isnt warm enough in here."
"He didn't present with a fEver, either.","Because at that point he was a post-viral autoimmune reaction, which again, thanks to the immunosuppressants you prescribed for lupus treatment, his immune system basically rolled out the red carpet for the dorMant virus, waking it up, turning it into a present viral infection.","Actually, we met online."
"But if it is lupus, interferon could make it worse.

What's so urgent?,"Two cases, same symptoms. What do 6-yr-olds and 70-yr-olds have in common?","Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D."
"Their immune systems don't work as well, could be Listeria.",I already checked for that.,You know what?
So does asthma.,No no no.,"Enhances it, really."
Could both be diabetes. she and Foreman pick up the case files on the table,No!,"Oh, perhaps its Amy coming to her senses."
This kid doesn't have kidney failure.,He will.,He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.
"Based on this file, the kid just ate some bad food. Was the old Man--",They were nowhere near each other in any of the four dimensions.,Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?
This case is 12 years old.,Yep.,"So essentially, this comes down to damages."
And this case is Cuddy's.,She assigned it to me.,"Macs Office, Mac is talking to C."
She agrees with you that this is something more than gastroenteritis?,"She wouldn't have assigned it to me if she didn't, would she?",I think Ill help her out.
"She wouldn't have assigned it to me if she didn't, would she?",What were we talking about?,"No, I think she was just trying to help."
Two Patients with two symptoms in common. And 5 symptoms not in common.,"While you were all wearing your 'Frankie says Relax' T-shirts, I was treating a 73-yr-old Woman who went through this progression of symptoms, the last of which was...",Then you leave me no choice.
"This is all because a Parkld has some blood in his diarrhea. He's got a tummy ache, if there was any reason to think it was anything worse, Cuddy would be all over it.",Great. Do a colonoscopy.,I dont think thats vomit.
On a 6-yr-old kid who pRobably has nothing worse than some food poisoning?,"If you happen to find any purple papules, do me a favour and grab a slice. I want to check for Erdheim-Chester.","I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?"
"A disease that there have been what, maybe 200 reported cases of, Ever?","If Esther's family had let me to an autopsy, there'd be 201.",Any chance you know what it is?
"Forget it Chase, your punParkng the shark story is good but she's not waiting for you. Foreman laughs",walks in So?,Hey I didnt kill your fish.
We couldn't confirm the source of the bleeding but we did biopsy some-- Blood blisters.,"You mean papules. Come on Cameron, who's right? she's looking into the microscope","Its okay, this is just something that happens."
Chase is. Negative for Erdheim-Chester.,Let me see. he checks If it's not Erdheim-Chester...,Adam Chase and Ira Ungerleider
"It's exactly what we said before, garden variety viral gastroenteritis, can we go back to the party?",taking off his bowtie Do a kidney biopsy. Esther's shut down in exactly-- he checks his watch,"Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home."
"This kid is not Esther. You screwed up, she died, I'm sorry but that does not mean this kid is dying as well.",Geez. You get testy when you don't get any fuzz. Come on.,"Hes not going to die, mother."
It was just some sort of virus? What's that?,Urine.,It must be a virus.
Ian's kidneys are shutting down.,Still think it's not the same case?,Andy... is having a
Still think it's not the same case?,"So, what can cause bloody diarrhea, ataxia and kidney failure?",That its the same thing.
I'll go and do a biopsy.,Forget it. That battle's over. His rising creatinine is his kidney's way of saying go on without me. What explains Everything?,"I cant, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."
"E. coli H0157 causes bloody diarrhea, and leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome. Toxins from the bacteria causes his kidneys to shut down, we should start him on plasmapheresis.","Clear, concise, and completely plausible. And exactly what I did last time, didn't work. What else?",Theyre gonna hear us.
Goodpasture's syndrome. Circulating antibodies cause kidney failure and bleeding.,But not the purple papules.,You are bleeding through your shirt.
"His hematocrit would have to be low, it's at 44 and Esther's nEver dropped below...",42,"In what space, sir, in what space?"
You have the file memorised?,It's my lucky number.,Its not gone!
You check Esther for that?,She nEver showed any signs of...,I see Esthers back in town.
I'll page Cuddy.,No you won't.,"Okay, Ill be up in, 18 pages."
She thinks the kid has a stomach ache.,"She'll come right up here and do one of two things - if she agrees with me, I don't need her, if she disagrees I don't want her.","You know, Michael, sometimes my daughters stomach hurts when theres a mean girl at school."
You can't handle people disagreeing with you? She might have a different take on this.,"Subordinates can disagree with me all they want, it's healthy. People who can shut me down on the other hand... forget Cuddy, I'll have Wilson keep her busy.","So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldnt bother you. And you dont have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even cant be civil to the woman I love..."
"Subordinates can disagree with me all they want, it's healthy. People who can shut me down on the other hand... forget Cuddy, I'll have Wilson keep her busy.",puts his phone on speakerphone Keep your answers short and discrete. Is Cuddy still playing?,"Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics."
The Parkcken is still in Picadilly Square.,Brilliant. She'll nEver suspect that NorMandy is her target.,I know theyre still there.
Is that House? Tell him that the blinds just went to 20-40 and he's running out of Parkps.,How's she doing?,"Hooh, hes gonna get some!"
"Well what's going on? The way you took off, something's obviously--",Love to chat but got a game to play. How's she doing?,Dude! How come you took off?
Are you talking about me?,And what have you got?,How is that me?
Hmm... does sound like high dose cardio meds.,"while on the phone, performs a trick to make a Parkp disappear, what a magician he is Two hearts. You got the flush?","Hi fellas. Oh, wheres your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?"
Still waiting on the final labs.,She drinking her seltzer?,The new laboratory.
"No, hydration is not a pRoblem.",Means she's bluffing. Push her all in. Wilson does so,"Yes. Also, dont forget to close the toilet or shell drink out of it."
flips his cards but only ends up having one pair SEven of clubs. Cuddy cackles,"Oh dear, sounds like I messed up. You're going to be stuck with her for a while. Talk to you soon. puts down the phone","Chandler and Joeys, Chandler is playing living room golf as Rachel enters."
The base of his brain's been infiltrated by a small mass. We think--,Pituitary?,Arent you slicing that mans brain a little too thin?
Explains the low blood pressure.,"walks to the board and starts writing, Chase enters Pretty much confirms the lymphoma. Should have started Esther on prednisone.","Ooh, Julies so smart, Julies so special."
"Didn't see any in the blood either. White blood cells show no spindling, or abnormal nuclei, nothing on immuno-chemistries either. It's not lymphoma.","hopes shot down again, he takes his cane and wanders out of the room with the Ducklings in tow",Right. Right. Ross. So whats the deal with you guys? I dont want to get in the middle of anything
"hopes shot down again, he takes his cane and wanders out of the room with the Ducklings in tow House!",It's a train. We don't know what kind of train--,What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Woah grabs House's cane,I'm thirsty.,He musta been sweepin.
I'm thirsty. It's closed!,yanks his cane back and starts whacking the lock again until it does open and the gate rolls up out of the way It's not now.,"Excuse me, Im thirsty, so Im going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage."
The fact that the end of the line is death... is an advantage?,The fact that we know is an advantage.,I will not have you dying on my behalf.
I'll do an ultrasound.,"No, treatment will tell us more faster.",Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
How can we start treatment if we have no idea what we're treating for?,angrily knocks back some stuff on the counter with a crash Treat him for Everything!,Do you know how to do an intervention?
What's going on?,Oh just catParkng up on some TV. How're you doing?,"The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
She says the Patient--,I heard. What've you got?,Its the woman from the hospital admissions office.
Well Cuddy just raised and err...,You're paired.,No no no its ok.
You're paired. What?,Nines?,"Oh, thats an excellent question."
"momentary shock, he looks around to check whether House is standing behind him or something How do you know?","Anything lower, you wouldn't sound so excited.","Okay, he sees us."
"Wait, wha... what's going on? If you're going to mess with me, wouldn't it be more fun to do it in person?","Yes, it would.","I hope not, because you dont want to mess with me."
to Cuddy Erm... can you beat a pair of threes?,What did she do?,You mean a three pointer?
"I left orders for PO fluids, doctor.","Enough with the codes, she obviously knows it's me.",I just wanted to check and see if theres anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave.
She's drinking her seltzer. Cuddy looks surprised and stops,Did she stop?,"Penny, can we please get our drinks?"
Did she stop? Yes.,Go all in.,Did you stop Rachel?
Go all in. Umm... but...,Just do it.,Put all my money in me.
"You couldn't care less about this charity Event, you claim not to be messing with me, obviously you're either trying to keep me--","Shut up! Look, last time I wanted the game to go on. I still do. Means that this time you get to win.",You really think I didnt say goodbye to you because I dont care?
Meds seem to be working. Liver's holding its own.,Good.,How are you doing?
But the platelets are dropping.,Even better.,"Cells are overflowing, my lord."
Why? It means he's getting sicker.,It's new. New is good. Because old ended in death.,"You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility."
We had to put him on a ventilator.,He's back on Esther's path.,Youre kidding. Did you Heimlich him?
Acetylcysteine could mess with the lungs.,"Mess with them, not shut them down in 20 minutes.",Remarkable. Arent you worried about secondhand smoke?
Slows down all five hundred of them? Foreman concedes her point,Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?,How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?,What effects would interferon have on leukemia?,"Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring."
"Depends on what type. Could make it better, could make it worse.",Four-year fellowship to learn that.,"No, its not."
Tell House if he wants to play cards he can get his ass back down here and play.,"You hear that? She wants me off the phone, means she's vulnerable. Go all in.",Bring him back to his chambers now.
It's over in less than 2 hours. Which means you either have 3 of a kind or just 3's. I'm guessing 3's. I bet five hundred.,Go all in.,Times almost up.
You obviously want to bust me . Why would you--,Either you go all in or I tell Everybody in the building that you wear toenail polish.,"Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that."
"fakes a rather anguished face before turning over one card, and then the other rather enthusiastically Oh, oh, oh no, oh no! Ohhhh that's gotta hurt. The glee on Cuddy's face turns to horror",What happened?,"Oh, well, when you dont have the cards, you dont have the cards, you know."
I just killed two birds with one straight. Goodbye.,"Fine, keep playing, but I need you to recommend a good Oncologist because if I don't get one up here in the next few minutes, I got a dead 6-yr-old.",Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
"If you need help, ask. These games are insane.",Games have a higher success rate.,"You know, I think this is a good stopping point."
"Well, I don't see anything that looks like leukemia. You do a bone marrow biopsy?",No time.,"Oh, man, never thought Id say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow."
"Even if there is an occult blood cancer, you wouldn't expect interferon to make it worse. And certainly not this fast.",What would move this fast?,"Well yknow, things are different."
"Who may or may not have had Kawasaki's. This kid on the other hand, he makes antibodies that are eating the inside of his arteries, choking off blood to his major organs one by one. First the GI tract, then the kidneys, then the brain, now the lungs.",Can anyone think of a reason why Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly? Other than it doesn't. no reply Nice.,"Oh, gee, its a little late for coffee, isnt it?"
What was the old lady's sed rate?,Elevated. 98.,She was about to turn 97.
You can't use another Patient's labs to diagnose Kawasaki's disease!,Is that like a dare or something?,A microvalentine for a microbiologist.
You don't have time to be wrong.,"Fine. We'll look for Kawasaki where he lives, Ian's coronary arteries.",You have no right to an opinion.
Have you read Moby Dick?,It was a book?,"Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?"
It was 10 years ago.,12,"Oh, ten, twelve months ago."
Obsession is dangerous.,Only if you're on a wooden ship and your obsession is a whale. I think I'm in the clear.,"Sure. By the way, theres a difference between being obsessive and. . ."
You do realise it's a metaphor?,You do realise that the point of metaphors is to scare people from doing things by telling them that something much scarier is going to happen than what will really happen?,"Look, I know its a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, itll pay for itself."
Esther didn't have a mass in her heart.,Ian's younger. He can take more of a pounding. Esther died before the disease reached her heart. The disease made a mass and made it fast.,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Or muscle. Connective tissue?,"Kid can't take any more theories. Only thing we know is that whatEver that mass is, that's what he's got. We need a piece of it. I'm doing a biopsy.",I told you not to get the surgery.
I'll shut the blinds.,"No let them watch, I do my best work on the big stage. Passing through the superior vena cava.","Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes."
You're in the atrium. Pull back. You've hit the wall of the heart.,"These procedures would be so much simpler if you could do them on healthy people. And out again. as he's pulling the biopsy needle out, alarms start beeping V fib!","Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow well find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and Im not feeling all that well."
Cardiac arrest! Call a code.,"takes off Ian's Robe Come on, paddles! Come on.",A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!
Come on. Charged.,"Clear! he shocks Ian, no effect","Charges! Come on, come on!"
"Code blue, Iso room. Code blue, Iso room. nurses run to the alert","And again. shocks Ian, Chase checks for a pulse","Code 4, I need a gurney, right away, right away."
"shocks Ian, Chase checks for a pulse Nothing.","Again. shock, check for pulse","Yeah, okay. You didnt maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didnt arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him."
"Again. shock, check for pulse",You got a clock on this?,"Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects."
How much longer are you going to keep doing this?,"Clear. shock, check for pulse","Okay, how long is this going to go on."
Wait! I've got something.,He's back. he starts to finish taking out the biopsy needle which is still stuck where it was before Ian went into cardiac arrest,What about a gift basket full of cash?
What are you doing?,Doing what we came here to do.,That was weird.
It almost killed him.,"I know, I was right here. Give me a vacutainer.","Yeah, well, it almost killed me."
"His brain's been oxygen-deprived for over 8 minutes. There might be nothing left, he might--",Tell the parents. Where the hell is that vacutainer? a nurse hands him one,Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Tell the parents. Where the hell is that vacutainer? a nurse hands him one,"So, what's he got?",Its not my job to take sides or pass judgment.
"So, what's he got? Brain damage.",Good chance. I was talking about before that.,The man is showing brain.
You're not worried about--,"Things I can't do anything about, I try not to.",I do not look worried.
Very unlikely in a 73-yr-old.,"WhatEver this is is very unlikely. Come on, more ideas, let's go people.","No, that doesnt seem any more likely."
"If it's genetic he's had it all his life, why now?","I don't know, it sure fits nice enough.",Theres something you didnt know about your dad!
Multiple neurofibromatosis. Chondrocytomas.,How's it going? You win?,Im right here!
"I got called away. By the angry parents of a Patient. There are THREE of you here, none of you had the sense to stop him, to pick up a phone and call me.","I told them you'd signed off. The parents are mad because their kid is dying, that's understandable. But if he doesn't die, they won't be mad anymore.",Yeah. This man is not my father. Im being held hostage. So Im going to do something insane in the hopes that youll call 911.
"Well if he's brain-damaged, they might still be a little ticked.",I had to do it to save him.,Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
"You had to do it to diagnose Esther. You may have killed a 6-yr-old because you're obsessed with a Woman who's been dead for 12 years. Sometimes you lose, House. You're not God!",He's not dead yet.,"Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didnt do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow and all his little sparrows all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
"No, but you're done with him, it's my case now. Go home, go ride your motorcycle, go brood in a dark room, just don't go near Ian again. she storms off","So, anything else or is it just these sEven?",Of course you do!
"Drop it House, she's right.",No she's not. You know she's not.,"She said no, can we drop it now?"
We should have called her.,I'm surprised you didn't.,"Well, we should call her."
You're going to have to find a way to let this go. We can't go near Ian.,"We don't need to go near him, we have his tumor.","Its okay, Im just being emotional about this."
Maybe two good pieces.,How Many okay pieces?,Yeah. But one would be good.
Three would be pushing it.,"turns around to look back at the whiteboard Three tests, sEven choices. Okay, what's first?","Oh my God, I was thinking four."
Sarcoidosis seems most likely.,"Yeah, so likely that Cuddy's going to think of that all on her own. She's got the kid's whole body to play with. Let her do that test. What's next?",Not with your hands.
"Or it's his immune system, histiocytosis.","Well there are more documented cases of histio amongst older people than tuberous sclerosis, let's start with that. he circles it on the board, Ducklings exit","Well, hes not used to women being so forward with him but uh, I good check with himHe says its okay."
Time course fits.,"Mr Foreman, you agree with both of them? Thanks for playing.",Im very busy with timesensitive work.
"If we have enough tissue for two tests, why not do both?",Then we don't have to think as hard. Taking the pressure off the choice makes us less likely to think critically.,"They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?"
Sarcoma is more likely to hit a 6 and 70 yr old.,Tuberous sclerosis it is.,More often they die young.
You think sarcoma's less likely?,"It's more likely, the test for it on the other hand, is less reliable.",The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.
KR67's negative. And PCH antigen is negative.,Mighty Casey is down to his last strike.,You mustnt call me that in front of anyone else.
Mighty Casey struck out.,"Thanks a lot, didn't read that this weekend. pops a vicodin",Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
I vote for neurofibromatosis.,Why?,Hard day huh?
Because the other choices suck worse.,Give me a minute.,Theres stronger choices.
Give me a minute.,You want me out of here?,Just give us a minute.
You come up with anything?,No.,That give you some ideas?
No. Hey.,We can talk about it tomorrow.,"Hey. Oh, no."
"he starts walking back to his office, then turns around again to address House I erm... I won the poker tournament. House is immediately interested I totally played this guy BurMan from Business Affairs. I got great cards, but I don't bet. Just call, no raises. BurMan pairs his king on the flop, I keep calling, the river turns, I check. He can't stand it. He goes all in, he's sure he's won. Wilson dramatically makes hand gestures about flipping the cards I call. I flip 'em. Oh! he looks victorious",Pocket aces.,"Oh, it was a good one."
I nailed his ass!,"smiles indulgently, then suddenly realises something The aces were hiding all along.",I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
"smiles indulgently, then suddenly realises something The aces were hiding all along.",Test him for Erdheim-Chester disease.,Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well Ive got one. Manboy! The Ace of Babes.
So did Esther.,Disease lied.,But they loved her.
"Yeah, the tumor's got it in for you. Diseases don't lie.","Fine, it didn't lie, it slow played us. We biopsied the colon, it hadn't reached the GI tract yet. It's there now. It's in his liver, his lungs--","I didnt say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy."
We can't waste our one test on the one disease we know it's not.,Run the test. The ducklings look disappointed but do it anyway,Well then I think thats it.
You sure about this?,"Wait, let me think about that. Don't pressure me. Just run the damn test.",Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
Cells look like macrophages.,That's a good start.,"Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator."
That's a good start.,walks away and stares at the wall Take your time and say it loud.,Fine. How do you want to start?
CD 68 positive he smiles,Start the treatment. Ducklings exit,I know Mr.
So Esther can rest peaceful now huh?,Yeah.,To live out her days with the widows of dead Khals.
peeks at his cards Forty. they are betting with real money this time You got lucky. You going to call?,"What I do, is not just based on the flip of a card.","Come on Rach, when a guy says hes going to call, it doesnt mean hes going to call."
You guessed. You got lucky.,It fit.,I won! That was my guess!
It could just as easily have been sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.,"No, not just as easily.",Im going to get some fries.
Maybe not. But it wasn't impossible. Are you going to call?,"the piano music starts up again in the background, House smokes his cigar You know, relative to it's size, the barnacle has the largest penis of any animal.",Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so Im not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.
"stands in the doorway for a brief moment, then loudly shuts the door.","jumps, startled from sleep, takes the Medical Journal off his face.","We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?"
You've seen one Patient in the last two hours.,CompliCated case. I'm a night owl - Wilson's an early bird. We're different species.,"Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?"
Move him into his own cage.,"Who'll clean the droppings from mine? Rolls over, turning his back to her",Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
"walks to the other side of the examination bed, hands him the file Twenty-five year old female with sleep issues.",I'm guessing she's...,"Mattress King, Monica is trying to return her bed."
She's a little bit more than upset. She hasn't slept in ten days.,"She's lying. Without REM sleep, your neurons stop regenerating - the brains shut down lobe by lobe. She'd be insane after five days - dead by ten.","Shes just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning."
"Give me a little credit, I know what gets you off. She took the pills to sleep, not to kill herself.",ClEver alibi.,She was an odd fish.
"They didn't work. She stayed awake, Even though she downed the whole bottle.","seems intrigued, takes the file from Cuddy",Did they work?
And the longest anyone has Ever survived without sleep is elEven days. Which gives you about 22 hours. exits,sits up properly and reads the file,I dont think theres a whole lot of sleeping going on.
"You knew I was writing one, you gave me notes!","Got a case. It can wait, you two finish. To Chase Five bucks says someone loses an eye.","Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this."
snatches the file from House and begins reading through it,"Fine. You're only putting off the inevitable. Twenty five year old female, hasn't slept for ten days.","Rachels outer office, Tag has finished searching his desk and Rachel comes out to try to plant the folder on the desk."
"interrupts him The brain is being stressed, we need to reliEve that. To House You've had my article on your desk for the last four months!","I'm a very slow reader. No fEver, no white count, means no infection.","Oh, no, no, no, I dont have time for this."
"No fEver, no white count, means no infection. SParkzophrenia?",No delusions.,"Well, the first time didnt really count."
You read his!,"I signed it, I didn't read it. pauses Aside from the sleeping pills, tox-screen was clean. No cocaine, meth, amphetamines, or diet pills.","Really? That, thats it? Thats comforting?"
Nothing that would cause sleep disturbances. When did you get his article?,Ahh.. about three weeks ago. Let's go back to the beginning.,"Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?"
How far back?,"Genesis. God said, let there be light.",Not that far back!
And if her brain can't interpret those cues.. Optic-nerve disease.,I'm sensing another article.,"Shes probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up."
No I didn't.,takes some vicodin out the pill bottle he had in his pocket and places it inside of a folded napkin,"No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes."
Negative for optic nerve disease.,But she sleeps.,"No, its a nitrogen laser."
"For like 10 seconds. Maximum, one minute. We also checked the ocular pressure. It's normal.",begins loudly crushing the vicodin folded inside of the napkin with the back handle of his cane And she doesn't know she sleeps.,"Um, yeah. Youre computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, its also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour."
"The brain is often unaware of stage one sleep. CT showed no tumors, no clots, no seizure disorders.","unfolds the napkin and sprinkles the crushed vicodin over his food So.. she sleeps, she just can't stay asleep.","If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone."

"laughs There's no monster in the closet, we looked.","Well, it's certainly not showing up on the scans. pauses Where's Cameron?",Did you look in my closet?
She felt I could deliver the news on my own.,"Oh, this is going to work out great.","I was going to tell her, just on my own time."

"But pRobably Even with the few minutes of sleep she does have, its torture.",So is cutting people with knives. But you can totally get away with that if you have a doctor coat on.,"Oh, I dont know, shes pretty tired, too, I think weve got her onboard."
"House, those few seconds of sleep are maybe the only reason she's still alive.","The more symptoms we can force out of her, the more tests we can do, the more tests we do, the more information we get, the quicker we make a diagnosis.","Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her and thats why youre the best roommate ever."

"Her partner is donating blood, so she's with the nurse.",PRobably singing her lullabies. pops open his vicodin bottle I want her awake.,"Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out."
You have to sedate a Patient to do a colonoscopy.,Why?,This isnt going to work if youre guessing.
That much blood is not a 'just a' anything.,When two people fight this much - you know what it means.,Blood alone moves the wheels of history!
"The question isn't what, it's why.","Oh, get a room.",That is that is a loaded question.
"Do you have a specific type of neurogenic toxin in mind, or should we just start running a thousand different tox-screens?",Just pretend I'm not here. I'll be reading.,I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.
"Or it could be us, do you have any idea what it feels like to have a six-foot long hose shoved into your large intestine?",No. But I now have a much greater respect for whichEver basketball player you dated in college.,And that became they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps.
Wouldn't keep her awake for ten days.,What if the poison ivy wasn't poison ivy.,"Shh, I just got her to sleep."
The poison ivy treatment was steroids.,"Much lower dosage. Get her back on the juice, triple the dose. Get a cianga, and an upper airway biopsy to confirm the wegener's.",Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
"She has a... menstrual pRoblems. They're really bad, the pain keeps her in bed all day, plus, she's super depressed.",pulls up a chair with his cane She said 'super depressed'?,"Yknow, just be there for her."
She heard that birth control pills can make her feel better.,sighs She wants birth control pills for her PMS.,"Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me hes in the placebo group."
sighs She wants birth control pills for her PMS. I guess.,"Judging by the redness around your mom's nostrils and the tissue she's got conveniently stashed in her wristband, I'd say her pRoblem is more likely a URI than a PMS.","Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy."
"Judging by the redness around your mom's nostrils and the tissue she's got conveniently stashed in her wristband, I'd say her pRoblem is more likely a URI than a PMS. URI?",Upper respiratory infection. A cold.,"No, no, PMS is different."
I don't think so...,I also think she's got a pRoblem with SAC.,I dont think so.
I also think she's got a pRoblem with SAC. SAC?,winks at her Thanks for playing.,Its her I have to worry about.
"If you want the pill, all you have to do is walk into any health clinic in Jersey alone and ask for it. sighs",What exactly was your plan?,"Look, I told ya, Im not going to any clinic!"
clicks his pen and begins writing a prescription You were going to exchange the birth control pills for some over the counter decongestants in the hopes that your mom's cold lasts another six years? No.,pulls off the prescription paper and hands it over,What if he reads it in the paper?
That for a cold?,"No. That's for your ovaries. I assume you haven't had a stroke, have you Ever had a blood clot?","Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath."
"I assume you haven't had a stroke, have you Ever had a blood clot? No.",Super.,"Well no, Im just in a coma."
Is this just one of your experiments? You just wanted to see how I'd react to being screwed over by Foreman?,"shuts the exam room door Nice idea, but no.","Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine."
"Right. We're both victims. A simple heads up, that's all I needed. You know, between your incredibly witty remarks about anal sex and Cuddy's breasts, you could have tipped me off.","Then I'd have Foreman pissed at me. And as annoying as you can be, at least I know you're not going to pop a cap in my ass. Witty, huh?","See, Im finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law Order and that you flirted with every guy in the TriState area!"
"sighs, starts to walk away","You on the other hand, continue to be flabbergasted Every time someone actually acts like a huMan being.","Okay, Im just gonna walk away, cause I dont want to be here."
comes out of her daze Yeah of course.,Was she sitting up or lying down?,"So, what happens to her?"
Was she sitting up or lying down? Sitting up.,Then it wasn't REM.,"Okay, heres my question, why did you sit down?"
But Chase says her eyes are moving the exact way.,Did you start her on the steroids?,"Nobody move! Okay, you look that way Ill look this way!"
"Not yet, we were still doing the---",Then she wasn't sleeping.,"No, were kind of taking it slow."
How do you know?,Because we haven't done anything yet.,Isis he ok?
Keeping her awake.,Good.,Getting her pregnant.
She could have been exposed to an open wound.,Did she have a dog?,"Uh, probably. Its hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth."
"Animal allergies seems unlikely, but its possible that---",When?,No youre not.
"Animal allergies seems unlikely, but its possible that--- When?",When did she get rid of the dog?,"I know what youre thinking, Ive taken your asthma into account."
About a month ago. Her girlfriend gave it to her for her birthday.,Well then it's not allergies. She's just leaving her girlfriend.,When was the last time you saw her wear it?
You... spoke to the dog?,"If her birthday was a month ago, she would still be on steroids for the poison ivy.","Hey, buddy. Hows my favorite dog, huh? Hows my favorite dog? Youre subdued. Did you give him a beer?"
We should still do a scratch test. If she's allergic to one thing--,She is not allergic.,I think one of her cats did once.
"Okay. Well, we could either base the diagnosis on your admittedly keen understanding of lesbian relationships, or, we could do a scratch test.",Do a scratch test.,"Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend."
Why not? Considering her current mental state.,What about her mental state?,"No, no. Shes way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy."
sighs You... were right about her wanting to break up.,"It just means I was right, doesn't mean she's suicidal.","Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
A bottle of pills is what landed her here in the first place.,"Sleeping pills. God knows why she'd want them. What else can cause sleep disorder, and internal bleeding?","Yeah, eventually. Shes still not happy about taking a bottle, though."
"Drugs or alcohol can mess with the sleeping, and compromise the liver.",What are you doing here? Who's keeping her awake?,Okay the sleeping thing.
"Doesn't matter. Liver function tests are through the sky. The liver's not compromised, it's dead. She doesn't need a diagnosis, she needs a new liver.",She's not getting a new liver unless we can figure out what's wrong with her.,"Okay, Im gonna have to stop you right there."
"Test for cirrhosis, twelve hours. Test for hepatitis, eight, she's not going to last another six.",So your advice is we just give up?,"Uh, were not sure."
"My advice is that we narrow our focus to conditions that we can diagnose, treat and cure in less than six hours. And there's nothing on that list.","The girlfriend donated blood, right?","Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz?"
"The girlfriend donated blood, right? Yeah. So?",That means they're the same type.,You met a woman when you were giving blood?
You can't ask the person she's about to dump to donate half her liver!,"Does seem tacky, doesn't it.","Eh, yknow what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
"Does seem tacky, doesn't it.",I'm Doctor House. I'm in charge of your case.,"No, isnt that kind of tacky?"
What's going on? How come no one is keeping her awake any more?,You're in acute liver failure.,"Oh, shes asleep."
That's it? You're giving up? You're... not going to try to figure out what's doing this to her?,"Well Even with the right diagnosis, any treatment is going to take longer than the time she has left.","Well, if you like her so much, dont give up."
"If it's her liver, can't she get a transplant?",Wouldn't work without a diagnosis. WhatEver killed the first liver will do the same to the second.,"Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?"
"But it... but it would give you more time to make the diagnosis, to get her better.","Well, it may give us an extra day or two, but, no procurement agency is going to let a liver go to a Patient with an undiagnosed pre-existing---","Understood, but it is what we need to capture what youre saying as clearly as possible."
Hannah and I have the same blood type. Couldn't I be the donor?,It is medically possible for us to take a part of your---,"Yeah, but Im the only one related by blood."
"Please, I don't care about the risks!",To Hannah You're very lucky to have such a devoted partner.,I dont need a treadmill.
To Hannah You're very lucky to have such a devoted partner.,"I just bought us 36 hours. Differential diagnosis - which monster eats your liver, screws up your sleep, and causes bleeding?","Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you."
Does Max know Hannah plans to leave her?,"Didn't come up, so I guess, no.",Hmmm... shes been talking to Michael a lot.
"If she knew, there's no way she'd go through with this.","And if you didn't have a pathological need to create a close personal relationship with Every dying person you meet, we would be blissfully ignorant of any ethical dilemmas and","No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didnt know, how should I know?"
We have an ethical dilemma.,No we don't. Continue.,What was the dilemma?
"What about splenic cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma? She's the right age.",It could explain the bleeding. Maybe the liver failure.,"No. Im not a lawyer, but I dont think this is the place to do this."
We're withholding information relevant to her decision to risk her life. How is that not an ethical dilemma?,It's not medical information.,"Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical."
It's not medical information. Who cares?,The AMA.,What do you care?
No Kayser-Fleischer rings in her eyes.,The rings don't have to be there if there's neurological symptoms.,Really? Ive never seen her wear an engagement ring.
This is immoral.,"Look, let's say you're right. We tell, she changes her mind, our Patient dies. How is that moral? pauses What else?","As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery."
"She's not shrooming, she's a sports nut.",Right. Skiers nEver party.,I dont care what shes doing.
"She's doing this out of love, and Max doesn't know---","It's only moral to save a person if they love you? That's kind of a selfish way of looking at life. I like Wilson's disease, like cancer, love mushrooms.",I dont get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
"Yeah, but we don't have the time to test for any of these. Before she can get the transplant, we need to do about 80 procedures.","So do those tests, and my tests at the same time.","Yeah? Yeah, where is it?"
We have to.,We have to not. Because she's not our Patient.,Thats what we gotta do.
"She's getting surgery, she's someone's Patient.",Need a little help.,Hey is Rachel here?
Inexplicable rash on a Patient's scrotum you need me to look at?,27 year old female wants to donate half her liver to her dying girlfriend.,And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
That's very generous. This the sleepless girl? What's she got?,Liver failure.,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldnt tell me about?
You don't have a diagnosis.,The transplant buys me time.,I see. Have you considered therapy?
Let's just skip the part where I say this is insane.,It was her idea.,It is totally insane.
"If she wants to be an idiot, it's her call. You don't need me. Have one of your team walk her through the process.","The donor and the donee sort of have opposing interests, right? Can't really advise them both.","Listen, Sheldon, Im really happy to do this for you, but not if shes gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time."
You're concerned about the ethics of this? What's going on? What do you know?,Nothing medically relevant.,What exactly do you think goes on here?
But you know something. And it is relevant.,"If I can't tell her, I can't really tell you, can I? And if you're advising her.","I know, but its still worth mentioning, I think."
I assume this information is in the medical file.,My Patient's confidential file.,"Yeah, its here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio."
This hospital's file.,"You can either satisfy your curiousity, or remain ignorant, do nothing ethically wrong and my Patient doesn't die in three hours.","Yeah! Okayooh, but are you going to have time to read it?"
I take it you've seen that?,"Seen it, digested it, watched it blow up my entire department.",Yes! Have you seen it?
You read Cameron's version?,I didn't read either.,Does anyone have one from a different paper?
It was good.,Better than Foreman's?,oh it was great.
Maybe. He was more analytical about the diagnostic procedures. She concentrated more on the ethical dilemmas of informed consent. How any Patient can really be informed without a medical degree.,The same old party lines.,Was she helping him with his research?
Foreman should have told her.,"Ah, shoulda, woulda, coulda.","Oh, God, do you think she heard?"
"If you allow this sort of thing in your department, you're basically saying it's OK.","No, I'm saying that I don't care what they do as long as my life isn't interrupted by pointless conversations like this one.",Im saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I dont think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
"They won't trust each other, and they won't trust you.",They shouldn't.,Theyll never trust me.
Deception like this is just one step removed from actively sabotaging one another. Then what would you do?,"I could be the kindest gentlest boss in the world, and Foreman still would have done what he did because that's who he is.",I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
Right. Because you're all about the teaParkng.,Our Parkldren are the future.,I didnt make tea for you.
Hey! Cuddy cleared Max for surgery. She's OK to go.,How's our Patient?,I hope shes alright.
She's also cleared.,"I don't care about the prep, what about the diagnostic tests?",And shes back in the game.
"Blood proteins are normal, it's not---",Where's Cameron?,Your body only has a certain amount.
Taking a sample of the bile duct.,Surgery is supposed to start in about 15 minutes.,You want to work at the urinalysis lab?
She had a chance to get one last---,Hannah and Max will be in the same room.,That was only one of them.
You wanted us to do as much as we can before---,Both awake. With Cameron.,You made ourselves to be more than we were.
I don't know how to say this...,Good lord.,"So, Im not exactly sure how to say this."
You can tell me anything.,She hasn't slept in elEven days. Are you trying to torture her?,I tell ya a lot things!
She hasn't slept in elEven days. Are you trying to torture her?,"Ding ding, let's go.",Shh. Shes asleep.
"Ding ding, let's go.",I told you---,"Fine, lets go."
I didn't say a word to Max.,This is exactly why you got screwed with Foreman. You're looking for people to do the right thing.,I didnt do anything any of you wouldnt have done.
"She hasn't slept, her judgment's compromised due to inactivity in her pre-frontal cortex.","Oh, she could have the best pre-frontal cortex in the history of Mankind, but given the choice of life versus death, those bad bad people are going to choose life.",You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels.
"Then why did you sedate her? If she wasn't going to tell, if she was nEver going to do the right thing, why bother knocking her out? pause This isn't about them, if she talks, if she does the decent thing, then you don't get to solve your puzzle, your game's over, you lose.",Yeah. I want to save her. I'm morally bankrupt.,Ive got a plan.
"Ah, it doesn't have to be a motive. But it sure tastes good.","Oh! I am so reliEved you two are here. Without you looking at me, they're playing foosball down there.",Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
Max's heart stopped.,Your Patient is on the other side. Now get yourself upstairs and figure out what Hannah has or Max has risked her life for nothing.,"Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it."
Max's cardiac arrest was caused by hypoxia from hypoventilation. They restarted her heart and the right lobe of her liver was successfully transplanted into Hannah.,"Now, where were we before we were so rudely interrupted by the liver transplant?","Hang on. Hang on. Uhhuh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. Hes in critical condition."
"Gastric content was negative for spores, so no mushroom toxicity.",And the initial tests were negative for cancer.,Im allergic to mushrooms.
Which cancer were you looking for?,Any of them.,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
"Not going to tell you much. Her blood was thick after she was given immuno-suppressants. They fight rejection, they also mess up our ability to get any clear readings.",Great battles kick up a lot of dirt. Obscure the battlefields so the generals can't see what's going on.,"Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits."
"So what are your orders, General House?",Sound the retreat.,"Captain, what are your orders?"
silently nods his head.,Opens the door and moves inside.,You say thank you.
"She's been taking the decongestants, but she's not getting better, She.. also says...",What?,"Oh, shes sorry!"
Her boobs are bigger.,Promptly yanks his hand away.,"Yes. She has bigger breasts, too."
Slowly responds to her.,"No, you gave her the wrong pills.",She says its nice to meet you.
You speak Mandarin?,"I can count to ten and ask to go to the bathroom and Gongxi, ni kuai dang zumu le. Congratulations, you're going to be a grandmother.","Hi fellas. Oh, wheres your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?"
"Look at you, you're lying, your face is already reddening!","Okay, I'm going to leave you two alone now. I'm sure you've got a lot to talk about.","Boy, you really cant stand to lose, can you?"
"FEver is 106, she's in full rejection mode.",Is that supposed to surprise me?,Shes in heat.
Her white count is normal.,Normal is not normal.,Shes paler than milk.
We should start broad spectrum antibiotics.,"Yeah, you might want to add some Parkcken soup.","Yeah, it sounds fun."
"There is no ulcerations on the skin. sighs The bleeding, it looks more like leptospirosis.",Without conjunctivitis and elevated creatinine?,You need an operation.
Makes sense if we were in the Sudan.,You sure she hasn't been out of the country?,"Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. Its a lesson in context."
"You don't know? Come on, if you don't stay up to date on my notes, where's your next article going to come from?",You talked to the dog?,"Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!"
We're not as up on foreign languages as you are.,scoffs Has the dog been traveling?,You speak 19 languages.
It came from a breeder.,Where?,From my family.
"I don't know. A place called Blue Barrel Kennels. They only had the thing for like, two days.",Blue barrel is a kind of cactus. Do you see Many cacti in Jersey?,I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
Blue barrel is a kind of cactus. Do you see Many cacti in Jersey?,Wanna see a magic trick?,"No, just a barrel."
That wasn't there this morning.,"Give that to the lab, and call the CDC.",That was there when I got here.
And tell them what?,That we have a Patient with the plague.,"Hey, let me tell them!"
The... black plague?,nods Looks that way.,The fires of Mount Doom?
"The plague is carried by rodents, not dogs.","Where there's dogs, there's fleas.",And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
We better find out where that dog is now.,"After you restart the immuno-suppressants, then fill her up to the eyeballs with streptomycin, sulfate gentAmycin, and tetracycline.","Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back."
I've got the plague?,"Don't worry, it's treatable. Being a bitch though, nothing we can do about that.",My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
Walking up to him. Did you remember my DVD player?,"Well if you wanted it, you shouldn't have left it behind when you moved out.",In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
"No I get it, it's a drag watParkng porn on VHS.",I'll call you as soon as I'm done with it. That's if you Ever get a phone installed.,No. I get it. I get it. Youre not ready. Well wait. This is a classic...
"Ohh forget it, I'll come by and get it myself, err after work, Thursday?",Won't be home Thursday.,Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. Thank you.
"No pRoblem, still have a key I can let myself in and out.",I guess maybe I could bring in it tomorrow.,No problem. Im really sorry about your car.
It's a math contest.,What is it about girls who can count?,Something to do with numbers?
It's poker night isn't it? House's guilty look confirms it as the lift dings the fact that it has arrived on the ground floor. You said weeks ago that I could play. Stop making excuses.,"Gotta go, building full of sick people. He walks into the elevator and peeps out. If I hurry maybe I can avoid them.","OK, great. Youll tell us and well laugh. Lets play poker."
"Thank you, I appreciate it.",God talks to him?,"I appreciate that, thank you."
"It's not psychosis, he's just religious. The only medical issue that showed up on the blood work is low sodium.","No, you talk to God you're religious, God talks to you you're psychotic.","Well, I thought he made that up."
A lot of people experience their religion as something more than symbolic. That doesn't mean--,God Ever talked to you when you were in the seminary?,"Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods."
God Ever talked to you when you were in the seminary? Scoffs. No.,"God's loss, our gain. He's either psychotic or a scam artist.",You were right all along.
He was actually err... really impressive.,"Well yeah, with the burning bush and all, it's quite the show.",Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
"And he told Cameron, God wants her to stop being pissed at me over the article.",God knows you stole Cameron's article?,God. Hes crazy! Why doesnt he want to be with Rachel?
I'm over it.,Yeah.,"Ross, I thought you were over this."
No pigmentation and potassium lEvels are normal.,Cirrhosis?,Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
"Liver feels fine, transaminases are normal.",He sighs.,What were you doing in his closet?
You're going to talk to a Patient?,God talks to him. It'd be arrogant of me to assume that I'm better than God.,Yes. Its a new dentist. Hes far. I might be gone... three hours.
God talks to him. It'd be arrogant of me to assume that I'm better than God.,"So, you're a faith healer.",How do you know what he commands?
"I'm ok with faith healer, Doctor House.","Oh! That's a nice one, didn't Even go with I see an 'H' and a medical coat.","I am going to go with the best, Jan."
The nurses talk about you a lot.,"Ah, don't beliEve them.",Your nurse became your girlfriend?
God's asking for our trust. You can't love somebody and not trust them.,Trust has to be earned can't trust someone hiding in a closet.,Our lord is honored by his trust.
You don't trust anyone.,"You seem lucid, there's no confusion, no lethargy. What drugs have you been taking?","Oh, I trust them with my life."
"Nothing. Erm... some aspirin, I get focused on something, I forget to eat and next thing you know I've got a hunger headache.",So aspirin and hospitals are ok. That's an interesting attitude for someone who's kept any number of people from getting medical help.,"Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death."
Just because I beliEve in prayer doesn't mean I don't beliEve in germs and toxins.,That bottle's been opened before. You refilled it at the water cooler.,"Oh, dont tell me youre afraid of germs."
You refilled it at the water cooler. Yes.,How often do you do that?,I didnt do it.
"Few times an hour, he likes to stay hydrated. You think germs might have gotten in?",I think water might have gotten in.,"Yup. I told him if he didnt bite the hygienist, Id take him for ice cream."
Excuse me. I have a friend with boundary issues. He unlocks the door and then closes it behind him. Can this wait 5 minutes?,Is she dying?,45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me.
Is she dying? Yeah.,House leans to look at her around Wilson. Before the end of this consult?,"Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her."
They could build monuments to your self-centeredness.,"Patient, 15-yr-old, faith healer, hotline to God.",You know what would show them?
What are his symptoms?,"He is NOT a saint. He figures out what's going on in people's lives by watParkng, listening, deducing--","Well, I mean, you dont want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation."
You're worried about trademark infringement?,"Then he passes on advice from God so he can watch them jump, it's a power trip.","Youll always have the upper hand, when youve got a good aarm."
Ah! And there the similarities end. Why is he here?,I fear for the huMan race. A teenager claims to be the voice of God and people with advanced degrees are listening.,And hes picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do.
"Majority of Americans beliEve in a personal God, what are his symptoms?","Massive cramps, low sodium, turns out he's been drinking water non-stop, God told him to purify his body.","I dont object to the concept of a deity, but Im baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance."
Huge water intake would cause low sodium...,"Which would cause the cramping, yeah I get it.",Really? You dont have enough water in there? Your stomach?
What? That's it? You solved it. You just brought me out here to rant because faith annoys you?,Um hmm...,Shut up. I solved it.
"Are we certain he Even had a seizure? Him singing and healing, he does it all the time, doesn't he?",Isn't it interesting that religious behavior is so close to being crazy we can't tell them apart?,"Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again."
Or tuberous sclerosis.,Hmm...,Or it could be syfee.
Barging in. House! Why the hell did you let an unstable Patient wander the hallways?,His leash broke.,"Come on, were going to the hospital."
"The last thing a terminal Patient needs is to hear somebody taunt them with a cure. She was... freaked, she was angry...","And now she's not freaked and angry, and you are.","No, cause she didnt tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there!"
She says she's 'feeling better'. Maybe not singing or dancing but she's feeling just a little bit happy for the first time in months.,Sudden drop in pain could create euphoria. You should let her have her vacation. He takes a vicodin.,"But, I mean, do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?"
"Oh, that's great. And when vacation's over, when she crash lands from all this denial, she was dealing with her illness. Now her expectations are rising and you're not the one who has to be there when all that false hope gets yanked out from under her. He storms out.",Don't you guys have anything to do? Ducklings leave.,She was all crying.
Wandering in. You actually keep score?,Your MRI results aren't done yet go back to your room. No singing.,Trying to get a head count.
"Well you would get a point for figuring why the low sodium, what are my guy's points for?",Your trick about the spat between Doctor Cameron and Doctor Foreman apparently impressed someone.,"Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points."
"And the second point? House doesn't answer. Do you think it could be because I... healed Grace? She's been back to see me, I like her.",You like messing with people.,The queens brothers made promises to you and broke them.
Yes. I like helping people. I get a rush when I see the look on their faces when they realize their burdens are gone.,Hmm... but you make sure you're in the next state by the time the endorphins wear off and the arthritis comes back.,"Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because Im an MITtrained engineer."
That doesn't happen.,"Oh, you do extensive follow-up studies?",That... never happens...
God told me.,"That's not fair. We were having fun it's hard to keep sniping rationally when you throw a bomb like that in there. He walks back into his office, Boyd follows.",Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?
He spoke with me about you too.,"Forgive my enemies, nEver date a Taurus when Mercury's in retrograde, yeah, I learnt that one myself, the hard way.",I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
God says you look for excuses to be alone.,"See that is exactly the kind of brilliance that sounds deep, but you could say it about any person who doesn't pine for the social approval of Everyone he meets, which you were clEverly able to deduce about me by not being a moron.","Oh, okay. Ill just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool."
God wants you to invite Doctor Wilson to your poker game.,Don't talk to my Patient.,Tell him Dr.
What are you talking about?,You get all huffy when my Patient stumbles into yours in the hallway but you got no qualms about chatting my guy up.,"Okay, fine. Lets talk about snow. Do you think its snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
"This is fun, it's like password. Keep talking I'll jump in when I get a clue what the hell you're talking about.",God knows about my poker game.,Thats the password.
You think I told him?,Either that or I start going to Church Every Sunday. That would mess with my bowling league.,"Excuse me! You didnt tell him, did you?"
MRI shows an abnormal area.,Tuberous sclerosis.,Thats where they remove the uterus.
It accounts for all the symptoms.,All of them?,And to the sick and dying who make it possible.

God put them there for a reason.,You think God needs a telephone in your head to talk to you? Isn't he Everywhere? It's not a long-distance call.,What is the point of having them if we never use them?
"This is the way God does things, through natural law. If he went around doing big flashy miracles all the time, nobody would need faith.",How come Everyone else needs faith but you just get the guy screaming his existence in your ear? Wilson turns around to give him a look. Your turn.,"No! No. Im just saying, why does God get to do something that I dont?"
This is the way that the Lord often is with his chosen ones. He... he gives the most trials to those that he loves the most.,"How sweet.

I took some images of Grace Palmeri's cancer.,Yeah...?,"Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?"
He sighs and hands House one of the scans. Her tumor's shrunk.,He stops playing and looks at the scan. Don't tell my Patient.,"Yeah! Thats good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Lets do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"
He stops playing and looks at the scan. Don't tell my Patient.,I want all the records on miracle Woman.,"Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I dont think it gets bett."
They're friends. She thinks he saved her life.,Now we have obligingly offered medical proof that his delusions are true.,"I mean, not in a romantic way."

Why are you doing this?,Because you're being stupid. Wilson laughs. You know what you're risking by sleeping with a Patient!,I dont need them.
"Oh that's crap! You're not mad because I'm risking my job. You're not Even mad because I lied to you, you're mad because I lied to you and you couldn't tell!","Yeah, you got me nailed.","Okay, you have every right to be mad."
"Yeah, that's why you didn't want me in your poker game. Because when it comes to being in control, Gregory House leaves our faith healer kid in the dust. And that's why religious belief annoys you.

If a supreme being exists, he can squash you anytime he wants.",He knows where I am.,"Well, why dont you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"
Think it's yours.,He answers. Yeah. A pause. I'll be right there. He puts down the phone. Jesus is spiking a fEver. He's delusional.,We need to be careful in dealing with such a man.

You do know that I don't actually have magical powers.,I have faith.,Do you have powers?
Better off trying to slip some antibiotics into a meal...,Which antibiotics? We don't know what infection he's got.,Snort it down and keep eating!
Go as broad as you can.,Forget it our best hope is your silver tongue.,Maybe something less personal.
What if it's not an infection?,Were you not paying attention when I was doing my murder scene metaphor?,Theres the man of the hour.
"What if the tuberous sclerosis IS guilty? It had the guns in its hands, it was standing over the--",It doesn't cause fEver.,You stand accused of murder.
It causes Everything else. What if the fEver's the innocent bystander? FEver could have been set off by something he picked up anywhere. Could have been a bug he got here.,He suddenly stops. Or a bug he gave here. He gave it to your Patient. That's why her tumor shrank the virus went after the cancer first.,I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
He suddenly stops. Or a bug he gave here. He gave it to your Patient. That's why her tumor shrank the virus went after the cancer first.,"For 200 years, there've been reports of wild viruses that target tumors.",So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
You think he gave her rabies?,One of the virus types most prone to go after cancer cells is herpes.,Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?
"Herpes encephalitis. It would fit. Seizure, low sodium, Even the blurred vision and it would mean, if you're right, Grace's cancer is coming back. You're not going to be able to convince them. They don't want any more tests. They don't wanna--",They can't argue with the mark of Cain.,"Wow... Oh, wait a second, I cant tonight..."
I'm not going to change my mind! No more tests! God knows the way.,"Walking in. Ok, let's start with the shirt. Wilson walks in behind him.","Thats it. Im done. I dont care when the baby comes, no more betting."
What are you doing? He bats House's hands away from taking his shirt off. What are you doing?,"I'm on a mission from God. If you won't let me undress you, then strip.","Right, will you excuse us for one moment?"
What's he doing? What's going on?,That Woman you helped? You gave her a virus.,What the hell is he up to?
"She's healed, I have a gift!","Gift is jewelry, socks. What you have is herpes encephalitis. The only way you could have transmitted it is by scratParkng one of your own sores and touParkng another person.","Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my gods house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?"
"Herpes... that's something you get from sex, right?",Either that or cold sores. Your kid got it from the sex.,"Its normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? Its just as normal as anyone elses."
"No, no, no sores He tries to get off the bed, House pushes him back down. No, my body's clean, they examined me when I came in! No sores!",Herpes hides.,"Oh, okay, get ready for this."
Dad I've nEver Ever--,Do you Ever wonder why a perfect Parkld of God should feel so desperate to purify his body that he needed to scarf down a dozen gallons of water a,"Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep?"

"Relax. A few Hail Mary's, a little acyclovir, he'll be picking up angels again in no time.",Come in.,Dont tell me prayer doesnt work.
He stands at the door. My father told me I have to apologize to you.,You still hearing voices?,Wheres my father?
Nods. You're lucky. You go through life with a certainty that what you're doing is right. I know how comforting that is. Good luck. He leaves.,You're not going to give me my final point? He starts taking off the outer shirt over his white t-shirt.,"Okay. Ill leave. But just know, every time I come in here, Ill be thinking of you."
You knew it was me?,Who else?,You know its me?
You knew it was me? Who else?,You don't think God should get a point knocked off?,"Youre dodging the question, I knew it was you."
The tumor shrank.,Because of a virus! He puts on his black leather jacket.,"Well, I, I really couldnt."
"Do you know what the odds are? She had to have the right type of cancer he had to have the right type of virus, the exposure had to be--",She won the lottery.,"While unlikely, its still a statistical possibility."

Walking in. Well nobody's as perfect as you are. It is possible to beliEve in something and still fail to live up to it.,So... how's your girlfriend?,"Okay focus. Focus. Youre in the right building, youre with the right people what happened?"
She got a little extra time out of this. Not a lot.,She didn't crash.,Uhhuh. But I thought she had more time.
No. She said she's happier when she beliEves in something bigger than she is.,She still beliEves.,The girl lies.
Faith. She's going to Florence.,You're moving out? They exit the hospital.,We know where shes going.
They exit the hospital. Yeah.,You moving back in with me?,To a hospital?
I don't think that's a great idea.,But we're ok?,Thats not a good idea.
"Yeah, he's not proud of me, he's proud of Jesus. Everything I do right is God's work Everything I do wrong is my own damn fault. Chase puts the paper on the table as House walks in","Cop with a sense of humor. Differential diagnosis. Tosses the files out to the team Guy's in the ER, bleeding on Everybody.",Oh! Did you hear that?! My dads proud of me! My dads proud of me.
Good point. How about! drugs?,Tox screen was clean. He did howEver get hit by a bullet. Just mentioning.,It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
He was shot?,"No, somebody threw it at him.",Was? He dead?
The guy who shot him. Reliable witness.,"His name's Baby Shoes, how bad can he be?","Sorry. Hey, whos not the murderer?"
He got CO poisoning outdoors? Very sarcastic,"Yeah, all 'cause those bastards didn't ratify Kyoto.",Im sorry. He doesnt really understand sarcasm.
"If it was the cop car, his partner would be sick.","Well maybe she is, but just doesn't have as good a sense of humor. Also check his personal car, his work, home, I'll check the precinct.","Well, Im sorry but its hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!"
"No, you pRobably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place. We have a guy there checking things out.",Bangs a vent with his cane Sounds ok.,"No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom."
How about the gas intake valve?,Looks great.,You want to do this junior?
It's down in the furnace room.,Your system's fine. If you had a carbon monoxide leak half the force would be sick.,"No, dear god, no, its in the trash can."
Then why are you here?,I was wondering if you could do me a favor.,Good thing were friends or wed be fucking you in the ass right now.
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.,"Yeah. to the female cop I've uh, I've got a disability. Hands the cop lots of tickets",Im asking you to do me a favor.
These are speeding tickets.,"A lot of emergencies. She stares at him. He's feeling better now, but you nEver know.","I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks."
I'll see what we can do.,Where does your partner sit?,"Okay, that we may be able to do."
The place is a cesspool. But I don't think I need to test for anything.,"Nope, waste of time.",I have a weird feeling about this place.
You know about the marijuana?,I've heard rumors since junior high.,What makes you think wed have weed?
The cop's acting high because he is high. He's got-,Legionnaires' disease. It's a good thing Joe got shot the whole precinct would have gotten wiped out. Anarchy on the streets-,"So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot."
It takes 48 hours to test for Legionnaires'.,"And only 2 seconds to recognize that the symptoms fit while staring at the rancid, unchanged water of an AC unit.","Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my bodys always been a little faster than Western medicine."
"Marijuana explains the high carboxy, the cloudy lungs, and the happiness.",Pot doesn't explain the fact that he's gotten worse since he was admitted.,"Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine."
He can physically see. His brain just can't process it.,No chance this is a practical joke?,I have the sight.
Must be from the trauma.,Bullet fragments just happened to hit the same spot in both lobes?,"Yeah, Im sure it was just the initial shock of it all."
The clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertebral arteries.,Great!,"Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process."
"We can't do an MRI. If the bullet fragment's magnetic, they'll move and rip his brain apart.","Well, let's flip a coin. Heads MRI, tails he dies.",Is he gonna be okay?
"Police-issued Kevlar vests don't have the ceramic plate insert that would shatter a bullet. They would just catch it. So the bullet shattered on its own, meaning Baby Shoes was using .38 caliber hollow points, which, unfortunately, are ferromagnetic.",It's just so cool that you know that!,It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
We could do an angio to find the clotting.,Waste of time. The skull creates too much artifact. We'll nEver get a decent view.,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you.
Next best thing to an MRI.,And a waste of time.,A functional MRI of my brain.
An angio might show!,"OH GOD!it's a coup! Fine go do your angio. When you're done wasting your time, come meet me down in the morgue.",Why does he have to go over there?
"You don't have to like someone to be their doctor. Goes onto the intercom Hey how you doing there buddy? Just sit still, and we'll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time. Smiles slightly Happy?",What did the angio tell us?,Is that the Matsuhashi B400?
What are you looking for?,I called my mom. She didn't pick up. What did the angio tell us?,"What do you mean, my tricks?"
That Foreman should be off this case.,He's a neurologist. Unless you think the Patient's optic nerve is in his spleen.,"Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I dont understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. Ill just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired."
He doesn't like cops.,"Very sarcastic Foreman, policemen are our friends. If you and I Ever get separated shopping!","Wait, officers, are you sure you dont want to interrogate him?"
I was just busting the guy's chops.,"See! He was just busting the guy's chops. Foreman is essential to solving this case. Medically, what did the angio tell us?","You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it."
"There appears to be some clotting, possibly around the Circle of Willis. Based on the progression of symptoms, the clot is growing. We need to cut into-",Saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam up ahead.,"Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but thats my issue, not yours."
Angio can't tell us that kind of information.,"Oh, so you're saying it was just a waste of time?","Again, that gives us no information."
It gave us some information without killing him.,You don't know that an MRI will kill him!,He died so that you could find what you have lost.
The bullets have a ferrous base!,Little tiny pieces trapped in his head. They're not going anywhere! House puts in ear plugs,"Well, thanks, but you should know were a little concerned about this being used in weapons."
Maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.,"Surgeons say inoperable, and the Patient's on blood thinners. Other than that, perfect plan. Pulls a gun out of a plastic bag",Wow! Wow! And its definitely all gone? Theres nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
You got a better plan?,Much!,Nah. I like my plan better.
Did anyone hear a!Sees House with the gun,"I shot him! He's dead! Sees that Foreman is still grinning, and looks at him funny",Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howards door. He was terrifying.
"The bullet split into four fragments, no exit wounds.",Only used a half-load of gunpowder.,"Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute."
It won't be exactly precise comparing the location on an x-ray to an MRI.,How unprofessional was Foreman?,"No, thats not how it works."
"Worse than usual, better than you. He berated Joe for being a bad cop.",Berated or humiliated?,"I just talked to Joey, I justI want to see how you were."
I'm not sure. I didn't have my thesaurus with me.,"One implies he took pleasure in it. I want to know if it was repressed black anger, or just giddiness.","Yeah, Im not even sure if its the right word."
Whoa! Whoa! You think I'm sick?,I think that an appropriate response to watParkng your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.,"Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
The fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.,"Using the intercom Dr. Foreman, Dr. Chase requests your assistance! He sees Chase struggling with the body in the background",And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.
I can't Even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.,"Well if I'd shot a live person, there's a lot more paperwork.","You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay?"
Then it won't be a pRoblem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake and explain why a cancer Patient has a bullet hole in his head.,The Man donated his body to science!,"Speaking of funerals, why dont you go ahead and go die."
"Do not turn that on, House!","You're mad because I put a bullet in his head. At the worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out.","Well dont turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know youve been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year."
"You're mad because I put a bullet in his head. At the worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out.",My bad.,You mad? You mad at me?
"Clears throat They have to, uh, shut down the magnet to fix it. MRI's gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.",Well it doesn't matter we obviously can't use it on this Patient.,"Youre right. Youre right, youre right. And you know why? Its because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where were gonna go? The Steamtown Mall."
"No, but there are other doctors in this hospital, and other Patients.",That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment. I'm sure not pulling my weight.,Weve seen you do that character before though.
The blindness hasn't.,Echo his heart.,"Well, it has."
Looking for what? The pRoblem is obviously neurological.,Clots are in his brain. The source of the clots may not be. Do a complete transthoracic echocardiogram. Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.,"Okay, theres a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours."
Talking to House through the glass I'm not sick!,Did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain and had to have a hole drilled into his skull to reliEve the pressure? Hilarious!,"You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window!"
"Someone laughs, they're dying? That's absurd!",But not funny.,"Well, how you died was funny."
"If I'm not sick, all you're doing is locking me up with the source. I'll get sick prove you right.","If you're not sick, it's not contagious and you've got nothing to worry about.","How could you have gotten it from me, Im not sick."
No you can't! You blew up the maParkne!,"Not the portable one, Chuckles. Foreman stops laughing Chase and Cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet riddled head.","Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?"
Wher! where you going?,"To the office, got work to do. Eat your meals, take your temperature Every half hour, and any meds I comMand you to take.",Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?
So I'm just a regular Patient now?,No! You get your own thermometer!,"Thats right, youre not."
No! You get your own thermometer!,"Check your blood, anyone with an elevated SED rate gets to be Foreman's new roomie.","I guess thats why we have a temp, huh?"
He should be a part of this.,He's a Patient.,We should help him out.
He's not irrational!,He's not objective.,Michael thats irrational.
He's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.,Right.,I want him to have all the urine he needs.
Kind of mushy.,"Cingulate cortex control emotions. This mushy spot explains the euphoria. Question is, what's causing the mush?",Its crunchy. Just the way I like it.
"Question you might want to ask! a neurologist. Foreman is a selfish jerk, but he's a neurologist, and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.",This is why he shouldn't be here.,Turns out it was Tupperman.
"If you think he screwed up at that apartment, you'd keep it to yourself. No! I-","Well we'll nEver know as long as he's not here, he's just like any other Patient.","No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise."
"West Nile, or Eastern Equine Encephalitis!",Test Foreman's blood.,Whats going on?
"Test Foreman's blood. Given that he's the only one that got it, person to person transmission is less likely then some sort of deadly toxin that Foreman picked up at the guy's home. Who wants to go next?",Whoa! You're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy that doesn't consider you a friend?,"Renters. Ok, Im gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Lets get going. Im gonna stay here and fight. If you dont hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch."
He's just a Patient right? It's the job.,Hey! You don't have to go anywhere. Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab. Foreman brought back samples of Everything.,"This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos cause theyre about to go bad, youre just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding."
"What was that, 'Who wants to go next'? Some kind of test?","Don't worry. You made the right call. Foreman stumbled into whatEver it is without knowing, and he's way smarter than you are.","He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London."
"Samples tested negative for toluene, arsenic, and lead.",What about the blood?,"Wait, I dont understand."
"We have to go back to Joe's apartment, get more samples",No one goes back to that place 'til we know what we are looking for. Get some of that cop tape stick it over the doors and the windows.,Hey Joe! Weve got a couple of things weve got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
I'll take all the HAZMAT precautions. The chance of infection is next to nothing.,"Yeah, I was nEver that great a math, but next to nothing is! higher than nothing, right?","Wash those bea Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella."
It would be his fault if we did.,We should get a sample directly from Joe's brain,Yeah well unless we tell him.
We can't do a biopsy. There's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.,Well I don't think that this is the time to be pointing fingers. He pauses I didn't give Foreman any.,"I, I dont, I dont understand, how can you be straight?"
Stops and looks at House You wanna give Foreman a brain biopsy?,"Come on, really, who doesn't?","Thats not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens."
This could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.,"Without a fEver, not a chance.","Um, yeah, no, well."
Joe had a fEver!,He also had Legionella.,I dont think thats what they were talking about Joe!
"The mush might be forming an abscess. And since there was inflammation in the lining of the ventricles, it makes sense. The staph releases toxins, causes neurodegeneration, causes a lesion.",This is a waste of time. He begins to walk to leave the room,"Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so Im gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob."
We should put an Ommaya reservoir in Foreman's brain to start administrating antibi-,"If I'm gonna be arguing with Foreman, I may as well do it directly. Turns around and walks out. Chase turns to look at Cameron.",Yeah. Heres another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryls idea.
"Kernig's sign negative. Brudzinski's sign, single positive. Looks over at Joe, who is moaning somewhat uncomfortably Patient Joe Lureia distal and proximal arm contractures. Duration four seconds.","Hits his cane on the window, gaining Foreman's attention Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.","Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds."
"gets up from the bed and looks at House like he's crazy which not to negate he isn't Most...commonly? You wanna treat me like any other Patient, do it. But the House I know nEver uses phrases like 'most commonly'",You're not laughing anymore.,"About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms."
No. Pause Think that's a!.good thing?,Gives his typical House Snark Unsure face Sort of doubt it.,"Oh yeah, no no no."
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.,Which I would've seen in your MRI Sets down the cane and pulls out a paper from his jacket Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.,Something just moves past my leg!
Gets up and walks over to House near the window Let me see the MRI.,There was no abscess on the image.,Okay. Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
Let me see it then.,"Furrows his eyebrows and smirks I liked you better when you were jolly. walks over and gets the MRI, placing it on the window for Foreman to look at it.","Im sorry, I thought youd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room."
MRI was taken over an hour ago. That soft spot can now be an abscess.,"If it was staph you would have a fEver, which you don't!","Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down."
Walks over to the window and puts the thermometer up to the window 101.6.,Looks at it quizzically What idiot gave you that?,How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
Is there a pRoblem? Stutters Uh!Square.,Tell me your date of birth., Square is fine.
Square again. Why is he here?,Because my neurologist is having surgery!,Oh my God!
I thought I was just another Patient.,You didn't beliEve that crap did you? Continues doing the procedure Date of birth.,What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
"The Ommaya reservoir is inserted into the parietal lobe. My spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory.","Oops! Did you say Ommaya? I could have sworn you said biopsy. Hey, I'm just messing with your head. Mother's maiden name, please.",So youre attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.
How is he?,Still dying. House continues to play with the ball and doing it with precision,"My brother, can you tell me how he is?"
We have Foreman's biopsy results. Non-specific signs of inflammation,That's it?,Oh wow.
His result for staph Negative. He's not Even a carrier.,"Well, at least Foreman was wrong, too.",When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Can I go to Joe's apartment now?,No. Go back to the lab. Start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected.,"Uh, why dont you come with me."
Start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected. For what?,"Everything. Bacteria, toxins, fungus, anything that likes to feast on brain.","Yeah, but what if the experiment works?"
"Bacteria, toxins, fungus, anything that likes to feast on brain. That's thousands!",Then Hurry!,Im studying onecelled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
"Then Hurry! Cameron, suit up. You're gonna monitor Foreman. He's on to hand contractures he'll be on Anton's blindness soon. Run hourly checks because when he does go blind he won't be able to tell us. We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we'll see how far behind Joe he is.",Why are you still here?,"Look Joey, theres nothing I can do."
You're being cautious. You're being!common. When you don't give a crap-,turns around angrily and interrupts Wilson How Many of your guys have caught cancer from their Patients? Let me know when that happens. Then we can have this conversation.,"If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful."
"It's just another case, huh?","I'll bet you can Even have unprotected sex with your cancer Patients without Even catParkng a damn thing. Boy, I wish I had your job. Turns around","Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine."
He's over his limit on morphine.,Where's Cameron?,I think hes stoned again.
What are you doing? yelling Foreman!,Imagine being constantly reminded of the pain you're about to be in.,I cant believe that you yelled at my boss!
"Hitting the window, yelling Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!",So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy. Either the morphine kills him or the pain does.,What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Obviously flabbergasted You're condoning this?,I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
I'm gonna make you feel better.,Joe has a new symptom hyperalgesia.,"No, no. Im gonna cheer you up. Here we go."
Joe has a new symptom hyperalgesia.,The infection is spreading into the pain center of the brain.,"Im in a lot of pain, Rick!"
"His brain is telling him that his whole body is in pain. Because of the location, the painkillers do nothing.",Suit up. Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.,"Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?"
What if he used cedar wood to hide the pot smell? Aureobasidium fungus can grow there.,Did you find any cedar wood anywhere?,I know exactly what hes talking about.
"No. But maybe..,",Maybe what?,No. Maybe. I dont know.
Maybe what? looks at Foreman Maybe somebody can go back and take a second look? And why aren't you pissed off that Cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?,sitting on a chair in the hallway Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?,"So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?"
I decided you were wrong.,"God, you're weak. Guy steals your article, tells you you're not his friend. You still wanna risk your life for him.","Oh, umm, Im just getting rid of a couple of things."
Foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.,Wow.,Ive got the Neosporin.
Wow. Yeah.,"God, you're weak.",Yep. Oh... wow.
I'm not here for Foreman I'm here to save myself.,"Ehh!.bounces head back and forth Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim.",Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
"Ehh!.bounces head back and forth Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim. That's why you're wearing the suit. You wanted to be here. He just gave you the excuse. What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?",Give me the bag. grabs something out Mildewed dishtowel.,Youd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
To retest for staph.,"What is that, mouse droppings?",In case I get sick.
Hamster droppings. Could carry Toxocara. Explain the blindness.,Now that I recognize as oven crud.,It is random debris.
Could be meat with TriParknella. Would explain the high fEver.,What's with rye bread?,My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs.
Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning which would explain the contractures.,Three loaves.,"So, in the year 2000, fungus and even black mold was discovered growing in the cave."
Three loaves. So?,"goes silent for a moment, thinking You're going back in there.","Just the bread, its fresh baked."
"goes silent for a moment, thinking You're going back in there.",talking to Cameron Guy who lives on takeout pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.,I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
talking to Cameron Guy who lives on takeout pizza does not buy three loaves of rye. That's looking too far into the future unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.,You on the roof yet?,"Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
"Yeah, I'm here. I don't see any birds.",Whistle or something. Cut to House looking outside Do that come hither thing.,"Uh, uh, uh, I am here."
Cut to House looking outside Do that come hither thing. Whoa.,"They came that fast because it's their behavior pattern. Joe's been feeding them. Now look down, you see a river of pigeon turd?","Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room."
Uhhh... no. There's barely any.,"It's not weird, it's cheap. Joe's the guy who looks for the easy way.",No! There is.. there is noone else!
"It's not weird, it's cheap. Joe's the guy who looks for the easy way.",PRobably been stealing cable from his neighbors. Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings? You see a shovel or a dustpan?,"Weird? What? Whats weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didnt like Mexican food, because Im making fajitas!!"
Found a scraper it looks used. Sitting on a bucket.,Bucket full of pigeon crap. Perfect home for Cryptococcus neoforMans.,I found it under the seat.
opening the bucket Yup.,"Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness and intractable pain.","Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon."
He has multiple system failure. Foreman.,Foreman. Foreman! Time of death.,"So, system kinda broke down huh?"
Time of death. No. continues,Time of death. 1226 p.m.,"A minute, an hour, a month."
"You high, Popo? shoots Joe, who goes down laughing","Cop with a sense of humor. You pointing at Foreman check the cop car. Also check his personal car, work, home!. Shot of Joe screaming, Foreman laughing.","Look Joe, I just, I just dont want to get your hopes up real high."
"You die, I die. It's not gonna happen.","Time of death, 1226 PM.","No! No! No, you dont die! Dont die!"
"Time of death, 1226 PM.",I need a bone saw.,"How would you say he died, then?"
I need a bone saw. I'm sorry.,You said you would --,Power saw kinda got away from me there.
I wish I could,"I just want a little tiny slice of this guy's brain, that's all I need, just enough to tell me what's killing Foreman.","I cant. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I cant."
A thin slice of Joe's brain could also cause a public health crisis.,It's not a good idea to scream fire Every time someone lights a match.,You think youre doing science by cutting up that brain?
"Don't downplay this, House. You put both of them in isolation for a reason. Joe's death elevates the situation to a biosafety lEvel 3.",shivering Oooh. LEvel 3. We should call Jack Bauer.,Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Rosss situation?
I called the CDC.,"Well, tell them we'll be really, really careful.",I went to the doctor.
"We don't have the proper equipment for you to be really, really careful! You can do whatEver you want to Foreman but the CDC will do this autopsy.","WhatEver. The point is, we'll be lucky to get results in three days.","Fine, just try not to look too alive."
I told them how urgent this is,-- and they told you!,Wow. What did you tell them?
We'll have the results in! three days.,"Ah, that's a shame, because Foreman will nEver get a chance to know what it was, because he'll be dead in 36 hours.",I confirmed with Raskin Design and theyre expecting the both of you in an hour.
"Well, you have 36 hours to figure out which one it is.","Foreman, c'mere, fast. He sends a hammer and pick through the window.",How can you not know which one?
What's going on? When are they doing the autopsy?,You're doing it. Now. Ever study how they used to do ice-pick lobotomies?,When does the CSI team get here?
Read about it in med school. Why would I,"Shove an ice-pick into the eye socket just above the tear duct. Bang it a couple of times with the hammer, get a sample.",I need an answer!
"walking up to House Foreman, you can't do it! You'd be in violation of",Can't do the time if you're not alive.,Ill have to talk to the manager.
to a nurse You I need you to suit up. Get that equipment away from Dr. Foreman. Foreman grabs the tools.,"Take your time, guys! Just tell them to go slow it won't be your fault.","So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh?"
"Foreman, we don't Even know what kind of contagion we're dealing with.",Which is why we need to chop into the guy's head.,"Well, I just spoke to Carol."
Which is why we need to chop into the guy's head. It's dangerous!,"Not to you, Foreman.","All right. Now, you dont want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. Oh, my God. What is with you guys?"
There are other ways to diagnose you.,"Yeah? You have the answer? He sees the guys almost suited up. Foreman, do it now!",Im here to take you to Kings Landing and bring back Lady Starks daughters in exchange.
"I am warning you, do not Foreman starts to Parkp away at the bed.",What are you doing?,"Honey, you made the bed again."
That didn't feel right. He's blind.,"He thinks he can see, same as the cop.","Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy."
We need something to bag the sample.,Forget it. You just biopsied a mattress.,We need the stuff.
"No, no, I'm fine! House, there's the sample, test it! You've gotta test that sample!","Apparently I was optimistic about the 36 hours. Intractable, unbearable pain is up next. Sure you don't want to reconsider that whole autopsy thing?","Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?"
We should retest him for bacterial meningitis.,"If it was meningitis, we'd all be sick.","Because, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married."
His CSF might show signs of,"LP's pointless. We already did a brain biopsy, it was negative. Quick shot of said biopsy.","The Airport, Carol and Ross are waiting for Emily and Susan to deplane."
"If it was toxic mold, I'd be sick.",How do we know you're not sick?,I smell mold.
Do I seem happy to you?,NEver. Chase guffaws.,You seem happy.
It was funny.,"Well, let's assume it's not blood-borne.","For what its worth, I thought it was humorous."
What about arbovirus?,Start treatment.,You cant catch a computer virus.
"For arbovirus? You think our Jersey-beat cop has spent a lot of time exploring deep, dark Africa?","Treatment for Everything likely or unlikely. If you can think of it, treat for it.","Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate."
"We'll box his liver, trash his kidneys! there's got to be a better way.",Of course there's a better way!,We bury him?
Where are you going?,To see if I can find another brain to biopsy.,"Yeah, it was amazing."
Foreman swallows all the pills. Hello?,in a hazmat suit on a hands-free phone I'm at the cop's place. You have to retrace your steps.,"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed."
You don't think the treat him for Everything approach is enough?,taking out Steve Where did you start your search?,Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
taking out Steve Where did you start your search? The kitchen.,"You're going to tell me Everything you did, Everything you touched. If you went to the john I want to know when and why.","Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve."
"I started with samples from the mold in his sink. House lets Steve walk around in the sink, sniff the counter, the fridge, the toilet, etc. We next see House and Steve up in the cop's garden.",What next?,There is a hive of bees outside the front door.
That's it. Then I left. What do we do now?,Wait for Steve McQueen to get giddy.,This is so fun.
How's Foreman? looks at House's laptop You're accessing a webcam?,"Cuddy's shower. Are you a fan of the Brazilian? I, hmm!",I found your webcam and replaced the video feed.
Is that your kitchen?,"Well, obviously I couldn't bring him here. He's been exposed to whatEver Foreman's got.","No! But its the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day."
You infected Steve?! Why didn't you just get a rat from the pet store?,Because I needed one with a clean medical history. Who knows what kind of antibiotics they gave those rats.,"The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat youre going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beadyeyed little mother whos been biting you all week."
"So this is your plan, just sit here and watch your rat all day?","Eh, it shouldn't take long. Got the AC blasting, I soaked the floor of his cage!. Wilson looks fairly disgusted. As soon as he gets sick, I do an autopsy.","whhh wait, youre gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?"
As soon as he's dead.,"Right after he gets sick, there's a good chance he'll get hit in the head with a cane-shaped object.","Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour."
Normally you just use your Patients as lab rats. It's a nice change. pulls up a chair,First symptom is euphoria.,"No, no. Its kind of crazy. Ive never fooled around in the lab before."
How do you know if a rat's euphoric?,"He doesn't usually climb on his water bottle like that, does he?","Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell."
The seizures only seem to happen when she's in her car seat. She starts to rock and grunt.,She responsive?,And the car ride puts her to sleep.
"No, no, it's like she's in a zone. And her abdominal muscles become dystonic.",Big word. Someone's been on the interweb.,"Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?"
"I looked up a few articles on epilepsy. You know, there's actually some really great youth soccer leagues that would Cater specifically to her special needs, and I think it might explain why she's been having a hard time in pre-school.","Well, let's confirm your diagnosis before you have her held back.",Thats interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.
You're a goof!,"Takes one to know one, loser! Wait, that means I'm a loser. Scratch that. These episodes, she gets sweaty afterwards?","Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell."
"These episodes, she gets sweaty afterwards? Soaking wet.",She seem upset by them or just tired?,"Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice"
"No, she kind of thinks it's funny.","You mix rocking, grunting, sweating, and dystonia with concerned parents and you get an amateur diagnosis of epilepsy.","Its kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile?"
"In actuality, all your little girl is doing is saying yoo hoo to the hoo-hoo. She's what?",MarParkng the penguin. Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood. Finding Nemo. The little girl thinks all of these euphemisms are hilarious.,"So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?"
That was funny.,It's called gratification disorder. Sort of a misnomer if one was unable to gratify oneself!that would be a disorder.,"Yello. No, Rachels not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, byebye. Hey, whos this uh, this Casey?"

This is horrifying.,Epilepsy is horrifying. Teach your girl about privacy and she'll be fine. hands the girl a lollipop Here you go.,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen."
One afternoon and you're on pace to set the record for most Patients seen in a month.,"You're upset that I'm doing clinic hours? Wow, that is so like rain on your wedding day.",The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.
"For the past three hours, I've been on the phone with the CDC while you are wai","Yeah, how's that going, by the way?",Im on the phone!
They promised to expedite,Tough to do an autopsy when they haven't Even picked up the body.,"I understand that were under contract, and I dont know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, were not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised."
"It's tough to treat your Patient when you're not Even on the same floor. Go, clinic is covered.","I go watch the meds drip into his IV, you think that'll make the treatment work faster?","So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"
"Go to your office, play with your ball, write on your whiteboard, insult your team, do whatEver it is you do to figure things out.","Feeling guilty? It's not too late to change your mind. Go call the CDC, tell them you were just joshin'.","You know, I think Im just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team."
You can see again? Treatment's working.,"The question is, which treatment?","Yknow, II gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle."
"We'll start weaning him off, one at a time. Which one do we start with?",I don't care if you do it alphabetically. Just stay on top of his vision first sign of regression means we've taken him off the wrong one. Chase enters.,"lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester."
Toxic side effect of his meds.,Philosophical question how do you want to die?,What did I do?
Philosophical question how do you want to die? Old age.,"Your choice is currently between four hours from now and fourteen hours from now, so I'm assuming that means you want the latter.","Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me."
The cocktail's working. My vision's almost completely restored.,The meds are curing what's in your head but they're trashing your pancreas. That's why you're puking and you can't stand up without screaming.,Theres no need for us to play games.
I don't care! I can handle the pain of the pancreatitis.,Think you can handle a life without a pancreas?,"Would you rather me say Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?"
Dad? And so it is Foreman's father will from hereon be named Rodney in the transcript.,"Yeah, you two can get caught up later. Sir, I need you to come with me.","The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meeras father."
"House! Uh, what is this?","He's not a what, he's a who. They Even have the right to vote now. Rodney Foreman, Cuddy. Cuddy, Rodney Foreman. Cuddy and Rodney shake hands.","A squeegee comes up from the garage, right?"
"Nice to meet you, ma'am.",This is Foreman's dad.,Are those your teeth?
"Yeah, I got that.",Dr.,Yeah I get that.
"Mr. Foreman, I am doing Everything I can to get the CDC",Won't be soon enough.,"Okay, you know what, Dwight."
-- and my decision to follow public health safety protocols,"Oh, don't blame the rules. Don't hang this on policy and protocol.","It became a safety issue, sir."
"Steve's still acting normal, no sign of contractures.","They've got the cop's body in a locked, airtight bag.",No. Not after what happened with Steve.
And a guard on the door. Those feds are seriously paranoid.,"He hasn't gotten up to pee in hours, he's due.",Theres got to be a way to protect them.
"You haven't sprinkled Senokot granules on his donut, his bowels would open up like the Red Sea.",He wouldn't eat the donut.,Ive already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Have you seriously been down here for hours?,No. I had to pee a couple times.,Have you been here all night?
You've got to stop blaming Cuddy for this.,"Given that it is her fault, it seems appropriate.","No, were both to blame."
"That part is her fault. The part where somebody wasted his time in a basement plotting the overthrow of a government agency, that one's on you.",The only thing I can do is think. You can pretty much do that anywhere. As long as no one's bugging me.,"Well, I mean look its, its not your fault, you know."
Only it's moving much faster in Foreman.,"Good! It's an anomaly, anomalies tell us things. Why would this go faster in Foreman, what's different?","You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon."
Could be a different strain of the same disease?,"Right! We were wasting all this time looking for an unknown disease, we should be looking for a different strain of an unknown disease!",More often they die young.
"He's into physical fitness, he could have had a more powerful immune system, stronger metabolism!. Foreman's black.",What? How long have you been sitting on this information?,"Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist."
"Lupus, gout, glaucoma, osteoarthritis, hypertension, diabetes, stop me any time they all affect black people more than whites.","Check Everything. Bacterials, fungals, toxins, parasites look for anything with a documented racial disparity. House looks at Steve's webcam. Wait.","Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people."
The rat's showing symptoms?,No. He's completely healthy. Maybe that's the difference between Foreman and the cop.,"Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?"
"And the punishment for violating those regulations?! Is it death? Hmm? Because frankly, I'm okay if you get a fine, a suspension, hell, you can spend a couple of years in jail if it saves my life! House comes by.",You're dying too fast.,"Oh, so many crazy rules."
Couldn't agree more.,"Hey, Cuddy. Having a nice visit?",I could not have agreed with you more.
Having a nice visit? What's that?,tries to speak with a vial in his mouth Legion takes the vial out Legionella pneumophila.,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
And why are you carrying a vial of it around with you?,Foreman was perfectly healthy before he got this infection.,Just a small tranquiliser.
Why would that happen?,No idea. Just know that it did.,How does that happen?
So you want to infect Foreman?,You gonna tattle to the CDC?,I want to clamp Michaels face in a George Foreman grill.
"The meds can't help me but a disease can? Forget it, just take the pain away and put me under!",If I put you under I can't monitor your pain. If I can't monitor your pain I can't tell if the legionella's working.,"Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a little turned on."
"I'm not consenting to you giving me House drops in the vial, which shatters on the floor. What was that?","Hmmm, wish there could have been a puff of smoke or something. Would have been much more dramatic. Keep your slippers on, wouldn't want you to cut your foot.","Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had brokenleg serum at every corner drugstore."
The legionella helping?,Yeah.,"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so were scrambling to find new funding."
Yeah. Good.,"But not great. It didn't fix anything, it just slowed it down. The whole point was to give Steve a little more time to get sick.","Here, why dont you put these on while I find a shirt and sportcoat to match."
What are you going to do if he nEver gets sick?,Brilliant.,Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.
What are you going to do if he nEver gets sick? Brilliant.,"Cameron, what kind of illnesses affect huMans but not rats?",Im a little sick but I dont want to miss my date with Andy.
Why are you asking me that?,Because I'm sure you spent the first twelve years of your life dreaming of being a vet. The rat is not getting sick. Cameron is not getting sick.,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
Cameron is not getting sick. Sorry.,It's okay. It's not your fault. Presumably you're still healthy because whatEver it is is not blood borne. Steve has no excuse he did Everything that Foreman did.,"Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it?"
Foreman tested negative for Every bacterial infection that would affect his brain.,And what infections could he be positive for but test negative for?,Everyone but Sheldon is in the kitchen of the apartment.
"Now, what if the Patient is infected, but has no antibodies what if the body is not fighting the infection? Why would","Neh, eh, I asked first. Let's start with the 'what', we'll deal with the 'why' later.",Oh no!
If the body doesn't recognize the infection our tests come back negative and the disease rampages through the body unstopped.,Exactly like the cop and exactly like Foreman.,"Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you?"
"Exactly like the cop and exactly like Foreman. And what if the Patient was then exposed to a second infection, like legionella? The body would recognize that infection, increase the white count, send in the troops to start fighting, and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire. So the question becomes, what type of bacterial infection affects huMans and not rats, and the huMan body would be unlikely to recognize.","The answer is listeria. I'm starting you on amp and gent. Transcriber's note that's ampicillin and gentamicin, two antibiotics.","Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to."
So you're basing this theory on the tests being negative and your rat being healthy?,And the fact that Legionnaire's is helping you.,And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities.
But the medicine you wanna give me will put an end to that.,Yeah.,Nothing can stop that now.
And if it's not listeria all the gent will do is cure the Legionnaire's Disease and put whatEver is killing me back into overdrive.,Stop asking me questions based on the premise that I'm wrong. The antibiotics are in the airlock.,"Im sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you?"
I think the first biopsy didn't give us the answer because you didn't go deep enough. I want you to do a white matter brain biopsy.,Absolutely. Don't blame you. The world is such a compliCated place if you've got higher reasoning skills. I'm often jealous of smaller animals and retarded Parkldren. Take the antibiotics.,"You are a gambler, arent you?"
There can be minimal damage if it's done right. If the surgeons drill where I tell them to drill.,"One slip, you could spend the rest of your life not being able to keep your drool in your mouth.","Thank you. And while youre thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death."
I'd rather be disabled than dead.,"Sure, I make it look oh-so-sexy. It's actually not as glamorous as you may think.",Im not disabled and neither are you.
The biopsy will tell us for sure what's wrong.,The antibiotics could do the same thing!,From all seven kingdoms
Could! Not will.,"We try it, we see!","Oh, uh, no."
The antibiotics will bring back the pain!,Pain makes us make bad decisions.,"I know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids."
"Pain makes us make bad decisions. Fear of pain is almost as big a motivator. Now look, we still have time. I will do that biopsy if I have to, but not a moment before. Foreman takes the pills.",Start Foreman on IV antibiotics. Where's his dad?,Im not afraid of the pain.
Where are you supposed to be when your son is dying?,He's not with him.,"The cemetary, after the funeral."
He's in the chapel.,I've started your son on a new course of treatment.,I dont know where he is.
My son says you're a Manipulative bastard.,It's a pet name. I call him Dr. Bling.,You think I keep secrets from my son?
I assume you're here for a reason. What do you want from me?,When your son is in a coma you're the one who's going to have to make the medical decisions for him.,"What do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
"Oh, whatEver you decide is fine.",You don't care what I do?,Okay. Do whatever you want.
"No. I'll be your proxy, but we're not okay. You're scared, you're dying, but that's the only reason you wanna set things right. We're gonna get you better first, and then, if you still want to apologize, I'll be around. I'll call that Lawyer. She meets House on her way out.",Any improvements?,No. Youre coming with me. I cant leave you here. Ive got to save you.
No. As far as we can tell the only improvements the antibiotics are treating is the legionella. I think we need to consider alternate theories.,Like what?,Of course I do.
We do the biopsy.,Give the antibiotics more time.,Youre lucky I didnt run you over.
There is no more time the pain was almost unbearable already!,"So he's almost in unbearable pain, he's not almost dead, which means we have more time.",You have no idea how much this hurts.
Why weren't you with Foreman?,"I hang out in the basement, you rag on me. I stay in my office, you rag on me. Honky just can't buy a break.","Well, cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed youd have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit."
Do the biopsy.,Based on the cop's progression I figure he's got another four hours before,"Hey! Look, if it didnt work its because you didnt tell it right! Show me how you did it."
You figure? You're playing Russian Roulette but the gun's pointed at him.,No. Cutting open his head is what's dangerous.,I can always kind of win at roulette.
"Oh, it's dangerous. Well, what would people think? The reason you don't see Patients is because if you know them, you'll give a crap about them.",I know you,"So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?"
"He's out. The EEG shows he's still in pain, the antibiotics have had more than enough time, we're doing the brain biopsy.",Not unless you people can't come up with something clEver in the next three hours.,AND IM A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DONT HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
"Now, we're doing it now!","Well, who died and made you boss?",Stop it! Were doing this! Lets do it!
Foreman. It's legal.,He's out of his mind! Yesterday he was giggling about a hole in a guy's head.,Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque.
My son doesn't trust me how exactly is that not personal? I'm sorry.,You're sorry? You're talking about this Man's son. You're denying him the right to be a part of,"It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth."
"Yeah, you're a hero. If it wasn't for you, we'd be cutting into a dead guy's head instead of Foreman's. Sorry. Thanks.",That was great!,"Yeah, youre a real hero."
It was rude and unnecessary.,Yeah.,"Yes, very rude."
Yeah. Go away.,Give me time.,"Yeah, go away."
We're out of time.,An hour.,Theres no time.
What does out of time mean?,His O2 stats are at 94 right now. As long as they're above 90 the danger of fatal arrhythmia doesn't increase.,"It means that we can keep trying, but theres a good chance this may never happen for us."
So what? There's no point in waiting.,You were right. We should be cutting into a corpse's head.,"Hmm, thats the worst part, the waiting."
"Yeah! We should be, except the CDC has got the cop's body under",There's got to be other bodies.,"If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us."
You think this thing has killed other people?,"No, that apartment was a dump.","Well, Ive never actually been able to kill people with it."
"Foreman's already at 100% oxygen. Once his O2 stats hit 90, I can't wait any longer. Where's your suit?","Either you'll find the answer, or I'll find the answer. Doesn't matter.",They say hes only got half a tank left.
We've gotta be ready if we get the signal. 92,Found a blind bird.,Are we ready for the game?
Great. How fast can you get it in here?,"I'll know in about 30 seconds. House corners the bird, but it flies off. He then finds a dripping and rusty pipe. Again, the cell rings.","Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washedup experimental physicist."
"You better have the bird, the surgical team's in place.",I screwed up.,I dont know.
How can you not capture a blind bird?,That's not what I meant. I screwed up the first time through this place.,"I dont know, birds just dont say, Hello, sit here, eat something."
Foreman told you Everywhere he went.,"It's not where, it's when.",He knew it.
"House, I tested the water, the water's clean! As Cameron hangs up, Foreman's stats drop to 89. House climbs up a ladder and sees the water reservoir where the pigeons are drinking they have to be connected. He rings Cameron again. House.","We tested the wrong water. He stole cable, he stole fertilizer, and he stole water. looking at it under a microscope It's riddled with Naegleria.","Phoebe Sr. house, she is a real estate agent and is trying to sell a house over the phone. By the way, its still raining outside."
looking at it under a microscope It's riddled with Naegleria. I know.,You already did the biopsy?,"Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba."
We don't know.,Up and at 'em.,No one knows.
"No, I mean, I don't feel any pain.",Keep your head still and follow my finger.,"Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
Keep your head still and follow my finger. I'm okay?,"Your breath stinks, you're peeing into a bag. What are our names?",You okay? You seem a little distracted.
You did the biopsy? Cameron nods. Thank you.,Names.,"Oh, well then, yeah."
"Cameron, my dad, and the Manipulative bastard.",You remembered.,"Uhh, Rachel, my parents"
"as House is checking Foreman's reflexes Naegleria. Biopsy showed the amoeba, CDC autopsy Eventually found the amoeba, and House found it in the water in the cop's roof.",Wiggle your left toes.,"They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house."
"Wait, you went back and she did the biopsy?","Your left toes, Foreman.",Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
I just did.,"No, you didn't.",I already do.
He can't move his toes?,He can move them. Raise your right arm. Foreman raises his left. Whoops.,Can you please not do that feet first?
"He's right here, Honey, he's ok, he's right here.",Tonight. L Word marathon.,"You know, I gotta go find him."
You watch the L Word?,On mute.,You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
I'll pass. House looks confused Dinner with Cuddy.,Still sucking up so she'll fund your play space for the chemo kids? They really ought to save their energy for other things. Like crying.,Sorry. Im having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
She's the suck up. they get into the lift,She asked you?,The lobby. Penny finds a woman studying the lift.
"She's smart. She knows if she buys me enough alcohol, my defences just might be weakened.",Doesn't make sense. Unless she ran out of batteries.,"Okay. That was tricky, cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business."
"Hey, I'm recently single, she's single.",You're too nice for her to like you she's not needy enough for you to like her.,"Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me."
Chase got a case in the ER he wants us to take a look.,"Unless Chase broke his neck falling off his polo pony, he had no reason to be in the ER.","A Doctors Office, Ross is having his thing looked at by Dr."
Cuddy put him on a 2-week NICU rotation. Patient had an unexplained seizure.,"Seizures are cool to watch, boring to diagnose. What about Foreman? He needs to get his malingering butt back here.","Beth Israel Medical Center, Phoebe is at her OBGYN doing an ultrasound, Rachel is with her."
Thanks. I feel great.,"Glad you're back. Cameron makes lousy coffee. Take mine black, the way I take my brain-damaged neurologists.","One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
How are you coming along?,Tell her Everything is great. Neither of us wants to deal with her guilt.,So how are things going with you?
I don't feel guilty.,"Of course not, hell if people felt guilt Every time they accidentally lobotomised a guy...","Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him."
I was trying to save his life.,"Yeah, your heart was in the right place.",I tried to save him.
"It's true. No more left-side right-side rEversals, still some short-term memory loss and spatial processing pRoblems but trying not to be too hard on myself.","Yeah, might pull a muscle.","Yes, we think so."
Seizure that can't be explained by epilepsy. And accompanied by elevated calcium lEvels.,Still bored. Tell her why.,What is shaking?
"Because seizure with mildly elevated calcium is diagnostically simple. It's either hyper parathyroid, cancer or calcium-mediated neurotoxicity. he's puzzling over how to get the paper filter into the coffee maParkne","Well done. But until you can remember how to make coffee, hands off the Patients.","I gotta tell you guys, Im a little worried about Sheldon."
"to a nurse Lungs are clear, get an EEG, confirm that brain functions are ok.",Can we focus on the task at hand? Why did mommy twitch so hard she tossed the baby in with the bathwater?,"You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people."
You don't need me for this.,"Of course I need you, we're a team.",I dont need your help.
"Polyarteritis nodosa. Inflamed arteries in the brain cause seizures, inflamed arteries in the kidneys cause calcium build-up.",You're a moron did you Even look at the file? Kidney functions fine.,We should pack up and leave town now.
Whipple's. she makes it sound like wibbles,What?,I think its called Nibbles.
What? Whipple's.,Test her. she walks out Cameron thinks it starts with a w I'm thinking v.,I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
"Dad vomited this morning, maybe they've both got strep.",Think you can do a strep throat culture without the swab ending up in the guy's poop chute?,"Oh. Whats, whats going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dads heart? Is that a sandwich?"
V for vasoconstriction.,Gotta be my guess.,C is for suspension.
"Excess calcium makes blood vessels in the brain clamp down, best case scenario, seizure worst case, stroke.",Do a digital subtraction angiogram. Foreman can't tell up from down and Cameron's a girl - all that mechanical stuff.,"The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous."
"Sorry, Cuddy says I'm stuck here.",You're late. he's lounging on the sofa next to the door and seems to have been there for quite some time,"Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone."
And you are in my locked office. Again. she hides the box in the handbag,What you got there? Special panties for your date with Wilson?,"The apartment. Penny enters, carrying a box."
It's not a date and it's none of your business.,"It's not a date, it is business. And if it was business, you wouldn't say it was none of my business.",Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
What do you want?,I want to talk about your date with Wilson.,Look at that form.
It's not a date.,This is fun. Spring Chase from NICU and I'll shut up about your date.,But is it technically a date if the other person doesnt show up?
NICU is short-staffed.,Have you suddenly lost the ability to lie?,"Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or."
"If Chase needs a break from you, he should take it.",Absolutely.,Theres no shame in asking for a break.
I have no idea.,"So what causes seizures, hypercalcemia and the thing where mommy bends like Gumby?",I didnt think you could keep it a secret.
A little busy here.,"Oh oh, baby's lungs are going to conk out any minute. PRobably want to deal with that.","Oh, hey. No, Im not busy. Whats up?"
I'll get right on it as soon as I finish indulging my boss.,Multi-task.,Ill get right on it.
Chemical pneumonitis. Bubble bath got into the baby's lungs when he was underwater. Start him on prednisone keep him on high FIO2 to a nurse.,Let the indulging commence.,Oh my God!
And tox screen was negative.,"Lithium doesn't show on a basic tox screen, scarecrow.",It means the calibration failed.
Myelogenous meningitis could also cover Everything.,Rare complications of a rare blood cancer.,Im now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions.
"I'm not putting that baby on ECMO, the chance of there being bacteria in bathwater--","Why don't you want to work for me? I'm nice, I'm fun at parties.",You think we should have left our baby in the tub alone?
I'm not working NICU because of you. The baby's x-ray suggests a chemical pneumonitis.,Not to me. X-ray was too consolidated. So why are you down here? Hoping to expand your make out pool to include the preme to nine-year-old demographic?,"Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I cant even comfort my own baby!"
"I needed a break. From the Patients. They lie to us all the time, Foreman almost died trying to save a drug-dealing cop. I just wanted to get away from that for a while.",What a complete load of crap. What am I a nurse you're trying to prep with this vulnerability thing?,"I brought in some new faces, and one old."
ECMO could kill him.,You don't start him on ECMO and that infection could rampage through his body like pistons fans after a championship.,Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Absolutely. Cuddy's trash?,Not anymore. Paid good money for it. he finally finds the empty box that Cuddy was trying to hide that morning Look at what she bought.,"What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonards a noisy little dude in the sack."
he finally finds the empty box that Cuddy was trying to hide that morning Look at what she bought. Red clover.,"What is red clover used for, Dr Wilson?","Rachels office, shes there as Tag knocks on the door and enters carrying a plant."
"Also used to treat asthma, psoriasis, joint pain...","She doesn't wheeze, flake or ache. And she didn't ask a pulmonologist or a dermatologist for dinner. She invited an oncologist. It's not a date, it's a consult.","Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear."
"Mom's MRI was negative for masses, abscesses, there's no sign that she has myelogenous meningitis--","Fascinating, call me when we have--",Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts?
She has a subarachnoid bleed.,So why is our Patient bleeding into her brain?,Shes listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
Her blood workup shows her ProTime's elevated.,"She's bleeding because she's not clotting. So why is she not clotting? Foreman is in the room What'd you bring us, daddy?","What are you saying, that Im threatened by Alicia?"
"Hiding booze is classic alcoholic behaviour, that'd explain the bleeding. What bleeding?",You don't remember?,I didnt drink?
But tox screen was negative for alcohol.,"Hey, it was your idea. Now it's Even better. Mommy quits, she gets the DTs, it Even explains the seizure.",Correct. Youre not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
"Also fits conversion disorder. They're deep in Debt, he's working round the clock, they got a new baby - I think the seizure was a physical response to psychological stress.",Boozing mommy covers more symptoms. Put her in a nice Phenobarbital coma before the DTs kill her.,"I didnt know what else to do, hes lost all focus, every day hes got a new obsession."
Boozing mommy covers more symptoms. Put her in a nice Phenobarbital coma before the DTs kill her.,Where are you going?,Go change! She doesnt want her parents to know shes drunk.
To put her in a phenocoma.,What if I'm wrong? What if daddy's the drunk?,That I would do to her.
Do you want us to give her the pheno or not?,I want him to argue his point!,"Oh, I didnt know you wanted her too!"
I assume you considered the father and ruled him out.,What's that saying where you ASSume you become a pain in the ass to me?,"Yeah but still, I mean it shouldve been me."
Why should I argue? You'd just overrule me.,Enough! Get a pony or a watermelon farm!,"Okay, why are you arguing about this?"
Get a pony or a watermelon farm! House!,"I need him to react I need him to act like a huMan being. I need him to get over this boring, near-death rebirth.","Well, this is silly, so you dont need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in."
I have changed. It's not something you get over.,"Nearly dying changes Everything forEver. For about 2 months. 2 months is too long, I need the guy I hired back now.",Everythings changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
"No matter how much your misery loves company, it's not getting mine. I'll talk to the dad, Cameron can take the mom, we'll figure out if mom was a drinker.",Waste of time put her in a coma before the DTs kill her.,"Ross, dont let her drink anymore!"
"Turns out she and her husband met in AA, obviously she slipped. Good call.",It wasn't hard considering my other choice was your stupid psych theory.,I stumbled into a very dramatic situation.
pats House on the back You're addicted to conflict.,Did they change the name?,Hey. I dont want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole livingwithyourmom stuff on me.
"You could have handled this Patient without dragging Chase in but the fact that he didn't want in killed you. House looks into Kara's room, she's on her side facing away from the glass wall doing something Just like the fact that you can't get a rise out of me.",notices the empty baby crib at the end of Kara's bed Where's the baby?,"Bernadette, remember, your characters the healer in our group."
"notices the empty baby crib at the end of Kara's bed Where's the baby? he throws his cane away and quickly runs as well as a crippled Man can at any rate into Kara's room, Foreman hot on his heels","No breath sounds, crash cart and epi, stat! he starts giving the baby mouth-to-mouth I told you your psych theory wasn't stupid.","Joey and Rachels, Rachel enters and notices that Joey has set up a space for the baby where the couch was, complete with a crib."
She just happened to seize right in the middle of drowning her Parkld? Lucky break for the kid.,"Hey, take it easy on Foreman. He's playing with one lobe tied behind his back.",Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
"Postpartum psychosis makes her want to drown her kid, the internal conflict triggers a seizure.",You know what else might be a trigger?,Hmmmaybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
"I'll draw some blood, test for--",Ahhhh!!,When did you take my blood?
We already tested for--,Exactly! It's an insane idea!,I thought we had that looked at.
Ok. What do you want me to do?,"Have an original thought. In the meantime, stress her into having another seizure.","Oh Im, Im making this too hard."
"We can't, she's on Haloperidol.","You also can't because it's dangerous and highly unethical, therefore, if you get caught, pretend you can't make coffee, mental defectives get tons of slack.","No really, she didnt sleep well last night, so we cant wake her up."
Stop pushing him.,Stop protecting him.,"Hey honey, I dont think we should push him."
He needs it.,Not if he wants to get better.,You have someone He needs.
He might not be able to get better.,Well then I need a new neurologist.,"Uh, well Im afraid not."
He got sick doing his job.,Well if he got killed doing his job I wouldn't keep him on the payroll.,"You know, he was just doing his job."
I'm not touched.,Then you're guilt-ridden.,Im not touching you.
I'm not guilt-ridden!,Then you're pathetic!,Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism.
"Right now I'm annoyed! Keeping him up all night in a seizure lab is not the way to advance his recovery, it's too much!","You're right, should stick around, make sure he doesn't screw up.","Oh no, no, Im not going back in there."
"Oh, give it a rest.",How was dinner?,"Okay, lets take a break."
Cuddy did not mention cancer.,She lost her nerve.,No ones talking about Sonny and Cher.
It was a date.,What are you doing?,"Well, yeah, we did have a date."
What are you doing? PCR test.,"You're doing it yourself, in the middle of the night? On a spoon. Cuddy's spoon?",It will just take a second.
I'm checking her saliva for cancer markers.,Yeah. I do that after all my dates too. People think you're the nice one.,Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue?
Why are you so worried about Cuddy?,You go first. You desperately want this to be a date.,"I have to be honest with you Leonard, Im truly worried."
Because the alternative is cancer.,"Just admit that you like her. She's smart, funny, got a zesty bod. I think it's great you can look beyond the fact she's the devil.",Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
"I stole her spoon, you stole her garbage.","She's my boss. She gets sick, the hospital might replace her, especially if she dies. I'd have to learn how to Manipulate someone new.",What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. Shes a stealer.
Woah. I think I'm going to cry.,Find me when the results come in.,I think Im gonna cry!
"Muscle rigidity, involuntary grasping and sucking motions, she's in an encephalopathic delirium.",Hmm... a genuine physiological illness that rules out a few things. Like what I wonder?,Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.
Postpartum psychosis and conversion disorder.,"Thing about being a good loser, you're still a loser.","My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and Ive been in therapy ever since she accused me of breastfeeding codependently."
"The delirium means her brain is shutting down, rEverting to its most instinctual functions.","Since it's progressing, we can assume it's progressive. Which means it won't be long before the brain closes shop altogether. Ideas?",Walk out of the house.
hands the paddles back to her Another amp of epi!,Chase shouldn't be wasting his time in the NICU.,"Ok, were taking that paddle home, mister."
Could be Wernicke's.,"No, treatment for Wernicke's is thiamine we gave her that together with the vino.","Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton."
"Delirium points to lithium, I know we didn't find any but--",She had to be smuggling it in to be getting sicker.,"Hey, holdhold on, hold on, hold on, hold on."
The test could have been wrong.,"Ideas are not soda cans, recycling sucks. Give me something new and shiny. Or go retro, take an old idea, shine it up, add a new symptom... encephalopathic delirium. Pellagra.","So, I was reading how its a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class."
She drinks. Alcoholics get pellagra. They eat lousy diets so no niacin.,"He agrees with me, what a shock.","I know, I know, Im such an idiot."
Pellagra doesn't cause bloody vomit. She's still sick and getting worse.,So...,Wow! Theres a lot I didnt know about vomit. In a minute.
I should have given him more polystyrene.,"You killed him, if you don't get over it, you're going to kill momma too.",Shouldnt you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?
"You remove the drinking from the equation, internal bleeding, hypercalcemia, seizure and pellagra are all back in.","looks at Chase who is still despondent Chase, would you get your head out of the dead baby's butt and focus on the barely alive-- he suddenly realises something How","So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?"
One gram. His potassium just kept rising.,I need your son.,18 parts per million.
Who are you?,Your wife's doctor. Your son may have had the same condition she does.,I cant believe Rachel just moved on and didnt say anything to me
"My son didn't have a condition, she killed him.","If I biopsy her intestines, she'll bleed out. He obviously won't.",My gynecologist tried to kill me.
You're not using my son's body to help her.,Ok.,"You know, theres nothing wrong helping some womans kid get through their S."
So I drink. You're acting like this is my fault.,People are going to feel sorry for you they'll tell you that you can't anticipate the unthinkable well the fact is you can. It's just not all that pleasant.,"Look, when Ive been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and Im sorry."
"Look, you don't know anything about how--",I know that people don't get crazy enough to kill someone without first being crazy enough for someone to notice.,"Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing."
What is wrong with you? What kind of a person says those things now?,Let me do the test. It'll be one less thing for you to feel crappy about.,Is it a secret bank account?
Let me do the test. It'll be one less thing for you to feel crappy about.,Got a dead baby for you to autopsy.,Is that gonna be on the test?
Let Cameron do it.,Love working NICU? I can get you transferred.,"Aw, let him do it."
"I told you, I just wanted to trust Patients.",You don't give a crap about Patients.,"You said, I did warn you not the trust me."
he tries to grab it from House but House pulls it out of his reach I'm not rich.,But your dad was now he's dead. If you're not rich that means that daddy cut you out. he gives Chase the envelope,"Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?"
I'm not rich.,Don't let it change you. And do the test.,My parents are broke.
How would a baby have flattened villi?,He was being treated with polystyrene.,"Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the babys born, theyre great for shoplifting melons."
He was being treated with polystyrene. Polystyrene shouldn't--,It didn't. Question is what do they use in the NICU to bind it together?,"Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check."
Question is what do they use in the NICU to bind it together? Wheat gluten.,It's great stuff. Unless your body can't tolerate it.,That stuffs for babies.
The baby didn't have colic he had celiac disease?,Just like mom.,"Well, he didnt throw up on the baby."
"No, celiac causes nutritional deprivation. Our Patient has excess calcium.",to Wilson Tell them what causes excess calcium. With a Chaser of bloody vomit.,"Yes, and I have a theory why."
Celiac Patients are susceptible to cancer of the stomach lining. She has MALT lymphoma.,"Well, she's your Patient now. he looks back at the sheet Wilson gave him with the results of Cuddy's PCR test And it wasn't a date.","Okay, just calm down."
"Well, she's your Patient now. he looks back at the sheet Wilson gave him with the results of Cuddy's PCR test And it wasn't a date.",You don't have cancer.,"Where are we going with this, Dr."
You don't have dwarfism.,"You have no proof of that. I on the other hand, have this. he hands her the results sheet",You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
You ran a PCR on me without my consent?,"Hey, it's good news.",You went through my personal property?
Really? It's just hard to access because of this overwhelming sense of personal violation.,"Deal with it on your own time. Bad news, oestrogen is too high.","Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings."
"No matter how Many people you tell otherwise, I am and always have been a Woman. Oestrogen is normal.","Not this much, not for at least for another week. That's when you ovulate.","Okay, well, Ive been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me."
You monitor my periods? Based on when I get bitchy or...?,"Once a month, when you leave the kids cancer ward, your eyes glisten.","And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if youre menstruating."
"I was considering a donation, not a party.",So... when's our dinner? with accompanying hand gestures,"No, I realize that honey, but Im not gonna spend all of the money on one party."
So... when's our dinner? with accompanying hand gestures,Oh he's going to be so disappointed.,Were having dinner.
I killed my son.,"Is it my turn to say something obvious now? Oh I know, you were insane.",You strangled his son with your chains.
I did it. I chose to do it.,"Yeah, like diabetics choose to not produce insulin. Listen, someone got sick, someone died. Happens Every day. The only difference in this case is it wasn't the same someone.","Uh, yes you are."
I could have stopped. I didn't have to listen to those voices.,Spoken like a true sane person. This is not your fault. You're healthy now... except for the cancer.,Are you saying stop and were just too far away to hear you?
Those voices felt as real to me as Michael's hand. Right here when he nursed. And... the smell of his hair...,You do not deserve to die.,What about the fact that theyre here today?
Maybe. I don't want to live.,She said no.,I do. And yet Im doomed while you live on.
"So we get her declared unstable, appoint a medical proxy.","She was unstable, now she's sane. She's entitled to refuse treatment.","Calm down. Everythings going to be okay. We may have to kill her. Bernadette, Im putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?"

Trust me, you'll nEver know what fact may be the key to saving your life","Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!"
"Trust me, you'll nEver know what fact may be the key to saving your life Whip cweam.",I asked him if he was sure. Foreman packs up. Where're you going?,Youll never guess what I know.
You're an ass.,I know. Where're you going?,Oh my God!
Which one of you is House?,Skinny brunette.,"Oh, hi, Im Joey."
"No, that's Dr. Cameron.",I'm skinny. How do you know her name?,"No, its Michael Scott."
I was a Patient of yours.,"Oh, well, if you want to leave the chocolates downstairs Jack pulls out a gun and shoots House in the side.","Oh okay, well Im a masseuse, and I used to work at this place"
"Stay! Stay away from him. Shocking, isn't it? Who'd want to hurt you? Another shot is heard as the opening scene ends.","You're pathetic. Cameron puts down her book. Judging by the growth, I'd say I've been unconscious for two days. You've been sitting there the whole time.","Okay. Letsall right, all right. Lets talk. Please dont let him leave. Dont leave. Dont let him."
You've been sitting there the whole time. No.,"Judging by the oily buildup in your hair, I'd say you're lying.",Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
I was scared. Pardon me for caring.,Did I lose any organs?,You were scared?
"The bullet to your abdomen pierced your stomach, nicked the bowel, and lodged in the posterior rib. She pours him some water.","Well, I always say, if you're going to get shot, do it in a hospital.","Sheldon, were talking about your friends mother."
The one in your neck,I don't remember that one.,"Ahh, the one next to my foot."
"-- went right through, sEvered your jugular. The shooter turns out to be a guy who",Don't care.,"So, Ive got a gunshot wound."
You don't care why a guy walked into a hospital and shot a doctor? Shot you?,I assume his reasoning was faulty. So what was it? Infection?,I was talking like this.
The surgery went fine. You've had no post-op,Not me. Patient. Harpo.,Have you had your appendix out?
"You just got shot, House. You should rest.","I got shot. Diagnostically boring. Big fat tongue, on the other hand, endlessly entertaining.",Ive got to rest before I fall apart.
We biopsied his tongue. Shot of said biopsy.,And it was negative. And the blood tests were negative.,I didnt... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And thats when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
I didn't say we did blood tests.,You don't biopsy a tongue unless you have to biopsy a tongue and you don't have to biopsy a tongue unless you've already come up with nothing on a routine battery of tests which don't involve torturing the Patient.,"Hmm? Oh, no, no, no. Theyre from many famous people. See? Oh, like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again, I get to meet his dogs. Oh, excuse me."
"You knew the next step would be a lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture would almost certainly give us a definitive answer. Since we don't have a definitive answer, we must not have done an LP, and the most common reason not to do an LP is increased intracranial pressure. While Cameron is speaking, someone is wheeled into the spot next to House's bed because in a hospital where Every Patient gets their own room, House certainly can't!. The Patient is Jack. He was shot by Security trying to House. House takes off the wires attaParkng him to the monitor. Will you House!",I'm talking to Cuddy.,Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies.
"Lie down, you've got to be in pain!","as he's walking out with his IV Not today, today I'm on morphine.","Oh, okay, Im having another one!"
following him out You're gonna rip your stitches out.,Check Harpo's trash.,"Oh, honey, youre going to need stitches."
Forget about the Patient!,"Come on, you're curious. Trash. You don't know what I'm talking about, but you know it's good.","Yeah. Yeah, Im sorry. I dont . . . I dont really like to talk about it."
You can't just be walking around.,"Well, then, stop me.",You cant stay there forever.
You've lost blood,"Physically, stop me.",Blood of my blood
You could damage,"You can't, because that would involve touParkng me and then things would get so sexually charged Cameron physically stops him.","Well, its sharp, its metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it."
"Everything that lives, eats Everything that eats, poops that's why Every organ has a sanitation department, a lymph system. WhatEver's doing the damage is dumping its waste in there. That's what you meant by trash.",Biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.,"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, its a pile of garbage."
"Sorry, I know it's crazy, but there's no other place. The ICU stands for intensive care, he needs intensive care, so do you.",He needs to be shot again.,Its not fair!
"He is handcuffed to his bed, he is sedated, he is not gonna hurt you.",If your security was any good I wouldn't have been shot in the first place. He fiddles with the morphine drip.,A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while Im sleeping.
He is where he's supposed to be. Where you're supposed to be.,Who did my surgery?,You were exactly where you were supposed to be.
"Gillick. Why, you're going to send him a fruit basket?",He screwed up.,You have any idea what youre getting Sheldon for his birthday?
It's annoying enough dealing with your Vicodin habit. Quit upping your morphine.,I'm not. I'm reducing it.,"Oh, hey, Molly."
And you're not in pain?,I'm feeling better.,Are you sure it doesnt hurt?
Gillick is very good. Your recovery time,"My stomach kills me, my neck is thRobbing, my leg feels better.",I should go back for Gilly.
"My stomach kills me, my neck is thRobbing, my leg feels better. That's amazing.","It's unbelievable. Since getting shot is not an FDA-approved treatment for anything, it means something must have gone wrong in the surgery.",I dont know what your body feels like cause I cant touch it.
"Yes. Terribly, tragically wrong. Enjoy the mistake.","He must have nicked something in my peripheral nervous system. If it's alleviating pain, who knows what else it's doing.","Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word."
Get back to the ICU before you rip out your stitches and I have to chain you to your bed.,Why did you try to kill me?,Uhhuh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the BandAid off. What to you want to do?
Why did you try to kill me? I didn't.,Then the gun thing might have been a mistake.,You tried to kill yourself!
Are you sure you want to be doing this?,"I'm fine, I think. Cameron, you got my records?",Are you sure you wanna do this?
They don't like to release Patients' operative notes.,And yet you're holding them. And whispering.,Its the kings royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
And whispering. He's sleeping.,Yeah. Killer needs his rest. Otherwise he's grumpy all day. House bangs on Jack's bed with his cane. Hey! Wake up! Watch me save a life!,"Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?"
"Almost for sure it's some sort of infection. We've got him on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it's not Even slowing the thing down. Unless we find out what type of infection, we can't treat, and we can't figure out what type because we can't do an LP.",Do an LP. to Jack See what I did there? Couldn't have done that if you killed me.,"Oh, it was awful."
We would have done an LP two days ago if the risks hadn't so obviously outweighed the benefits. We just cut a hole in his throat. The equation has changed.,"Couldn't have put it better myself. They leave, and House is left to his notes.","Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low."
You wanna hear a story?,I have a rule. People who shoot me forfeit the right to,Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
My wife was sick. None of the doctors could figure out why.,"Oh, I know this story. She died, so you selected one of her doctors to kill because that would make Everything right again.","Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that shell feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again."
"No, she lived. You cured her.",I'm truly sorry I did that.,She died when she had me.
"In the course of investigating her illness, you convinced me that Everything was relevant. You needed the truth. I confessed to you that I had had an affair. But it turns out it had nothing to do with why she was sick. Genetic predisposition to brain aneurysms. You told her that. You also told her about my affair.",You caught crap. She left you. Now I've gotta pay because you couldn't keep your little Killer in you pants.,"She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me."
She killed herself. A long pause.,What sort of hospital has glass walls?,Did she have any last words or?
It's my husband.,Really?,Its you. Im married.
You thought I just liked watParkng people get needles poked in their back?,"No, I just figured a co-worker or sister, not wife.","Well, I thought you liked doing it."
"No, I just figured a co-worker or sister, not wife. Why?","Don't worry, it's not insulting. At least, not to you. You're satisfied with that answer?","I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife"
"You're Dr. House, aren't you?","You're not going to shoot me, are you?",Would you look at this?
"You treated a friend of mine. She told me you only talk to people if you have to, and then you insult them while showing off how insightful you are.","SEvens marry sEvens, nines marry nines, fours marry fours.",I cant believe this.
So you figure my marriage is a mathematical error.,Numbers don't lie. We're having trouble finding out what infection your husband has. The most likely culprit is an STD.,Yeah. Thats the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.
You want to know if I've had an affair with someone closer to my integer and I have to tell you the truth or my husband will die.,Is your friend single?,Come here. Tell you a secret?
What's going on? What are they doing?,"I should go. His hand is bloody, and there is blood on his Robe. I seem to have torn my stitches. He collapses on the floor.",Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?
You collapsed in the hall. Tore your stitches.,I remember. I was there.,I slipped and fell.
How's your gut? It's hurting?,You shoot the guy who sold her the gun?,"Do you have a stomach ache, too?"
She locked herself in the garage and she started the car.,You shoot the guy who sold her the garage door opener? Jack smirks. You're an ass.,"She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel."
Now that is a bold position to take given that I shot you.,The shooting just makes you an idiot. You're an ass because you're trying to wrap it in a flag like you did a good thing.,"I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster."
"You're an ass and a hypocrite. You don't beliEve in rules, you do whatEver you think is right! it's all I did. You were my role model.","Watch out, you're getting crumbs on the flag. I didn't commit to honor her, I didn't commit to nEver lie to her.","Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone?"
"Well, if you kept your mouth shut, she'd be alive and you wouldn't be shot.",If you kept your pistols in your pants,She cant shoot me.
"It's my fault she's dead! I know it. But why can't you admit it's maybe just a little bit yours, too? That maybe it's not just medical mistakes that screw things up?","Here's how life works. You either get to ask for an apology, or you get to shoot people. Not both.","Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but deaths just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going."
"Here's how life works. You either get to ask for an apology, or you get to shoot people. Not both.",Infections don't make your eyes pop out.,Why dont you just stop doing stupid things?
We should get back. You're supposed to be chained to your bed.,Not done eating. Got to be some sort of bleeding disorder.,Maybe we should get you home.
This is really stupid.,"Look, my stitches pop out again, I got three doctors to save me.","Yeah, this was a stupid idea."
You think the surgeon would have noticed a giant growth while sticking the eyeball back in.,"Tongue and eyes are sick. What about the nose? It's right in between, why isn't it sick?","Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut."
"So it's not spreading, it's got a common source.",Which can only be what?,Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
"The brain, except the CT was clean.","Check the brain's trash, see what it's hiding.",Is the WiFi working for you?
The brain doesn't have a lymph system.,"I know, all its garbage just gets caught in the snow fence by the side of the road.","Well, Im a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go."
You're referring to the blood-brain barrier.,What else? Biopsy the barrier.,"Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause."
Wouldn't it be safer to make a few eduCated guesses first? Try some relatively safe treatments?,"Biopsy the barrier, first start him on mebendazole in case it's a worm.","So, well, before making any rash"
And azithromycin for STDs.,I really don't think the wife is the kind to be messing around. If I was married to her I certainly wouldn't,"Oh, some, thats fine."
"Really, it's more helpful if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.","My body is fine. He's looking over the operation notes again. My mind, on the other hand","Cant help a friend out in a time of need, huh?"
Maybe she was a girlfriend. Maybe she was just trying to jerk you around.,"Spoke to Every nurse on that floor, the Patient only had six visitors. Two females, no babes. His mother and his aunt.","Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it."
So they missed someone. They're not Security.,My posse nEver saw her or me talking on the other side of the glass.,I can see the security guards eyes.
They were a little busy trying to save the guy's life.,"There's only one possible conclusion. It was a hallucination. What does that look like to you, a .6? He holds the chart up to Wilson.",They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
"Anesthesia? No, it's gotta be 6 smudge. Let's say you're right. It wouldn't be that uncommon after trauma, after that much blood loss.",My perceptions are compromised and my judgment is compromised. What if his wife told me that the Patient just got bit by a rabid Vietnamese leopard?,"All these people are walking around and theyre happy and their lives are just going along, ignorance is bliss."
So pull yourself off the case.,And the next case?,Get off there.
You take two weeks. You recover.,And what if I don't? What if it wasn't the shooting?,"Oh, we werent talking about you."
The guy who sees connections between Everything sees no connection between being shot and minor brain disruption?,What if it was the surgery?,You dont get it.
What if it was the fact that you tore out your stitches and lost two pints of blood?,Why did Gillick give me ketamine during my surgery?,I was not myself.
Why did Gillick give me ketamine during my surgery? Working.,We need to talk.,Because it was meant to kill me.
Get back to the ICU. Who uncuffed you?,Why would a surgeon administer ketamine?,"Well, then talk!"
Who showed you your surgical file?,How do you know it's mine?,"Depending on the depth, thats either a proctologist or a general surgeon."
Because your Patient hasn't had surgery and you don't care about anyone else.,"My anesthesia was almost non-existent, and yet I wasn't awake. For some reason, someone decided to put me in a dissociative coma instead of just putting me out.","To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed."
There are plenty of reasons to use,"Fine, I'll go beat the truth out of my surgeon.",Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
"It worked! House turns. There's a clinic in GerMany, they've been treating chronic pain by inducing comas and letting the mind basically reboot itself. There's about a fifty percent chance your pain will come back, which, of course, means there's a fifty percent chance that it won't.",You had no right!,Did it help?
To heal you?!,You messed with my brain!,Drink a healing potion.
"Why are you so upset? Are you experiencing any neurological symptoms? Dizziness, tremors, hallucinations?",No. It's a point of principle.,We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
No trash against the fence. Is your leg really better?,"Don't worry, I'm sure something else is wrong.",Im doing all right.
We did find blood.,On which side?,Blood will always tell.
The wrong side.,The first thing that makes sense.,On the left.
"It could mess with his brain, it wouldn't cause fEver. looking at Jack He's been sleeping a lot lately.","You worried? I marked a change of meds on his chart. and back to Vince Foreign object, body wants to get rid of it, causes the fEver.","Hello? No, Im just on the phone with this stupid salesman. Hes so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK."
"In the brain lining, it is. Blood dyscrasia means cancer.",Find it.,"No, its not."
All the tests,Have been negative.,"OK, now wait a minute."
We'll check the lymphatic system in the chest.,You got that from trash cans in the alley?,Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope youre ready to play doctor. Our question is about health and the human body.
The saliva glands in the tongue are connected to the lymphatic system in the lungs. It's the next lymphatic system over.,Yeah. Go get lung lymph. The team leaves.,"Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. Pass. Pass. Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat."
How did he know that?,I wouldn't have hired him if he wasn't smart.,"Oh, God, how did he know?"
"House, we need to talk to you.",How the hell did you know I was awake?,Your house has come to our aid.
Your nostrils flare when you sleep.,No they do not.,Your nostrils tell a different story.
"Fine, I'm lying.",Test was negative.,Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
Test was negative. You knew?,Force of habit.,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Surgeons found no evidence of a burst artery.,The blood had to come from somewhere. You took a shower in it.,"A hospital, Phoebe is recovering from her heart attack as Ross, Monica, and Chandler are there to comfort and support her."
You took a shower in it. Trauma?,You think someone snuck in here just to kick him in the jewels and poke out his eye and swell up his tongue?,"I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder."
"Kidneys drain into the bladder which drains into the ureter, there's no way it would mess with the scrotum.","Yeah, basic huMan anatomy.","I dont know, maybe."
Maybe he's not huMan.,"An anatomical defect would seem more likely, but let's not rule that one out.",Maybe he didnt give you a chance.
"You may have been lucky. You don't catch testicular cancer early, it kills. PRobably eroded some vessel","Yeah, yeah, I know. Question is why I didn't think of it.","I know what that means, I watch Dr."
Eyes popping out is a rather odd presentation.,"Sac blowing up, on the other hand!","I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head."
If you could think of Everything yourself you wouldn't need a team to annoy.,I screwed up some basic anatomy and I'm misconnecting a testicular explosion with a testicular pRoblem.,I dont care what you call my team.
She was trying to help you and it worked.,"Yeah, I can run like the wind, but I can't think.","Well, she really wanted to talk to you now."
You don't want a healthy leg.,"Oh, here we go.",I would want to live with no legs.
"If you've got a good life, you're healthy, you've got no reason to bitch, no reason to hate life.","Well, here's the flaw in your argument if I enjoy hating life, I don't hate life, I enjoy it.",I havent exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now its my turn some of the regular stuff.
"I didn't say it was rational. They stop walking. HIV testing is ninety-nine percent accurate, which means there are some people who test positive, who live with their own impending doom for months or years before finding out Everything's okay. Weirdly, most of them don't react with happiness, or Even anger. They get depressed, not because they wanted to die, but because they've defined themselves by their disease. Suddenly, what made them 'them' isn't real.",I don't define myself by my leg.,"Okay, you know what?"
"No, you have taken it one step further. The only way you could come to terms with your disability was to some way make it mean nothing. So you had to redefine Everything. You have dismissed anything physical, anything not coldly, calculatingly intellectual.",Why are you protecting her?,"Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about."
Because she's done nothing wrong?,You're completely comfortable with what she did to me?,Because I think she will make the world a better place.
"Yeah, I am. Yeah.",You agonize over moral choices.,"Uh, yes, I am."
You agonize over moral choices. You aren't completely comfortable with anything until you've taken days to get your head around Every possible side. I've known what she did for six hours. How come you're acting like you've known for days?,What do I have?!,"Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up."
You're not sick,What do I have?!?,"Sheldon, you are not sick."
You need to calm down,I have my brain. That's it!,"Okay, just calm down."
We were trying to help you!,"Yeah, nobody tries to screw up, they just do!",I was trying to save your life.
"You were out of control, you were shooting morphine",I can make people better! And you decide to trade that for jogging shoes!,"I dont know, II was all high."
If you're suffering from side effects then we can look at that and,"You value the physical so much, let me put this in terms you understand! He punches Wilson in the jaw.",Oh we just put her down for a nap.
"You're unbelievable. Even when you're out of your mind with anger and fear, you still couch it in logical terms. Are you hallucinating?","Yeah, I'm hallucinating!","Interesting point. Youre suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority."
"No, I mean right now. His voice starts to morph into Jack's. Are you hallucinating?",How did you know I was,Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
You were yelling at me. You were calling me Wilson.,No.,Im sorry I yelled at you.
"You're losing it, House.",I nEver called Wilson by his name.,"Please, listen to me."
"Oh, yeah, right. The hallucinator is going to tell the hallucinatee what happened.","You're not the hallucinatee, Wilson was the hallucinatee.",And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
You think maybe you're focusing on the wrong thing here?,"Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee, the bathroom was the hallucinatee.",I think you seem distracted.
Ah. Bathroom. It figures.,What figures?,Wheres your bathroom?
You wet your bed.,Damn it. He tries to hide it as the team enters. They don't notice it at all.,You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Test was negative.,No.,"Look, if you give me a chance I can, I Pam."
Efp and beta HGG say no testicular cancer.,"So, let's recap. We've just ruled out Everything, which doesn't make sense, and the answer has to be something that does make sense. Do a cystoscopy, make sure he's huMan.","Nonono, yknow what?"
Test was negative.,For him being huMan?,Is Michael in?
"Most likely scenario is some kind of bacterial prostatitis. House looks up the stairs, walks up them.",Hmm.,"Well, the stairs are fine."
He doesn't clearly have anything.,How did I get here?,It is unknown if he is armed with anything.
What are you talking about?,"I was in the ICU, and then I was coming down these stairs with you guys. What happened in between? I don't remember how I got here.","Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amys a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print."
"I was in the ICU, and then I was coming down these stairs with you guys. What happened in between? I don't remember how I got here.",I'm taking myself off my case.,Where am I?
"Your Patient's in critical care, he's had a fEver unabated for two",I think I'm losing my mind. I'm having blackouts.,Its not our fault.
You said you weren't having any,I lied.,"OK, as I was saying, right now we are having"
"If you are doing this to scare me, you made your point. Next time you get shot, I promise to only treat the bullet wounds.",I'm off the case. as he turns to leave Why did you jump up when I came in?,"Oh, man. I mean, you know, II dont want to shoot nobody."
I thought you were going to attack me again.,Again?,I thought you wanted to come here.
"Yeah, you were in my face. You were","No, I wasn't.",Yeah! In your face!
You came in here with Wilson and,That was a hallucination,I came to talk to you about Howard.
"That was a hallucination No, you",-- which means this is a hallucination.,Im sorry Rayray.
-- which means this is a hallucination.,"How can I tell what's real and what's not? Everything looks the same, sounds the same, tastes the same.",Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
Seems like I'd be the last person you'd want to ask.,"Why not? You're obviously not here. I'm obviously not here, which means this is a creation of my mind, which means I'm really just asking my mind.",The fact that youd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
"You're talking to yourself, there's a lot of unnecessary explanation.","Hey, I'm trying to work this out. That requires give and take, Even in my own mind.",I dont need to explain myself to you!
"All right, what was the question?",How can I tell what's real?,What was your question again?
Does it matter?,That doesn't sound like something I'd ask.,It doesnt matter.
"All right, your concern is that if you act in the real world based on information that's not real, the results are impossible to foresee.",With you so far.,You have no idea what people will do.
"But information is incapable of harm in and of itself. Ideas are neither good nor bad, but merely as useful as what we do with it. Only actions can cause harm.",That sounds like me.,"Pam, information is power."
"So you do nothing, you refrain from taking any actions. Continue to throw out your ideas as you always would, but if they're based on faulty assumptions your team will point that out. They won't do anything that could hurt him.",So I trust my team.,Make him shut up.
No structural abnormalities.,"Something doesn't make sense. What does that mean? It's not rhetorical. I need your input on Everything I ask, no matter how obvious it might seem.","Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so."
It means you're wrong.,"It means one of your assumptions is wrong, because if something doesn't make sense it can't be real. So what are our assumptions?","Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I dont help them set up their printer."
"We've already redone them, twice.",Let's go more basic.,Good idea. Theyll be refreshed.
What's more basic than the test results?,Tests themselves. What does a biopsy consist of?,"Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is Im grading on a curve, so youre pretty much guaranteed a C."
You take a sample,Define sample.,"Its a little tricky, you might have to."
"It's a small, representative piece of whatEver you think is the pRoblem.","You go down the shore, you fill a cup with water. It's got no fish in it. Does that mean no fish in the ocean?",You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
We can do another biopsy?,"We can fill another cup of water, but we've gotta dive in. We've gotta see what's actually in there.","Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
"Yeah, because he bled from where he wasn't supposed to bleed, causing parts of his body to blow up! Assuming that crazy assumption is correct, we operate on him, we'll kill him.",What if we could find a way of doing the surgery without giving him more than a papercut?,He did what he had to do to survive.
A person will be controlling the,People suck.,And control it how?
"If all you care about is that something's done right, pick the guy with the metal head. No way.",No way no way. You've gotta see this thing in action before you say no way. Come on. He helps Vince to sit up.,The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived.
"House, what are you doing?",Nothing.,"Oh, a blanket."
"Nothing. I'm not doing anything. Just throwing out ideas. I think you should put him in a wheelchair and take him down to the OR, but I may be out of my mind.","Relax, Cameron.",What can we do for you?
"And then he cuts off a button on her blouse, peeling part of the shirt away to rEveal her bra. House.",Does that hurt. Cameron shakes her head. Seen enough?,"Oh my God, looklook hes taking off her clothes!"
Seen enough? No.,"That wasn't a question. You either do this, or you die.",But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
You've wasted your life.,Yeah. If only I'd dediCated my life to finding someone worthy to shoot.,Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
"If I'd've killed you, would it have mattered?",Not to me. House is searParkng for a pen to write on the board with.,Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
You don't care whether you live or die?,"I care because I live. I can't care if I'm dead. He moves to the wall, dragging the bed with him because he's still chained to it.",Yeah. Nobody mind me. All Ive ever done is live to a ripe old age.
I don't want to hear seMantics.,You anti-seMantic bastard.,Dont get technical with me.
"Would anybody care that the world lost that wit? As Jack speaks, House writes on the glass board with a white marker.","Working, here.","Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?"
"That's all right, you don't have to say anything. Just let me soak into your subconscious. You think that the only truth that matters is the truth that can be measured. Good intentions don't count, what's in your heart doesn't count, caring doesn't count, that a Man's life can't be measured by how Many tears are shed when he dies. It's because you can't measure them. It's because you don't want to measure them. Doesn't mean it's not real.",looking at his makeshift whiteboard That does not make sense.,Why do you think I am so little?
"And Even if I'm wrong, you're still miserable. Did you really think that your life's purpose was to sacrifice yourself and get nothing in return? No. As Jack speaks, we see House in a car with the Woman he was speaking to earlier. The car is in a smoke-filled garage. You beliEve there is no purpose to anything. Even the lives you save you dismiss. You turn the one decent thing in your life and you taint it, strip it of all meaning. You're miserable for nothing. I don't know why you'd want to live.",I'm sorry. I know what's wrong.,What do I have to live for?
"House, get out of here! You're not sterile!",He'll be fine.,"Wait, you cant have the baby here!"
Great. What's he got?,"How come you guys have nEver tried to yank me off this case? I'm having hallucinations, blackouts.",Youre such a great friend.
"But you're always insane, and you're always right.",I'm almost always Eventually right.,And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
We've worked with you long enough to know,I know the test results Even before you enter the room. We have identical knowledge. How is that possible?,Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
How is that possible? You're wrong.,Something doesn't make sense.,"No, youre mistaken."
"House, you're losing it.",I've lost it. He starts to move his hand toward the Robot controls Chase grabs it. Why did you stop me?,"Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you."
Because I think you're going to kill him.,You don't think that.,But do you understand why I had to kill him?
"Hey, hey! This is a nightmare, you're gonna wake up. It's real, you're killing a Man!","It's also possible I may already be dead, but I don't beliEve in the afterlife.","Sweetie, every night you dont kill him in his sleep, he wins."
"House, go back to your room. If this is a hallucination, it's a good one you're pain free, you can walk","This is not real, therefore it's meaningless.","So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room."
"Once in the abdomen, once in the neck.",Hello.,Thats three times in ten minutes.
It's going to be okay. You're going to be okay.,You don't know that. Tell Cuddy I want ketamine.,Its going to be alright.
You ran here?,It's just... 8 miles.,"I dont even run there, I drive."
Why did you...? Holding the bottle of water.,Why does a dog lick its He takes the water from her hand and starts to drink it. Yes he's just drinking her water. workplace acceptable euphemism for testicles?,You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive preshow urination.
Because he can.,What have you got for me boss?,Because thats all it takes.
I thought you said you needed 8 weeks of rehab. You should have been back here,He puts down the water and picks up a file.,Im gonna go tell Joey that that youre back.
You're completely pain free? The ketamine treatment can wear off.,It's been 2 months. It's not wearing off. What have you got for me? He picks up one of the files and starts looking through it himself.,Excellent! Its in a culdesac. We can box him in.
It can take as long as--,Why are we having this discussion?,Actually about an hour and a half.
Middle-aged Man had hair transplant about 2 months ago--,"Infection throwing clots, you're an idiot.","Ok, nobody panic."
"Girl was doing an inverted yoga pose, neck snapped, paralyzed from the neck down except the x-rays show no evidence of spinal injury. And she's cute.","Oh, well played sir! He grabs the file off Cuddy but continues to read the one in his hands. What about Stephen Hawking trying to do the 500 butterfly?",The tires look pretty worn.
"Forget it - brain cancer, brain surgery - there's nothing left to diagnose. I would take the other one.",Hmm... I'll take them both.,"Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?"
You don't think he had brain cancer?,Of course he had brain cancer Even oncologists don't screw up for 8 years.,Did he? Havent heard that story before.
So if there's no diagnostic issue why are you taking the case?,Treatment can be interesting.,Because youve solved zero cases.
Not to you.,I've changed.,But not to us.
"No, you haven't.","No, I haven't.",Of course I havent.
Then why are you taking the case?,Guy tried to kill himself.,How is this a fair trial?
"The guy had cancer, he's a lump he hasn't been able to touch his wife, speak to his kids.","He's been in that chair for 8 years, his muscles have atrophied. Maybe I can help him with the pain. Isn't that enough of a reason to want to help?","Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nineteen blocks."
Not for you.,I've changed.,For you maybe.
No you haven't.,Then why am I taking this case? He suddenly sprints ahead of Wilson and runs off.,Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
Then why am I taking this case? He suddenly sprints ahead of Wilson and runs off.,Let's start with the cute paraplegic.,Why are you taking his side?
You look... Healthy.,"Quad with no broken neck, struck me as odd.",Totally and completely healthy!
Uhh... you could take a whole 2 minutes to ease into being back.,"Taken a whole month to ease back, 8 weeks is the maximum rehab time for a gunshot wound to the stomach and neck.",You said to hold it for you until you came back.
We heard they nEver found the guy. There's no new leads?,What? You think he might have shot this Patient too? Would explain her symptoms!,"Were never going to find those leads, are we?"
Could be MS.,See? It's not so difficult.,Who else might it be?
See? It's not so difficult.,"It's not MS. She had no symptoms before she climbed on to her head. Unless she's been upside-down for the last 10 years, MS ain't it.","Well, if you think its so easy, Gabe, why dont you try it?"
The leg looks fine. You totally pain free?,When did this turn into 'what did you do over your summer vacation'?,"Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?"
I asked Cuddy to replace the carpet.,"No, I like the carpet. What did you do over the summer?",And we have torn up the carpet!
What did you do over the summer? Enthusiastically. I--,Re-do the tests.,How was my summer?
You don't think that's from the pool he drank?,"Give him an O2 mask. His leg muscles have atrophied, tendons have shortened from disuse causing intense pain. Tendon surgery will make him more comfortable.","Thats racist! I dont know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim."
Comfortable? Raised eyebrows from the Ducklings.,Scoot.,"You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?"
Thanks for being here.,Not a pRoblem.,Thanks for coming in.
My dad wouldn't kill himself.,You haven't spoken to him in over 6 years.,I cant kill my own father.
He wouldn't kill himself.,Fine. I'm wrong. You obviously have a better understanding of this Man who drools in front of your TV set 24 hours a day.,Yeah. Its a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.
"Look, he must have been confused. It must have been an accident.",Hope it was a suicide attempt.,It was an accident.
We were doing the EMG but we nEver got past the insertion of the conduction pin. Did she just say thank you?,I loaned her some money. What went wrong?,She didnt need to bother you.
Nothing went wrong.,Nothing went wrong then something went right.,"Oh, everything went great."
You're not going to tell me why she thanked you?,You're not going to tell me what went right?,I just want to thank her for
You did something for which she is grateful and you're... embarrassed?,"For you. Saw you coming up, thought you were a 14-yr-old boy, I set her straight.","Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?"
"I'm not telling you what went wrong - or right, until you tell me why she said thank you. She stands with hands on hips.","Ohhh, you got me.","She said, Thank you."
It's either that or a reflex response.,What happened?,"Well, its like that science thing."
"Ok, this is Dr. House. House, this is Caren--","Pleasure's all mine, what happened?","Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I cant remember why I came over here. Ha, ha."
"When we inserted the conduction pin, she flinched.",To Cameron as she walks in. She flinched! Did you hear?,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
Does that mean I'm getting better?,How big is a flinch? Bigger than a twitch? Smaller than a spasm? Chase inserts the pin again so House can see the flinch. You smoke?,"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and"
"Socially, a lot.",You do yoga and you smoke?,A little bit.
I know it's hypocritical but--,"Not at all, the world sees your legs, no one's checking out your lungs. He goes and checks out Caren's handbag.","I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy."
How would smoking cause--,"It wouldn't, just needed a lighter.","Im smoking. Im smoking, Im smoking."
House! My god!,Gives the puppy dog eyes. The case was looking so promising.,I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house!
"Hey, I'm not faking.","You moved, therefore you can move. Get this lunatic out of here before she bores again.",Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasnt faking.
"I heard you were watParkng surgery with a Patient's family. Talking to a Patient's family. It's because of your hallucination, isn't it? After you were shot? You chose life you decided you wanted meaning, so you took a case with no mystery. Something any doctor could do. A case with no upside except the satisfaction of helping another huMan being.",She thanked me.,You dont seem to understand.
And... you felt nothing.,Wasn't Even sure what I was supposed to feel.,I didnt feel anything.
"Sorry, need you, again.",Told you to get rid of her.,"Ok, thanks. Sorry, again"
"It's a good thing we didn't. Tightness in her chest, she can't breathe, it could be pleural effusion.",Right. Either that or she's holding her breath like a 4-yr-old.,"I dont know what that is, Pam."
Right. Either that or she's holding her breath like a 4-yr-old.,Relax.,Having a little trouble catching your breath there?
We should give her a local.,That would defeat the point of me being nasty.,Should we do something for her?
But she can't breathe if she's down.,Down!,"Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up."
She can't breathe--,Down!,I said breathe!
PRoblem's in her heart.,Can't fake that.,Your big problem is me telling her.
Or vasculitis would also explain the effusion.,But not the paralysis. Let's assume that she wasn't faking it.,"You know, if I had a week off, Id go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert."
"She moved, therefore she could move. She wasn't paralyzed.",Ehh...,You cant move.
"And she's been scanned up and down, it's all clean.","So, open her up, and find it. He bounces the ball he normally plays with on Chase's head - to Chase's annoyance.","Long story short, shes on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone."
So what do you want us to do? Start at her neck and just keep cutting down her spine until we stumble on something?,That should work. He tosses the ball back to Chase before walking out the door.,She was reaching for this ax when you got to her.
That should work. He tosses the ball back to Chase before walking out the door.,His heart rate's a little high.,Bring him back inside at once.
Should I be worried?,PRobably just means he's still in discomfort from the surgery. I'm going to up his morphine a little.,"take a few breaths, and then I ask myself Is this worth freaking out about?"
You've been so nice to us.,That's the job.,"Youve been good to me, my lord."
"No, I mean all the other doctors, all they did was obsess on the... the cancer, the treatment, the damage... just trying to fix him. You're the first doctor that's Ever given a damn about the quality of his life.","His heart rate's come down, the morphine worked I was right.","No... you know what Jim, this isnt about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him."
What a touParkng moment. That's why we become doctors. For those rare moments when our hearts are warm--,Would you like to get a drink?,I am about to give blood.
Are you serious or are you just trying to change the subject?,"No, I'm serious.","Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?"
"No, I... it's just... you're just coming off the surgery and you're not yourself yet and I work for you and Even though last year's... Frustrated sigh as House starts smiling smugly. you're smiling! I'm saying no and you're smiling!","Oh, don't take it personally.",Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didnt come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.
You've been back at work 24 hours and you're already playing hide and seek in a Woman's spine.,Who won the pool?,"Actually, shes on an HR retreat for the next three days."
"There's no tumor. Her platelets are normal, scans--",What's the worst that can happen? I paralyze her. She won't Even notice.,Youve never snooped around my apartment?
Her Lawyers might. You're not doing the surgery. And lower the morphine on your other Patient.,"Sits down in the chair opposite Cuddy. Fine, I'll lower it. If you'll let me do the surgery.","Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain youre causing her right now?"
What? You want a trade? We're not swapping a couple of goats for your help putting up a barn.,"You want something, I want something. We compromise. It's the grown-up way to resolve our differences.",Of course I am not interested in goats.
You tried to swap?,"Ran a few more tests, came back negative, surgery's on.",Do you want to switch?
"You really don't give a crap, do you?",Does that make me evil?,"No, I actually dont."
Does that make me evil? Yeah.,"The girl's life is at stake, what we're talking about with the guy--","No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?"
What we're talking about is the reason you took the case to help someone.,Too bad for them.,"Yes. My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault. Tell Meredith I said it another time ."
The fifth lEvel of happiness involves creation. Changing lives.,Sixth lEvel is heroin sEventh lEvel is you going away.,"You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy."
"House, you're not--",I'm not an idiot. To nurse. Move.,Im Arya Stark.
"House, leave her alone.","Close her up, you wanna know why?",Give her a key to your apartment.
The room's no longer sterile.,"True, it's not the most interesting reason.","Okay, there are no stupid fights!"
What the hell has that got to do with--,Told you it was interesting it gets Even better.,And what does that have to do with flags?
"The uh... nurse changed his morphine, I thought you were worried about--",It's just post-op discomfort. He's ready to go home.,"Oh, is this about youyou dating the nurse?"
So he won't have any pain?,Eventually.,Are you sure this wont hurt?
Eventually. Thank you.,Everything else will be the same.,You have to get to it eventually.
"Well, you took away his pain and that, that changes a lot.",Why don't you put him in some sort of... facility? Some place without a pool.,That was a nice ax you made for him.
"Yeah. I could dump him there, except he's my husband. He's my son's father.",Right. Kids need a dad someone to play catch with. Talk about girls.,I really do understand how hard its gotta be to leave your child with another person.
Mark's learned that you don't have to abandon someone just because--,Get a dog.,"Yeah, but its okay, because when Ross left Mark came over."
I'm taking care of him for the same reason you helped us.,Some guy shot you and you hallucinated?,Why did you help us?
I have a responsibility.,"So he's just an anchor weighing you and your family down, sapping your energy, wasting your life - that's the meaning you take from this?","Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?"
I want to take care of him.,You enjoy this?,What do you mean to do with him?
I can't abandon him.,"So you don't want to take care of him. Taking care of him doesn't fulfill you, make you happy. But not taking care of him would make you miserable.",He shouldnt have entered the mle if he didnt know how to fight.
"I don't need your help, I've done this a million times.","Here, let me...","I promise you, you dont have to do this for me."
"Here, let me...","Do that again, make that sound.",Here. Let me.
What was that?,That... was talking.,Save him and l will free you.
That... was talking.,You guys are lousy doctors. You're in such a rush to make the Patient feel better you forgot to check what was wrong.,"So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about."
"Yoga girl walked out of here 2 hours ago, you fixed her.","Not her, the other guy.",Its my fault.
He had brain cancer they removed it 8 years ago. His condition's been the same Ever since.,"Until last night, he spoke.","Mmm. No big deal, I enjoy spending time with you."
What'd he say?,Guhhhhhhh.,Were wedged between the copier and the railing.
You want us to dissect 8 years of medical history with grunting in the differential?,Sounds good. Call me when you're done.,IIts just so insulting!
You're fabricating a mystery because you're bored.,I am not bored.,"I dont think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing."
You didn't tell the wife it was only a grunt?,"Of course not, because then she would nEver have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests. I don't remember you being this bitchy.",Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
"The Vicodin dulled it, in the sober light of day I'm a buzz kill. You're giving false hope to a family that's been wrecked. Don't torture them, let it go, tell the wife it was only a grunt, tell her to go home.","Can't let her down like that, pumped her up with too much false hope.","Rest easy, son, youve had a busy day."
"In 8 years the Patient experienced 214 symptoms, Many of them repeating.",Any patterns?,"She grows any more hair on her face, yes."
"If you add pain into the mix, fEver, frequent urination could indiCate a kidney pRoblem.",I like it.,"Mr. Tribbiani, Im afraid youve got kidney stones."
"No, creatinine and BUN were both normal.","Not the kidney part, the pain part. Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal a pancreatic cyst.","Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!"
"Perfect, you Managed to pick the one symptom he nEver had. Abdominal pain.",It's the first symptom on the board. Grunt.,He used to fight dogs.
Grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain.,"No, traditional diagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm, vibration of the larynx leading to the audible sound 'I have a pain in my abdomen'.","Look, Im telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesnt hurt that bad."
Richard's symptoms are culled from 8 years of medical history. They're not patterned. These are random individual Events over time.,Illnesses have incubation periods. Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.,"I dont serve your brother, Your Grace."
"His throat will collapse, muscle degeneration in his neck won't tolerate the scope, it's an automatic trach!",You're talking about him like he's an invalid.,Nothing to worry about.
"Yeah, we're insensitive.","Does he drool? Can he hold his neck straight? Does he choke on his food? His neck's fine, his throat's not going to collapse. Cameron, get consent from the wife.","Im sorry! Heyhey Joe, why dont you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!"
"We trached him, endoscopically removed the pRobe and he's breathing again. So, all in all, great idea.",Get a look at the pancreas before the world ended?,"Sheldon, its a routine procedure, Ive heard you complain about his snoring."
"Which means barring anything else, meaning you, he can go home tomorrow.",This Man nearly died. How can you discharge him?,I think that I should help him get home.
"You stick something down someone's throat, they gag, spasm, which he did. It took us a half an hour to get that thing out.",Except that our Patient's throat was sedated.,Open your mouth.
Stop it. She stands up and stands in his way so he can't skateboard past her. You're enjoying this.,I find it interesting.,"Look at that, look at that, see how shes pushing him away and he wont budge."
It's interesting only if you're right if you're wrong we're torturing this guy to amuse you.,Turns to Foreman. Half hour to remove the pRobe? Foreman nods.,"Hey, hey, its as interesting as a morgue."
Foreman nods. House.,It's not a spasm.,Todd Zarneckis house.
"There are no lesions on his brain, nothing to interrupt the new orders.",All it takes is one wire down.,"Oh, spoiler alert."
You have no evidence of any wires down.,"A few micro-tumors on the meninges, suddenly you're choking to death.",The transfer circuits are working.
He will bleed into his brain!,"No, he won't.",Hes gonna ruin everything.
Because that wouldn't be interesting. You can get permission this time.,The brain is enclosed in a sac called the meninges--,I didnt ask for your permission.
Does this mean that the cancer's back?,"No, no, no, no.",This is not a sign!
"No, no, no, no.","If we found cancer, it wouldn't be the original cancer. It'd be new.",But you dont even understand its symbolism.
"So what, more surgery? More radiation?",Might not be the worst thing. If this isn't just ancient history then maybe it's something we can correct. Might Even get some brain function back.,"So, well be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here."
He could get better? No!,But understanding what you're saying would be nice. Maybe you can figure out ways to communiCate.,"No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think hes doing any better than he was this morning?"
You're lucky he didn't die.,I'm lucky? He's the one who didn't die.,Im glad youre not dead.
We told you he'd hemorrhage.,"Told me he'd bleed into his brain, not out of his ear.",I told you that would happen.
You've got to drop this.,We're missing something.,Just drop it.
"We did a dangerous test and something bad happened, that's all this is.","Gets off the stool and starts looking at the scans up close. Give me a tour of the brain, Foreman. Walk me through the scans. 1998, what happened?","Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but yknow, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal."
5 cm grade 4 astrocytoma between the parietal--,"Nothing. Next, a speck on the superior temporal region.",My head You dont even wanna know whats going on in
"It's a regrowth, benign.",Star thingy next to the Rathke cleft.,"Its a sore spot, dont bring it up."
"House Every speck is not a suspect, its years of surgeons digging around in his head. Let him go.",Re-do Every blood test he's Ever had. Re-scan his head.,Im not going to rat on him.
"No. House turns around to look at her. He's been sick and suffering for 8 years, I'm not going to help you make it worse I'm not going to help you make it interesting.","That's ok, Foreman's better at that stuff than you are. We need 5mm cuts through the occipital and hypothalamic regions.","Sheldon, you are a grown man, havent you ever been sick before?"
"How Many millimeters? House looks at Cameron like, 'this is why he's bee around longer than anyone else.'",I can help him.,"All right, ten centimeters, here we go."
That's it? That's your argument?,Seems like a good one.,And theres my talking point.
"If I thought for a second you wanted to help him, you'd have carte blanche. You're doing this because it's fun.",Does nobody in this hospital have anything better to talk about than my motives? My motives have nothing to do with the case.,"No, No. Dont help him. He doesnt need help, Pam. What a nice guy."
Your motives have Everything to do with your judgment.,"For the first time in years I've got no opiates in my body, now you question my judgment.","So your reasons are true, and theirs are false."
"24 times a year you come storming into my office spouting that you can help someone. Only you nEver say those words, you say something like his pancreas is going to explode because his brain is on fire! You come here with medicine, not with platitudes.",I didn't want to bore you with the details.,Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional.
The answer's no. Cuddy called 30 seconds after you left and said you'd try an end around.,My leg hurt.,"Uh Rachel has left the building, can you call back?"
Looks up suddenly. How bad?,Enough that I'm telling you.,Dont look up.
Did it go away?,Ached for a while. First time I felt anything there since the surgery.,"Okay, did you get it out of your system."
But it went away?,"It was muscular, it was some cramping. Wilson smiles. What are you smiling about?","Well, it still has to go, right?"
"You're 40 something years old, you've been running God knows how Many miles a day, fallen a hundred times off that skateboard and you're shocked to have some soreness?",Just give me a prescription.,I cant believe youre sore.
"For Vicodin? House, people get aParkng joints, cramps, they put on an ice pack, they take some ibuprofen.",I know what the pangs of middle age feel like.,Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room?
"No, you don't, because you've been stuffing vicodin Every 5 minutes since you turned middle age.",The surgery didn't work.,"Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy."
Don't play me.,You think this is a scam?,Im not playing with you.
"I think you want me to feel sorry for you and either do the end around on Cuddy or give you the drugs. He takes his pad of prescription slips and puts it away in a drawer under his desk deliberately to make his point. Either way, you get the high you think you need. House resignedly is about to leave the room. House, your surgery worked, you're fine. It's just going to take time for it to feel good.",Whispered. Come on. He gestures for her to open her window so he can talk to her.,"No, Ill think about it."
Whispered. Come on. He gestures for her to open her window so he can talk to her.,"Circumventricular system sends his cytokines, releasing the early stages of the immune response but CDOS releases prostaglandins that reset the hypothalamic set point upward, unless it's countered by antipyretic therapy.","Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy."
And you discovered this when you stepped into the university pool? She fetches him a towel and hands it through the window.,Fountain. I can cure him.,"Elizabeths Dorm Room, Ross is walking up to her door and knocks on it."
"Cure him? Even if the fountain proved anything, fixing hypothalamic dysregulation isn't going to regenerate brain.","No, but if the scar tissue on his hypothalamus is resting against the pituitary, the adrenals would shut down. Addison's disease.","This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?"
"You didn't see any scar tissue on his MRI, his CT scan--",His brain is functional.,Thats where you got your scar?
His temperature's normal. There is nothing wrong with his hypothalamus or his pituitary!,I can make him walk! I can make him talk!,"Okay, well, he might like that, Ive seen him chilly."
This is a wild guess! That came to you because you were! sweating.,Inject him with cortisol.,"Well, youreyoure sweating."
She nods. You're high.,"I told you, I haven't had anything in 3 months.",You know what Id love to do?
This is as high as you get. A theory that ties your case up in a neat little bow but you don't have a lick of substantiating proof.,Sighs.,"Its actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it."
He's on his way out of here. Figure you'd be on your scooter racing down the halls to stab the Patient in the neck with cortisol.,She was right to say no. I had no objective reason to think that I was right. Just needed the puzzle.,"Stay low... This is it... There he is. Hes been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Lets roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know whats going on here. You werent sick at all."
Ah. Where's the sweat and the B.O? You've taken such pride bathing us in your personal musk.,Showered at home.,I cant say I care too much for that smell youve brought in with you.
And yet you're earlier than usual.,"Is this an intervention? It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore. I am, howEver, still hooked on phonics.",Arent we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?
If you still did your morning run and showered at home you'd be later than usual.,Thought of you in the shower.,"Okay, well since Im obviously being ignored here, lets go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 720, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly."
How's your leg? You seem to be favoring your left side.,I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday. Makes all the difference in the world. Gets into the elevator.,I really like to say that Imum Yknow what Id really like to say?
You've taken the stairs Every day.,Do I need a restraining order?,"Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs."
"Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy. Had all his vaccinations, fractured his right ulna at age three, Parkcken pox at age five","He Ever get his feelings hurt? I'll need to know that, too.",Dont tell me youre worried about a child halfway across the world.
Maybe we should talk to the kid.,"Why, in case he's telling the truth? You're a beliEver, aren't you?","I dont get it, I mean, you just got him."
"Well, I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy, and 10 million billion planets in the universe that we're the only ones with life.",No. But I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our back doors.,We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy.
There is new research indicating a link between neurological pRoblems and bleeding disorders.,Perfect. Especially if there were neurological pRoblems.,So are things with you and Joey any better?
What part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?,"Well, why is that a hallucination?","Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens."
What? You think the kid,He's having nightmares.,"The kid...? Excuse me, uh, thats, thats my puck."
"His alien abduction story! the lEvel of detail is... I don't know where he gets it from. The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books",Great! You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?,What?! I thought hed love it! His favorite kids book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.,So it's a simple bleeding disorder.,"Okay, why are you here?"
"No, blood tests were all normal. And he clotted in six minutes.",So it's a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.,Yes. My sisters uterus came down with a baby.
I didn't screw up the test!,"So it's a UFO, unidentified flowing orifice.",But you didnt fail.
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.,You sure?,"Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you."
Had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.,So you're saying Chase did screw up.,"Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way."
Big hand points to minutes. Maybe you got them mixed up?,"Oh, snap! Foreman's playing the dozens you're at a cultural disadvantage here. Take a few minutes to think up a witty retort.","Uhhuh. Im guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too."
So we have contradicting bleeding time tests. If we run labs to check his clotting factors we can confirm which one's right.,"Yeah, testing, nice idea. Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent. Much better than the paperwork, too.","Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking?"
House! Clancy's gone missing.,"Oh, no!","Marc oh, this is ridiculous!"
"Clancy, stop! There is no Parkp! We're going to clean you up, and we're going to go back to your room. You can't do things like this. Your parents! Chase stops, because he sees something shiny through the blood.",Results came back. The lab cannot identify the metal. They said it might not Even be terrestrial.,"Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, hes charging his plasma rifle."
They said it might not Even be terrestrial. Really?,"No, you idiot! It's titanium. Like from a surgical pin, like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago, nice medical history.","You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other lifeforms would probably not end well for us."
That pin was removed six months after,"So what, a little piece broke off during removal.","Uh, you have to take the pin out."
"Titanium is used to build nuclear subs, pieces don't just break off.",Tell that to the guys on the Kursk.,"And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula."
"To his lungs, maybe. Not his neck.",Yeah. An alien Parkp makes more sense. The real mystery is you didn't actually screw up. He stumbles.,In the lab?
He stumbles. You okay?,"Fine. I tripped. Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck, apparently didn't bleed to death. Now that's weird.","Just going to walk over here whoa, whoa, Im slipping and falling!"
He clotted on his own?,"Sure did. So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there's not again.","Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?"
Or Foreman screwed up. Two out of three tests agree with my findings.,"Lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.",You tampered with my experiment?
"He's in ICU, systolic is hovering around 170, I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.","Tradeoff being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke, MI, and blindness.","I have no idea whats going on, but I am excited!"
I'm open to suggestions.,Solve the case. Kidneys could,Ill just throw out some suggestions.
Kidneys are clean. They enter the lab.,Fingers crossed. Tell me he's a mutant huMan hybrid.,"Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis."
Right. Kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.,"She was being metaphorical. Trying to sound like me. I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking.","If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar."
"I meant, he's clotting right now and he's in hypertensive crisis. Maybe the two are related. What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?",Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors. Even someone low on von Willenbrand's could theoretically clot.,"Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history."
And the first time Clancy clotted he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction he could have easily have been hypertensive.,I know I get worked up when I cut microParkp tracking implants out of my neck.,But the mission wouldnt be for at least a year.
Sounds like a cheat to me.,"Yeah, we get it. Okay, what's the differential for a sEven-year-old boy suffering multiple hypertensive crises?","I I dont believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust."
"It's clean, his heart isn't the pRoblem.",Why don't I have hi-def in my office? I'm a department head!,"Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you dont have to do that! Im happy for him! I am! I reallyImIm happIll work on it."
Valves are intact.,Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.,"Look, I was going over the schematics on my zeroG toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve."
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.,"See, this is what I'm talking about. Foreman, you've got to steal this thing for me.","Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amys lab."
"The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears. The pRoblem's got to be somewhere else.",We're gonna need a bigger boat.,"Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing."
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?,There.,"No, but he will."
There. Where?,Right there.,"So, where is it?"
We don't have a laser pointer.,"Well, why not?","Hey, I want to see this laser thing."
So you found an arrhythmia.,"That's not an arrhythmia, that's a no-rhythmia. Myocytes contract, these aren't moving at all. Go get me those myocytes I want to talk to them in my office.","When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee."
How's the kid doing?,Heart nearly exploded.,Shelly! Hows my baby doing?
What's going on with the leg?,"First, tell me what's going on with the boobs.","Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
If you're feeling pain,They're firmer.,"OK, where does it hurt?"
It's called an underwire. I want to get a PET scan of your brain.,I think it's hormones.,"Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it."
As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus,Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.,"You know, I might be able to help you with this."
"-- Then the pain can be good. It could be muscle regenerating. After you work out, you get sore. Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.",Guess I should be saying 'mazel tov.' Who gets to pass out the cigars?,I wish wed started this exercise six months ago.
I'm not pregnant. I need to get a PET scan of your brain.,Boy or girl? You got a name picked out?,Guys! Im not pregnant.
I'm not pregnant!,My leg doesn't hurt.,"Oh god, I have to tell you something."
You're in denial!,"No, I'm not! Oh, you got me. If I thought my leg was deteriorating, don't you think I'd want to take steps to prEvent that?",and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Sighs. Okay. House's beeper beeps.,"Gotta go. As he leaves, he fake stumbles. Cuddy helps him up He gives her a look with a ha.","Oh, okay. Well, Ill just leave the door open and go sit on the couch."
"Here's Clancy's DNA, and here's the DNA from the piece of that heart we just biopsied. They don't match.",That is impossible. Run it again.,"Um, doesnt Adam count as Leonard Nimoys DNA?"
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body. Alien DNA.,Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?,"Still, Id like to know the details."
There are ways DNA could become mutated. Extreme UV radiation.,"That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.",Its my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.,"So first Daddy was a rapist, now he's a chemist.",A lot of other gas smells
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.,"Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia, or both.","Dont let any of those things get away, Morty."
Is your leg hurting?,Is that question helping?,Are you hurt?
Is that question helping? You're leaning.,You're sitting.,Im leaning. This is where I lean.
You're sitting. You're evading.,"My head's hurting. Please, someone give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA.",Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
What if we find the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?,Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?,"Thats not necessary, its like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone."
"It's the same way we search for cancer. The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells. We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein and we flush it throughout his system, and the similar cells light up like light bulbs.","Okay, let's do that.",So how do you search?
You want to go for a run?,What do you want?,"So, you feel like goin for a run?"
I want you to run. He throws House a bottle of Vicodin.,When did you become an enabler?,Youd better run!
"I'm enabling you to exercise. Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab, muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.",I'd rather not become dependant on pain pills to get through my day. He throws them back.,"You know, thats probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast."
You're just like any other Patient running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.,I'm as happy as a pig in poop.,But I havent been counseled.
You're scared the ketamine treatment's wearing off. That it was just a tortuous window of the good life.,What part of poop didn't you understand?,"I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world."
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?,It's my leg. We've known each other a long time.,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test."
We didn't miss anything. Brain scan was completely clean.,Our tag must not have penetrated the blood-brain barrier. Don't use an IV this time get it right into the brain.,"Yeah, Ive been to these places before, but Ive never really seen them, you know."
"His scan was clean, twice! It's not there! House sits making them pause.",What if it is there but didn't show up on the scan?,"Wait, theres something dead ahead on the scanner."
Where are we going?,I am going to think.,"Hey, Michael."
I am going to think.,Send the kid home.,What are you thinking?
What do you mean?,Make sure his blood pressure's stabilized and send him home.,Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.
Like nothing Ever happened?,"We cured his bleeding disorder, removed all the damaged cells we could find.",I just dont understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
"We don't know that we fixed anything, it's only been a day. Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.",It's more pRobable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.,"Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?"
He had a convulsion.,"May be epilepsy, may be psychological, may be nothing.",You were trembling like a leaf.
House! You're just giving up on this kid?,You've got to know when to stop.,"Oh, thats it."
"You don't stop, you nEver stop, you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.",Except on my last case.,You have to stop.
Don't be pathetic. Just forget the last case. This kid obviously has something wrong with him.,"When did you dEvelop such strong opinions about my Patients? Last week you were convinced that my Patient wasn't sick, now you're convinced this one is.","Oh, honey, youre going to need stitches."
"This one is a young boy. His parents are desperate. Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours","Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg. That's where we found most of it. Maybe we could just remove his affected eye completely.","You might want to consider changing teams, because we wouldwe would love to have you."
If you have reason to beliEve that that might help,"I'm not going to start lopping off body parts, but it's interesting that you'd give me the green light.","If it helps, Im questioning your life choices, too."
I just want you to do something.,You've been overly supportive this entire week. Either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden. And it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.,"Oh, youre losin your apron here, let me get it."
I'm not pregnant.,Then what did you do wrong?,Youre not having sex.
"He had Addison's, your last Patient. You were right. I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.","To Cuddy's belly. Oh, your mommy's in such trouble. She's such a liar! That's why you don't have a daddy. That's why she had to And! epiphany.","No hes, hes alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room."
"To Cuddy's belly. Oh, your mommy's in such trouble. She's such a liar! That's why you don't have a daddy. That's why she had to And! epiphany.",How does one person end up with two different sets of DNA?,"Mrs. Cooper, hey, its Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother."
We've been through this.,Our assumptions are faulty.,We have gone through this.
"We've confirmed two different sets of DNA, we re-ran the sequence.","I didn't say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty. We assumed he's a person.","Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones weve already collected, well know what it is that we found."
"Of course, the aliens didn't just visit him, they replaced him.","Well, you're being silly. What if he's not a person, what if he's two persons?","Yeah, but thats just his Earth parents."
I'm not getting the metaphor.,"No metaphor. Chase, you said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?","Guys, I dont like this analogy."
"Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.","The kid was right all along, he was implanted with something.",I was their first born!
But he doesn't have a twin.,Not walking around.,He looks like your twin.
"Not walking around. But in vitro fertilization costs about 25 grand a pop. CGI of! well, cells merging. So doctors implant about two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth. PRoblem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all of the kiddies. Two brothers get stuck sharing, there's no bunk beds, so they cuddle up to keep warm. They nEver untangle. He's two people in one. It's called Parkmerism.","Unfortunately, his brother's like a bad doubles partner.","Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?"
"So does that mean you can find the bad cells in his brain, or not?","Sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine. Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks. If we induce an alien abduction",Its clearly not an accounting mistake.
"Wait, what the hell are you talking about?",The foreign DNA has got to be in a portion of your son's brain that makes him beliEve that he's being abducted.,"Yeah, well you didnt know that when you filled out this payroll form."
You're talking about brain surgery.,"I'm talking about really cool brain surgery. One of your sons will die, but the taller one won't be so annoying any more.",Andand theres no danger to her and the baby?
What's on the card? Light bulb.,"Start us out at ten. House is doing the brain surgery. Wait, what? Clancy's arm twitches.","Wait, is this your card or isnt it?"
I'm not doing that.,"That was all me, kid. Sorry.",Im not doing that either.
Brain waves indiCate mild hallucination. Neurons lighting up.,Any dark spots?,Yes. I dont care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.
Area's too fuzzy. Hallucination isn't strong enough.,"Well, turn up the juice.",Youre imagining things.
His blood pressure's already 160/110. Any higher and,Riding the short bus is better than not breathing. Take us to 100.,Its the only time he can do it.
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.,Crank it up higher!,Thats where Im a little fuzzy.
You've already exceeded the preset maximum. Next step's brain damage.,In front of Clancy's face.,Get 500 more.
"Yep, we got them all.",Close him up.,"Thats right, I got mine."
Everything's going to be normal again.,You beliEve what Cuddy tried to pull?,Everything is going to be ok.
You beliEve what Cuddy tried to pull? What now?,"She lied to me. She cured my Patient with my diagnosis, then lied to me about it.",Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
That doesn't sound like her.,"You're right. It does sound like you, though.","No offense, but that sounds nothing like her."
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?,Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.,"He said its why they hired me, its, its what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they dont want to do."
"Something like that. More that if we told you the truth that you'd solved the case based on absolutely no medical proof, that you'd think you were God. And I was worried your wings would melt.","God doesn't limp. House leaves and Wilson looks very, very tired.",I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died.
"You're not gonna make this easy, are you? He picks up a syringe. Unfortunately as much as I admire your spirit, je ne sais rien.",71 year old cancer research specialist.,You got it!
You! have your cane.,"No, why the lacerations are creepy.","Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair."
So the! the pain's returned.,"There was no pain, he was unconscious. I'm guessing, because he wasn't able to breathe.",Well now I dont even feel like pie.
We're talking about you.,"Obviously. I'm obviously not. What is it with you people? I don't use the cane, you're shocked. I use the cane!","Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined."
We're just concerned.,"About the wrong person. I can breathe. Ezra Powell on the other hand, is gonna die.",Is that something we should be concerned about?
The researcher? The guy who wrote that textbook?,"That textbook, THE textbook.","Im pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?"
Wait - there's actually another doctor you admire?,"I! admire lots of doctors. 'Course most of them look a lot better in knee socks than Ezra Powell, but seeing as they can all breathe.","Yeah, theyre stuck inside the table!"
"So's his EKG, it's not his heart.",You're being too nice.,Gimme the leads.
"At 71, we get his heart or lungs to give out we might not get 'em to give in again.",That's why we're gonna do it in a hospital.,"But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left."
"Stop, this isn't working.",His heart rate barely got above 90.,It isnt working.
"He can't run, he can hardly walk.","It's 'cause he's not trying hard enough. If he was, his heart rate would go up.","I dont need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you."
Exercising with a lung full of your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.,They don't call it a stress test for nothing. Do it again.,Crushing my will to live isnt exercise.
You don't need a $400 handbag.,It's kinda hard to check your throat when you're flapping your gums around.,"Well, I cant spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag, but its free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation."
He starts filling out a prescription. What's that?,"Cold. He hands him the slip of paper. Take this 4 times a day, and stay off airplanes. Flying cesspools.",A bowl full of MMs with a few Ambien tossed in.
This isn't working. Dr. House!,Please don't get up. I'm sure you're very busy. He gets a syringe from a cart. I'm just gonna try and speed things up a little.,"Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone."
"No, he's right, let him -- let him do it.",See? That's why he doesn't have to wear knee socks.,"Yeah, let him do it."
He can't breathe.,"130. Powell looks scared, and like he can't breathe. The magic number. Nothing here. Foreman?",I am facing a great deal of work.
Still no sign of blockage.,Which means it's not the heart.,"I called, they said a transformer blew."
He's thought this through it's not an impulsive decision.,Neither is mine. He's depressed. He'll feel much better after we cure him.,"Very brave choice also, I thought."
"He's seen all the tests we've seen. Even if we figure out what was causing the lung damage, it's too late to rEverse it.",You can't know that without knowing what's wrong.,"Its too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound."
"Whose side are you on, senator? First respect his wishes, then invade Iraq, then get the troops home. Make up your mind.",Wow.,"All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He wont listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone elses home."
Coming up with a new treatment isn't gonna do us any good unless we convince him it's worth trying.,"Oh, come on. He's old, and sick, and tiny. We can do whatEver we want to him.",It looks like we dont have much of a choice but Ill remind him.
You're wasting your time. There must be other Patients you could actually help.,"No, all services rendered on a first-come, first-served basis.",Hold one finger up to Susan.
"House, you're hurting him.",You're hurting me.,Hey. Hey. Come on. Youre hurting him.
"We don't choose our birth, and we don't choose our death.",What if you could?,"Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same."
House! Foreman shakes his head.,"24 hours. Come on, it's not gonna kill you.","Uh, the kitchens fine."
You canNOT help him kill himself.,Of course I can. Chase says we do it all the time. Chase rolls his eyes.,Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him.
Cuddy's not gonna let you!,Enough!,"Im afraid I cant let you do that, Joe."
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia should be bacteria in his blood.,It's gonna take longer than 24 hours.,"Thats funny, I saw no phlegm."
"Not if I spin down the sample. Separate off the buffy coat, then gram stain for bacteria.",Nods.,Really? Were going to do an experiment?
All of that in 24 hours?,Nah. WhatEver you don't get done you can finish at the autopsy.,And it only took 28 minutes.
Purple dye on my fingers.,What'd the bone marrow biopsy show?,"My hands are dirty, too."
Don't have the results.,What? What've you been doing all night?,I did. It was inconclusive.
He hangs up. Who's that?,Your protg. What are these?,Who are you calling?
Dictation tapes. He records Everything.,Why?,For recording. Michael is on vacation and hes asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Because he's a diligent researcher?,Or he's losing his memory.,"Oh, right, because hes a scientist!"
A lot of people dictate their notes.,"Yes, we could assume that, and we'd have nothing.",How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
I'll go get an MRI of his head.,Keep testing 'til you find something. I'm going to my office to rest for awhile. They all glare after him.,"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
No abnormal nuclei means no leukemia he a drinker?,Not according to the history.,You dont drink.
"Which means yes, he drinks, which gives us a nice mundane explanation for the acellularity.",Or he's telling the truth. Which means fungus is still on the table.,Im told he drinks all night.
"But your entire view of huMan nature gets destroyed. He shrugs. Six of one, half a dozen of the other.",Bad news fast. Good news you can take your time.,"Okay. Three, two, and were done."
"Head is clean. You were wrong, his faculties are intact.","Too bad. If his brain was addled, we wouldn't have to listen to anything he says.",There is not one hair on that head.
It's 4 o'clock we have nothing to tell him.,Then we have no reason to talk to him. We still haven't ruled out fungus.,"Its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime."
"Yup, we have. No buds, no hyphae.","Sighs. Okay. Next procedure we sneak in, turn back the clock. Wilson smiles, Cameron looks forlorn.","Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?"
Whole team. Must Coughs. be bad news.,Nope.,Are we playing individual or teams?
What about my breathing?,Associated hyperviscosity syndrome gummed up the blood vessels in your lungs.,Can you stop breathing so loud?
Dr. Chase said my calcium is normal.,"Mm. We call him Dr. Idiot. Chase rolls his eyes, Foreman crosses his arms.","Um, I dont seem to have it, sir."
There's no M-protein in my urine.,Odd presentation.,Not my urine.
So odd that Dr. Cameron doesn't beliEve it either. House turns and glares at her.,Just give me 12 more hours.,"I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts."
We had a deal. No more tests.,Fair enough. Give me six more hours. Powell purses his lips. Listen there is no evidence that you are terminal.,"Well, for one thing, were late for Leonards birthday party."
You a Man of your word or not?,"No, as a matter of fact, I'm not.","Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"
Where you going? Nowhere.,Everybody who can walk should get outta here. House takes morphine and a syringe out of the kit.,"Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D."
You can't do that.,Can't do what? Administer a prescription painkiller to a Patient who's in pain? Go. Make sure somebody sees you downstairs in the cafeteria.,"Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now hes walking around thinking, Do I want to be a dad? and then bam!"
No it's about whether you die or we murder you.,"Holding up syringe, while talking to Foreman.","Of course its about that, you twat."
"Quietly, to House. Thank you. House gives a quick nod. I've always wondered exactly what was on the other side.",Nothing.,Pennys apartment. She answers the door.
What are you doing?,"Getting a laryngoscope. House grabs a laryngoscope. Don't just stand there, help.","Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?"
But you told him,Interrupting.,You had to tell him?
"Interrupting. Yeah. A little something I like to call a lie. Bad I know, but it's way further down the list than murder. He intubates Ezra and starts to pump the ambu bag. He's unconscious. No more whining. I'm gonna keep testing him. Chase looks confused and indignant. Go get a ventilator, not gonna do this all night.",We can legally assume that he'd consent to whatEver a reasonable person would consent to. Cut to House's office.,"I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone."
And a reasonable person would obviously consent to being put in a coma against their will just to satisfy your curiosity.,"Fake exasperation with a hint of real exasperation. I try to kill him, you're mad. I don't kill him you're mad.",You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose?
All he wanted was some dignity.,Were you in that room with him?,Let me go with a bit of dignity.
"I wanted to get his brain-stem and his C-spine, make sure his diaphragm wasn't paralyzed.",You also caught the top of his lungs. There's scarring. Cameron is staring at him. You do know that you can't really pierce me with your stares.,"Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price."
Could be pulmonary fibrosis. Or Lupus.,"He can kill himself after we get him better. Start him on an IVIG for the Lupus, and get a colonoscopy. Lupus could be hiding there.","Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl."
I can't do this. She leaves.,Drama queen.,Let her go.
I don't think she's gonna have a pRoblem deciding what to tell Cuddy. Ezra's heart monitor starts beeping. O2 sats 89 and dropping.,Thought you were only supposed to put on a pound a week during your last trimester.,"Mm, Pennys gonna call her dad and tell him its not a good time for Randall to visit."
Sighs. I'm not pregnant. I heard about your little stunt with Dr. Powell.,"Makes a drawn out whining sound. Not really a stunt. More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink.","Oh, no umm, hi, thatthat, you have to put that out, cause Im pregnant."
"More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink. A lie.",Ok.,So wed be perpetrating a ruse?
He's not gonna learn anything I just thought the same principle might apply. It does.,I coulda just let him die.,He wouldnt have learned anything that way.
Not gonna get sued for keeping him alive.,"Well, we could we completely disregarded his wishes.","He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life."
"Do you want me to disagree with you? Turns to House, they stop walking. Sarcastically. Want me to yell at you?",It is comforting.,"No, no, no, no."
"We're doctors We treat Patients, we don't kill them.","Raises voice, speaking into her lapel pin as though it is a microphone.",We dont need every house in the North.
I'm sorry about your leg.,Yeah. Walks away. We really should spend some time talking about that. Cuddy sighs.,Im sorry! It wasnt your whole toe!
The IVIG made him worse. O2 stats plummeted.,Sighs. So we know it's not Lupus. What else could it be?,"Wow Thats terrible, I really liked him."
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,Gonna need an open lung biopsy to confirm. House goes into a lounge Chase and Foreman follow.,"Fine. Ive hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. Im just trying to clean up after your mess. Well talk in the morning."
"So, now we're going to operate on the guy?",Unless you've invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.,"Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we cant operate. But we can prep the guy!"
Unless you've invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.,"When you searched Dr. Powell's office, did you find a copy of the January, 1967 Massachusetts Medical Journal?","Maybe when I publish it, Ill include an inhaler."
"Powell's office, did you find a copy of the January, 1967 Massachusetts Medical Journal? Why?","I just figured, if you're not doing any work, you might like something to pass the time. Centerfold's a killer. House walks away, leaving Cameron curious.",Were gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
"I just figured, if you're not doing any work, you might like something to pass the time. Centerfold's a killer. House walks away, leaving Cameron curious.",Fake cheering of an audience. Wilson enters.,I had nothing else to do tonight.
How's your leg?,It hurts. Sighs. It's gonna keep on hurting. You gonna keep on asking?,"Hey, how are you holding up?"
How's Ezra Powell?,Resting comfortably.,"So, uh, how was he?"
"Hmm, that's not what Cameron says.",I hate practicing medicine in high school.,Thats not what she said last night.
He's not asking you to help him kill himself he's just asking for help. The disease will kill him.,I know what he was asking for I just said 'no'.,I dont think hes the one who needs help.
You've done it before. Plenty of times.,To Patients that I knew were terminal.,"Whats the big deal, youve done this before."
"Annoyed. Oh, give me a break. This has nothing to do with saving a life you just can't bear the thought of a Patient dying before you've been able to figure out why.",If we're gonna keep refusing to cure Patients just to rein in my ego then we might start having a little pRoblem with Patient recruitment. House's pager goes off.,"Lets see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die."
Snidely. Worried about meeting your one Patient a week quota?,"Leaving. I'm a cripple, remember. Accommodations must be made.","So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?"
Why'd you have me look up that article?,Didn't you find it interesting?,"I was kind of excited about the article, but now youre making me feel bad."
He injected newborn babies with radioactive agents just to see if they had urethral reflux.,He was curious.,And what occurred in his chamber?
He didn't Even tell their parents he was doing an experiment.,He wasn't doing anything his peers weren't doing.,Its not an experiment!
His peers at Tuskegee and Willowbrook?!,He ignored the rights of the few to save Many.,Who was Cornells eighth president?
So you're okay with what he did.,Doesn't matter what I think. It's what you think that's relevant.,So you really OK about all this?
"Because, if I think less of him, I'll help you more? You're wrong. The fact that a Patient did bad things doesn't change anything. He still deserves to have some control over his own body.","If he had control of his own body, he'd be dead.","I dont understand, why didnt you help that man?"
Some control. We can withhold treatment without killing him.,No you can't!,Youre asking him to give up all of his power.
"No you can't! You either help him live, or you help him die you can't have it both ways. Chase looks up at House from the operating room and shakes his head.",Well I guess it's not IPF. Ezra's heart monitor starts beeping.,"No, Toby, this is different."
Well I guess it's not IPF. Ezra's heart monitor starts beeping.,"Well, maybe he'll die right now. Make Everything easy for all of us. He leaves and Cameron is alone in the observation room.","Phoebes apartment, Phoebe is still investigating the smoke detector trying to figure out how to stop the beeping."
"BP's low. House takes stethoscope from random surgeon, then checks Ezra with it.",No breath sounds on the right side he's dropped his right lung.,"A Medical Research Office, Joey is there to sign up for an experiment, any experiment."
"What are you doing? House prods Ezra's left foot, and it twitches.","Withdraws from pain stimuli on the left side, but not the right.",Why arent you moving your feet?
Those are just reflex arcs he's under anesthesia.,Or he's lost sensation in some places.,Are those just show muscles?
Or the hypoxia from the arrest stunned his CNS.,Only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials.,"He didnt know it till he was cuffed, but yeah."
We can't do that while he's in a coma.,Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer and check his deep tendon reflexes.,"I cant! If he realizes that Im the one that put him to sleep, I wont get the job!"
Won't work. He needs muscle relaxants to be on the ventilator.,"Long blink, thinking. Only one more way to tell. Pupillary reflexes.",We were just talking about you.
All that tests is the brainstem.,"See, I was right only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials.",Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
I just said we can't do that while he's in a coma.,So wake him up. House leaves.,"I said we are not going to do it, okay?"
So wake him up. House leaves.,Don't go towards the light. You'll fall and break your hip.,Help me get him inside.
What's happening? I --,You took a little nap.,Whats happening?! Whats happening?!
"No, I! I told you I didn't want --","Interrupting. Sorry, little deaf in one ear. Your bone marrow was hypocellular we ruled out lupus and pulmonary fibrosis, but it looks like it could be attacking your nerves.","Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I dont want to force you into something you dont want to do."
"So, this is all a waste, a huge fail! Gasps. failure. Impossible, you're Gregory House.",We need to attach some sensors to your skin.,Oh! So you think Im a failure!
We need to attach some sensors to your skin. No.,"Look, we can't do what you want we've assigned a nurse to watch you so you can't do it either.","Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor."
Then take them out!,"Oh, get over yourself.",Ill just throw them out.
"Oh, get over yourself. The ventilator puffed up your lungs you'll be fine for a few hours. Just let us run the tests. Ezra rips off some leads that were attached to him.","Ok. But first, let's clean you up a little. He grabs a glass of water and splashes a few drops of it on Ezra's chest. That feel nice?","Okay. Its okay. Were gonna be okay. Yknow what? Its okay. Im gonna, Im gonna, Im gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!"
Curious. What are you trying to prove?,Just cleaning him up.,"Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?"
"He does the same to his left, and this time the foot twitches. Get out!","Okay, I'm going already. Can't you see I'm a cripple? House leaves.","Excuse me? Oh. Youre so educated, arent you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I dont want to look at his feet. Do your job!"
"Ok, so you got me curious.",I was right whatEver is attacking his lungs is attacking his nerves.,"Okay, alright, I have a question, then."
You got that by splashing ice water on him?,"No sensation in the left leg, abdomen, right arm. Technology's overrated.",Did you offer him a hot beverage?
That means the clean MRI of his brain means it's just affecting the peripheral nerves.,And bone marrow.,All right.
Or lymphoma. Or sarcoidosis.,All potentially treatable. Question is which. We need to catch the little bastards in the act. What's the largest organ?,"UhOh. Its Isaac Newton, and hes pissed."
What's the largest organ? Skin.,We need to get a piece. House leaves them standing there.,"Man, that things bigger than I am."
"Sure, we'll just wait until he leaves his room without his skin, sneak in, and take a piece. Chase snickers.",I want you to get a skin sample for a biopsy.,"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us."
And I wanna get a foot massage from Johnny Damon.,"Walking towards the desk. Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis are all treatable.",I got you the foot massager.
And it could be a hundred other things that aren't treatable. You have no idea.,But you do you know Everything.,Really? Are you sure?
I didn't say that I -,Slams cane down on desk.,I didnt say that.
I'm not gonna lie to him.,"Fine, tell the truth. Just get me a pound of flesh.","Okay, but if he asks, Im not going to lie."
"Dr. House? House looks over in surprise. Hi, how are you?",Not as good as you think I am.,Dr. Green. How are you?
"Don't worry, I'm not stalking you. My dad just lost his medicine he had to come back for another prescription.","Yeah, right. He's moving it on the street, isn't he?",Could you leave a note?
Why haven't you returned any of my calls?,He stops and thinks. I plan to. In a couple of years.,Thank you. How come you didnt call me this morning?
I was just calling to say 'thank you.' And to tell you how impressed I was you diagnosed my dad by just looking at him.,"Felt his glands, too. Ali gives a slight laugh.",Shhh! Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
"Oh, there's my dad I gotta go.",Yeah. Me too.,I have to go.
"At a microscope as House enters. It's not Kawasaki's, either. What's next?",Congo red.,The guys laboratory
Congo red. Amyloidosis?,What the hell else would I mean by 'Congo red?',I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.
There's no reason for it to be on the list.,An abnormal protein is building up inside the cells of his body shutting down his organs one by one.,"It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun."
"We rejected Amyloidosis, because it didn't fit the first symptom we found. It would affect his heart.",It did.,I wouldnt own the company if it wasnt for you.
It wasn't on the stress test.,We didn't push him hard enough. To Chase. Add the stain let's find out.,"Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation."
Congo red added.,"Change the polarization of the light, already. Results confirm that it is Amyloidosis.",Fine. Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?
How the hell you pull that out of --,Interrupting. Not outta mine. I had a muse.,Just pull on it.
Everyone looks disheartened -- And House hands Cameron a candy bar. Dr. House.,"You have Amyloidosis it's in your lungs, kidneys, bone marrow, and brain.","Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up."
Why should I beliEve you now?,"If I was lying, I wouldn't tell you the subtype is AA. It's terminal.","Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?"
Ezra Powell passed away last night. I'm sure you already knew about that.,Shakes his head a little. No. I just got in.,I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
"The nurse charted at 2 AM he was stable. Breathing labored, but regular. And at 230 he suddenly stopped. House is thinking. You know anything about that?","If I did, would you really wanna know? Cuddy nods and then leaves.","Chandler and Joeys, Joey is entering, angrily."
"If I did, would you really wanna know? Cuddy nods and then leaves.",Puts his hand on her shoulder. I'm proud of you.,"No, I dont want to know."
"That's impossible, it's mac and cheese.",10-yr-old boy screams for his life for no reason.,Want some mac and cheese?
"He's autistic, sEverely autistic. Can't talk, can't make eye contact. Screaming's pRobably his way of communicating.",And he went to 3 different doctors who all said just that.,Im not scream Im not screaming.
"Wow, so clearly that can't be the answer. His brain can't filter information, it's a constant assault on his senses I'd scream too.",Or it's something medical sounding like dysesthesia.,"Uhhuh. Okay. Okay, dont you think, maybe, though, its just that hes so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
Since when do we start believing parents? Or anyone? Where are we going?,Elevator.,I guess we let them wait until theyre old enough and let them choose their own theory.
"So they're overprotective and scared, that's all the more reason to--","They've studied this kid, heard him scream a million times. Did 10 years of caring for him, this is the first time they've brought him to a hospital.","Good, you dont want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?"
ER said the heart was fine.,Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.,Rachel said everything was okay.
Where are we going?,"Down. Stool sample to check for parasites, blood culture to rule out infection and ANA for lupus.",What? Whats on your shoulder?
"Could also be an environmental reaction an allergy, dust, wheat, pollen, a toxin.","Check the House. Run a lung ventilation scan. Lungs are in the chest too, right?","Im having contractions, but theyre irregular and far apart."
"I had a date last night, she screamed. Should we spend a 100,000 dollars testing her?","Of course not, this isn't a veterinary hospital. Zing! He pushes the door open into the clinic. Look, if you don't think this kid is worth saving--","Either that or shes just the best, most expensive date I ever had."
That's not what I'm saying!,"Well that's too bad, it's a good point.","What? No, thats not what Im saying."
"Well that's too bad, it's a good point. Kid's just a lump with tonsils. You know what it's going to be like trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner? I don't envy you guys. He opens the door to Cuddy's office and leaves them to their job.","I want my old carpet back. He bangs his cane on to her desk, she's on the phone.",I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I dont care!
Err we're going to have to do this later. A kid in the clinic had an accident. She puts the phone down. Generally when people are on the phone--,I want my old carpet back.,Im having... Im having a baby. Im having a... Wheres the phone? The phone?
"It was stained, with blood.","Yeah, my blood. Which makes the carpet part of me, I want it back. I want to be buried with it.","Dwight, come on now, its time to put in the subs."
You think you can get me to do anything you want regardless of how stupid it is?,"It's my office it's where I work, where I think, where I save lives, allowing you to brag to rich people so they'll give you more money to spend on MRIs and low-cut tops.",And it works both ways.
"It's identical to the old carpet, except without the hazardous biological waste.",I shall not return to my office until Every patented durable microfibre has been restored to its rightful place.,"Yeah, well, Im just saying its garbage soil, thats all."
"Inspiring. She puts up her feet on the desk. If you don't want to work in your office, work in the clinic. You don't want to work in the clinic, go home and don't get paid.",Banging on the floor with his cane. Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Stops banging the cane and looks at her. Attica?,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office Assst."
Hey doctor House.,Hello girl whose name I don't remember but whose dad I treated so I don't really know why she's here.,"Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, its so good to see you again."
Ali. Umm... I think I caught what my dad has. The rhino thing.,Right. He presses two fingers into two spots on her forehead. Does that hurt?,Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
A little. It's in my chest too.,Of course it is.,"Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today."
That feels good.,Exactly when did New Jersey run out of horny 17-yr-old boys?,"Well, that makes me feel so good."
"The ventilation scan was normal, time to send him home.","Can't leave right now. Turns back to Ali. Well congratulations, you are the proud owner of your very own rhino thing.",Wait. What are you writing? Dont write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? Cause Im suffering from both.
A rhinovirus? You can't leave because she has a cold?,Can't leave because Cuddy says I can't leave.,"Shes pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave."
"Hey, don't start with me. We're backed up.",I know this is hard for all of us but thanks to doctor Cuddy I don't have an office so I have to work here.,"We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
What'd she do to your office?,"It's unusable. So, whatEver's bothering him it wasn't his lungs. What about the kid's House?",She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Which means there's nothing physically wrong with this kid.,We already had that discussion. Did we get a fecal smear? He purposely says the last bit louder to ick out the people in the clinic.,"Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development."
Should we do this some place else?,"Nope, Cuddy says I have to work here.",So where should we do it?
"Walking out of her office. No, I said you can work in your office or you had to work here.",And since I can't work in my office.,"Uh, I kind of told her I was working."
Is this your master plan? Disrupt hospital business until I replace your carpet?,"Devious. Saw it in a James Bond movie. Raising the volume. Fecal smear, talk to me!","All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurses office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed."
Get out of here.,Put back my carpet?,Get outta here.
No! Get out of here!,"Fecal matter, is there a sample we can look at?","No, you get outta here."
"Do what you want, not replacing your carpet. She smiles in victory and struts back into her office.","Go up his rear and get a smear. Which reminds me, I kinda feel like a bagel. He walks out of the clinic.","Alright! Dont get too comfortable there, because Im back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I cant say that I care too much for the way youve rearranged my office."
Adam! Adam!,So what makes fluid fill the lining of a kid's lungs?,"Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!"
Why are we in here? This is some sort of power play?,Yeah.,What is this?
Or do you really have a pRoblem with the carpeting? Change sets you off--,"I said it was a power play, someone answers yes to option A, you don't move on to option B.","Yeah, so sorry about this Godawful carpet, were still a work in progress here."
Why now? Why a power play now?,I smelled weakness.,So why now?
"That's funny it says Wilson, what a strange typo.",The fluid comes back in exudate get him on broad spectrum antibiotics.,"Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether."
Thank you for coming. No pRoblem.,Thought you wouldn't mind sharing offices for a while.,"Hi, thanks for coming."
"You share stories, feelings... toys. You don't share offices.",That is so not Zen.,"Well, we could if it were true."
"It was a gift, some doctors get those.",So you want mornings or afternoons?,"Oh, I dont know."
Hangs up his lab coat. You couldn't make Cuddy miserable so you're going to make me miserable so I can make Cuddy miserable on your behalf?,Yep.,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
What makes you think I can make her miserable? Starts rolling up his sleEves.,Because you're good at that stuff.,"Hmm. Itd have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as shes making me. Oh, Ive got it. This is good."
"Ohhh, I'm nothing compared to you.",Picks up a random toy. Is there anything you'll throw out?,"Yeah, but you shouldnt compare yourself to me."
"That's a gift from an 11-yr-old Patient of mine, she and I both knew it was a piece of junk and that's what made her laugh.",So you gotta keep it until she! He draws his hand across his neck and makes an execution sound.,"Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... its a stuffed animal... you know... its for kids... not for adults... I know that!"
What are you doing here? I have this room booked from 2 to 3.,Turns around and feigns surprise.,This rooms available.
It's 2 o' clock.,"Oh well, we should go then. Ducklings are about to get up again. That just leaves cancer. Get a lung biopsy.",Its a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
It took a half an hour to get a mask on the kid for the lung scan!,"Well I'm sorry, was there somewhere you needed to be?",All right! Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
"House, can we talk?",Carpet?,"Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?"
Carpet? NEver.,Nothing to talk about.,"Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet."
Your girlfriend called the clinic 15 times looking for you today.,"Huh. A lot to discuss, Parkna patterns--","Michael, why dont you call your girlfriend?"
"House, she's a stalker.","Right, couldn't be that she finds me interesting and attractive. Has to be that she's insane.","Chandler, she doesnt understand a word of English."
She's called you 15 times your mother's not that interested in you.,Well maybe I'd be better adjusted if she was.,And shes never called here.
I'm notifying security.,Is this about the carpet? Do you think I'll back off if you block all my fun?,"You stay away from me, or Im calling security."
You better not be having fun!,I'm having fun. I'm not having sex.,This is not fun!
I'm not having sex. She's dangerous!,She's not dangerous.,You cant have sex with her!
She's not dangerous. She's pretty.,She's pretty.,"Shes scary, but its a cute scary."
Men are stupid.,I'm with you so far.,"Go on, teach me something about men and women."
I'm notifying security.,"Oh, give her a break, she's not dangerous, she's...","Pam, please call security!"
"Still, just to be safe, you mind? Wilson shakes his head.","For the love of god, can't somebody shut that kid up? Got people trying to work around here. To Wilson. Why don't you show him a teddy bear or something?","Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?"
Who are you?,Somebody you'll nEver send a gift to.,Wasnt Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?
"This is doctor House, your son's doctor.",He picks up the gas mask.,Oh no Dr.
What are you doing?,Eating the red berries.,Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
He trusted you.,"No, that wasn't trust. That was self-preservation.",But you trust him?
"No, that was huge. It was like a conversation.",Tries to get up and unsteadily hangs on to the overhanging lights.,"It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have."
That was sensitive.,You have pretty hair.,"Okay, what? What is too sensitive?"
Hope is all those parents have going for them.,"No, hope is what's making them miserable.",Youre supposed to realize that they are adults!
Is it so wrong for them to want to have a normal Parkld? It's normal to want to be normal.,Spoken like a true circle queen.,"Uh, hey, its your business."
So it's wrong to feel sorry for this little boy?,"Why would you feel sorry for someone who gets to opt out of the inane courteous formalities which are utterly meaningless, insincere and therefore degrading?",I dont believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father.
Then what are they? Liver cells.,Wow. Liver cells under his arm. I wonder what he's got where his liver's supposed to be.,"No actually umm, I think that theyre umm, gas."
Wow. Liver cells under his arm. I wonder what he's got where his liver's supposed to be.,Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?,Who knows what he has down there.
Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?,"Make yourself at home. So, think maybe Gray's Anatomy got it all wrong?",How did you get paint in your eye?
But we're not talking about cancer cells.,"So what's the difference between cancer cells and liver cells, why can one pass through walls but the other can't?",I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin up from here.
"Cancer cells are damaged lets them go into blood vessels, go wherEver they want.",So if the liver cells are damaged...,"For localized melanoma, the fiveyear survival rate is 98%."
Liver isn't damaged. The tests were normal.,"So if the liver cells are damaged -- it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system. Liver failure could also explain pleural effusion, Even the heart issues.","Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?"
"Liver cells are fine, he was immunized for Hep A and B and do you really think this kid is having unprotected sex or sharing needles?","Hmm, daddy does seem the type to use a rubber. So it's not viral. He gets up and starts pacing. Just leaves a lot of boozerosis.","No, we havent spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton."
"House, when we echoed his heart we got a piece of his liver, there was no scarring.","Cirrhosis explains the symptoms heart pRoblems, lungs.","Michael, he made huge cuts."
Parents aren't doing or dosing this kid.,How would you know that? Kid can't talk. Why'd you think I took this case? He's not going to give away the ending.,"Look, I, I get that youre protective of your grandson, but hes an adult now."
They quit their jobs for him.,"Yes, they are Everything you'd want in a parent.","He may be their leader, but they chose him."
So you figure they slipped the kid a mickey so they don't have to deal.,"Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy.",I dont get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids.
"Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy.",My parents love me unconditionally. Get out of here.,"Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I cant remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells."
Not doing it. She continues walking down leaving a disappointed Wilson.,Liver biopsy?,"Just keep walking, dont give her anything."
They're doing it now.,How's it going?,Thats weird. I bet theyre doing it.
"Like a biopsy needles, cells, screaming.",What'd you find in the stool sample?,Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
"You were too busy bothering Cuddy, as discussed it was negative for parasites. Can we get out of here?",I didn't ask what you didn't find I asked what you did find in the stool sample.,"No, actually, see I had to pee, cause I cant use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites."
"Stool. And traces of iron, zinc, calcium carbonate, can we leave?",What's the matter? You afraid of the Man?,"Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out."
What's the matter? You afraid of the Man?,"Uh oh, too late.",Im afraid of him.
Leave my stuff alone!,You're meeting with a Guggenheim in 15 minutes wearing that?,Stop going through my stuff !
"I'm going to count to 3 and then, I'm going to fire you. One.","Calcium carbonate, that's uhh... antidiarrheal, right?",Im going to count to three.
"antidiarrheal, right? Two.",Think that's significant?,A powerful laxative.
Thank god you don't have Parkldren. Doctor Cuddy.,Take a message.,You need to get that Dr Cooper?
Your Patient is being rushed to cardiac ICU.,"Wow, that's like the one thing that would get me out of here.",You want one of your own?
"He's stable for the moment, first degree atrioventricular block.","Okay, what else do we know?",You should try it.
Biopsy was negative for cirrhosis. Parents didn't poison their son.,"It's not his liver, his heart or his lungs. The calcium carbonate in his stool.",My father was poisoned by our enemies.
"He's constipated, parents pRobably just overdid it.",Or they didn't do it at all. Calcium carbonate's also what's in chalk.,"When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his moms pants out."
"So he ate some chalk, it isn't toxic, sure didn't cause the pleural effusion.",Forget the chalk.,"Wait, does he eat chalk?"
You just said it was about the chalk.,"Yes, and then I said forget the chalk, you must be very confused. This kid's got pica. Take him to a buffet he's going to eat the table.","Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didnt mind."
LEvel of lead in the blood was normal. His tox screen was clean.,"We're not looking for typical poisons we're looking for anything that he can put in his mouth matches, spiders, bricks.","And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachels bag you will find a halfeaten box of cookies in there."
Pressure-treated wood used to contain arsenic.,"Even better. To Foreman. Hansel, get samples of the gingerbread House bag Everything.","Hey, heres a question where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?"
"Hansel, get samples of the gingerbread House bag Everything. Hey.",You can get into a lot of trouble being here.,"Dwight, little help with the bags, please."
I wanted to see you.,"Yeah, I got that. So did Everyone else, they think you're a stalker.",Lets get to it.
One could argue those people might be jealous of your attention.,Yes I actually made that argument.,"Oh, well, ah."
You going home?,That's the plan.,You headed out?
In Iceland the age of consent is 14.,I'm surprised that tourism isn't a bigger industry up there.,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
So today I'm jailbait but in 22 weeks anybody can do anything to me. Will I be so different in 22 weeks?,22 weeks is enough for an embryo to grow arms and legs.,"In 20 years, who knows whatll happen with any of us?"
It's just a line an arbitrary line drawn by a bunch of sad old men in Robes.,"Yeah, who cares what Judges think.",Why is there a circle with a line through it?
Didn't think of you as a guy who followed rules just because they were rules.,You are over 10 years younger than me. Ali makes a face. I said over.,I told you were way past rules.
You are over 10 years younger than me. Ali makes a face. I said over.,Gotta go!,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
Gotta go! House.,"Doctor Cuddy, do you happen to know the way to the Icelandic consulate? This young Woman, a stranger to me, was just asking directions.",Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?
Security was going to call the police I don't want to do that to you. Go home.,She needed a ride.,"Okay, security guard."
"She got here on her own she can get home on her own. Now! Ali grudgingly gets off House's bike. And if I see you on hospital grounds again, I will call the police.","After that look I'm feeling a little frisky, looks like you're up.","Monica, do you want us to take you home?"
"I'm ovulating, let's go.",The frisky it went away.,"Uch, you see, Im ovulating."
"House, this isn't a game.",If I leave her alone can I have my carpet back?,"This is not a game, this is my life."
If I leave her alone can I have my carpet back? No.,If I forget about my carpet can I have her?,"You know what, youve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet."
Meeting here will do nothing to upset Cuddy.,I'm not trying to upset Cuddy I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with the Patient. Continue.,"Theres not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation."
Jimson weed doesn't explain the screaming.,You've obviously nEver had a bad trip.,People use marijuana to escape.
I would have thought you'd try to accomplish two goals at once.,Why can't you be more like the other age inappropriate girls who have a thing for me? Just accept me for me. Continue.,"I got to admit, we didnt think youd be able to do two things at once."
He won't survive 3 days.,What time does he wake up?,Hes not gonna make it.
What time does he wake up? 7.35am.,Then what? Walk me through it.,You said he goes to bed at nine.
"7.40 - 7.50 he goes to the toilet, washes his face, what does this matter?",I'm trying to prove he ate the plant.,"Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a."
His schedule has nothing to do with Jimson weed.,"There are two possibilities, either the parents saw him eat the plant or the kid has unsupervised time and eats plants instead of playing blocks.","Really? Thats interesting. Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decisionmaking process as someone like me whos here every day. And frankly, killing it lately."
Even if you find 15 minutes of free time outside doesn't mean he spent it eating a bush.,So what do we do? Nothing? Wait for the kid to tell us? What?,"Thats why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table."
Where are you going?,To talk to him.,"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?"
To talk to him.,Ever see your son eat a bush?,You want us to talk to him?
I've only Ever seen him eat leftover--,Adam!,I never see him drink.
He can't answer you.,Neither can you.,"Um, why dont you go ask him that?"
He doesn't know what you want.,"Adam, you have to tell me because if you don't, He picks up the PSP and shows the game over screen on it. it'll be game over, you'll be dead.","Oh. Listen, do you think and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?"
What the hell are you doing?,Show me what you ate. Adam! Show me what you ate.,What the fuck you doing here?
Adam? Honey? Adam!,"At the podium in the front of the room, talking in a spot-on Southern accent. Come on in, brothers and sister. Welcome to the House of the Lord!","Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes."
"House, come on, the chapel?",One of the strangers leaves.,THE THRONE ROOM
"It's consistent with Jimson weed poisoning, ocular paralysis. The other stranger gets up to leave. Sorry.","The wicked shall deceive ye because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots, his ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted.",Our eyes are closed and were about to cross the street.
"The wicked shall deceive ye because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots, his ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted. MS.",It is easier for a wise Man to gain access to heaven!,"He had no arms or legs, he couldnt hear see, or speak."
"Stroke, bleed in the brain.","Back to his normal American accent. We'd be seeing other symptoms besides a single eye misalignment, like a coma, and you've already testified.",A lot of other gas smells
"It's a micro tumor. Started in his lung which caused the pleural effusion, then it metastasized to his liver which made it slough cells. And then went to his brain behind the eye which caused it to roll back into his head.",So he has 3 tumors and we missed all of them. What's the opposite of a miracle?,"Oh, its a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades."
"I've a better chance of finding it now that I know exactly where to look. So, unless you have a better idea, I'm going to go CT his head and then if I have to, remove his eye.",You remove this kid's eye he's only going to be half as good at not making eye contact.,Yeah. The doctor didnt want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
Hello? Hello? Hello? House finally looks up. I have sad news for you. She doesn't love you.,You're ugly when you're jealous.,She doesnt love you.
"She showed up at my House last night, came on to me.",She's Even more perfect than I thought.,"Oh, shes meeting us here."
House! She's sick.,"You say sick, I say freestyling.","Monica and Chandlers, Monica is still sick and is hobbling out into the living room for some help from Chandler whos on the couch reading."
The girl will have sex with an invertebrate.,"Come on, you're not that bad.",What happens if she has a boy?
She has a pRoblem. You're not doing her any favors by indulging her!,Why would you lie like this? Do you not have room in your heart for love?,"Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!"
You don't beliEve me.,I didn't beliEve the kids when they said that Suzie was sleeping with Johnny.,"I dont believe you, youre lying to me."
She has a mole on her right breast just below the nipple.,Softly. No she doesn't.,What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
You've seen her breasts?!,"It was a medical exam. I was listening to her heart it went Greg House, Greg House, Greg House.",Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
"Fine, I'm lying. But she did come back, she's locked up in my office, I was hoping you could talk to her, put an end to this.",Listen to me do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed with me?,"Oh no, shes still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her."
You're only saying that to make me go.,I'm saying it 'coz it's true.,No! I will... go.
Starting to cry. What about us?,We'll always have Fresno.,"Hey, I know you."
Was there an earthquake when you were in Fresno? What?,I ask all my girlfriends that.,And Im not?
Umm... yeah a little one.,Damn.,"Yeah, a couple."
What? What is it?,"It's not love, you have spore in your brain Coccidioides immitis.",What?! What?!! What is it?!
"So loving you, wanting to have sex with you is all just the spores talking?",Hands her a prescription. You'll pRobably live. Damn!,"Oh, everything is just sex with you isnt it?"
Hands her a prescription. You'll pRobably live. Damn!,Hey! Don't touch his eye!,"Ill try to keep you alive, for her sake."
This is an appendectomy.,"Like I said, don't touch his eye.",Talk me through an appendectomy.
"Like I said, don't touch his eye.",Why isn't he in surgery?,Dont you ever touch him.
Some emergency bumped him we've got another room in 10 minutes.,"Better not take him in, kill the lights. He sits on Adam's bed. He's seeing them all the time.",We gotta get someone else in there right now.
What are you looking for?,Using a light to peer into Adam's pupil.,"Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And Im closing the door."
What are you talking about? What was he seeing?,Peers into the pupil again and now we can see the squiggly lines Adam was drawing...,"But I couldnt even if I wanted to, because I dont know!"
Stool samples were negative for parasites.,Raccoon roundworms are not excreted by their huMan host.,"Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, nono cat litter boxes, no paint fumes."
Cameron tested the sand.,All of it?,And those sand grains are tumbling.
"Wait a minute, that's it? He's going to be ok?","Good news, he's going to be with you for a long, long time.",Well yeahyeah the Scottish history is so much more
"You're not autistic you don't Even have Asperger's. You wish you did, it would exempt you from the rules, give you freedom, absolve you of responsibility, let you date 17-yr-olds. But most important it would mean that you're not just a jerk.",At what point does a person endlessly lecturing someone make him a jerk?,"No, I dont think youre either of those things."
You saved his life.,"Yeah I know, see ya.",He saved me.
20-yr-old married African-American female couldn't breathe. Anaphylaxis-like throat-swelling.,Parkldren?,The problem appears to be unsolvable.
You think pregnancy would explain the--,It explains the marriage. Who the hell gets married at 20?,This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
I'm guessing people in love?,Show me a 20-yr-old who's not in love.,I suppose mainly sexual.
"Not allergies, negative on the skin test - 4 days of antihistamines and steroids.",Who's he talking to?,"Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic."
Who's he talking to? What?,"It's got an ass, technically that makes it a who.",Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
Uhh... new nurse in Peds. Wendy something. Swelling just started to go down.,You seen her here before?,"Hi, Im Joshua, Im here to pick up Rachel."
"I tried following her home, but she gave me the slip. Swelling's--","You think that's funny, ask him about the time he sabotaged my cane.",I spent three days looking for her.
"There was a point to it. Wendy, this is House.",Something about not getting too uppity with normal folks who walk good.,"Because thats thats what this is all about, Morty."
grimaces at House Why so rude?,"You sprinted through 3 bad marriages, into an affair with a dying Patient - now a naughty nurse?","Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes."
It's amazing how you can not only know it's a relationship but that it's a bad relationship based on nothing but... nothing.,I know you.,Why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff.
"I'm not with her, not Even trying.","You're lying to me, that's interesting.",I dont love her.
"walking towards his office Well, as long as it's interesting. Swelling is--",Why is she hanging out here?,Anything to get out of that office.
Anyone interesting in what happened with the swelling?,"She's in Peds, it's the next wing over.",What the hell is that.
"Clearly he did and Wilson denied it, and House doesn't beliEve him. It's gotta hurt, that's why it pays to have more than one friend, House.",If he's not hitting that then why's she here?,He says they didnt do it.
"Because I'm hitting that and it's totally hot. House, Chase and Foreman look at her shocked for a moment Swelling took 4 days to resolve, Patient has unexplained intensive abdominal pains.",So explain them. Wake me when they've done an exploratory laparotomy. Anybody know her? Know her story?,"Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we wont mention."
"Up an' at 'em. she spreads the case file on the table in front of House They did a laparotomy. Liver, bowel, gall bladder, appendix all clean.",Belly pain plus throat swelling.,"Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel."
"Sorry, take it back, that's a stretch.",Got a better idea? Silence Then stretch away. Start her on floroquinolone for the salmonella.,"All right well, Id better take that back."
I was waiting 2 hours out there. He puts a piece of gum in his mouth and House closes the door,Fascinating. Have you considered a career as a memoirist? He sits down on the stool Let's see it.,"I think I was supposed to say, I dont know, and go over and open the door."
You don't introduce yourself? He starts unzipping his pants,"Sorry, I thought you were waiting 2 hours, didn't know you wanted to chat.",Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
How can you tell--,You want me to touch you? It's your private place. You're chewing nicotine gum which causes dehydration which causes wear and tear. Try a lubricant or foreplay if you're cheap.,"Stuart, wed love to help you out, but this a bad time, were about to have a baby."
"Just take a swab and get it tested, ok?","Sorry, already met this month's quota of useless tests for stubborn idiots. He pops a vicodin","Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first."
He pops a vicodin You're rude.,"Wow, you're like a... detective or something.",Dont be so hard on him.
"And you're smart, and you're funny but you are bitter. He starts pulling up his pants And you're lonely, so you treat Everyone around like they're idiots and you get away with it because of your cane.","Please stop, it's hard to write through the haze of bitter tears.","You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it."
"But you're not actually getting away with it. Last nurse you made fun of, she pRobably slipped some crap into your coffee.","Nyeah, I asked for decrappinated coffee.",She was never my nurse.
"Treat people like jerks, you get treated like a jerk. Thank you.",Bend over. Tritter smiles like it's a joke,My mother always told me to be kind to strangers.
You're kidding me.,"If you have an infection, you'd have a fEver.","Oh, youre kidding me!"
"If you have an infection, you'd have a fEver. You're chewing nicotine gum which messes with the weather in your mouth so I need to he shows the thermometer vacation elsewhere.","And wait 'til I put the thermometer in. Tritter tries to look back to see what House is doing Uh uh, you break it, you bought it.","Oh. No, no. Were not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together."
"And wait 'til I put the thermometer in. Tritter tries to look back to see what House is doing Uh uh, you break it, you bought it.",Leaving early today.,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
We should switch her to a different antibiotic.,Why?,"Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one!"
We can't treat the salmonella unless--,Salmonella? That was a total stretch.,"Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket."
"Man, why does that sound so familiar? You think it's 'coz I said it an hour ago?","Then it was a dumb thing to say, now it's smart.",Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Stick test was negative for peanuts.,That's because you foolishly tested her while she was lying down.,"This granola bar, theres peanuts in it."
"Exercise-based anaphylaxis? Think that requires exercise. When her throat closed they'd just got done eating, not Even competitive eating.",And getting Robbed. Always gets my heart rate up. Give her the same food she ate at the diner and stick her on the treadmill.,"Well then, its all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and Ill watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point its more like Doctor Why Bother."
"Better yet put a gun to her head, threaten to rape her.",You don't think I'm going to get a response?,Do not threaten her!
You don't think I'm going to get a response? No.,"You're on, 50 bucks.","No, I expect not."
I'm not betting on a Patient's--,A hundred bucks? If you say so. He walks into a room and Chase and Foreman exchange a look before walking off together,How did you get through the Wall?
"He's as sick as she is, now.",Told you it would work.,You know she has it out for him now.
It worked on the wrong Patient.,We can spend all day arguing right and wrong. Give me the hundred bucks.,"Oh, of course, it only works on the weakminded."
We didn't bet!,We could spend all day arguing whether we bet or not. Give me the hundred bucks.,Kings and queens never bet on the games.
"pays up as they enter the locker room Husband's test showed no MI. No aortic dissection. It's not his heart, it's just nonspecific chest and abdominal pain.","So, psychosomatic? Panic attack? House takes Cameron's stethoscope and begins to break into a locker.","Ok. BillyBob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, hes out for the year..."
Pain persisted after he got Lorazepam and morphine. Whose locker is that?,"Mine. Chest, stomach, throat. What does it all mean?",Its like The Hurt Locker!
We're in the nurses' locker room!,"I know that. The locker opens. Oh, that is so annoying! Wilson's girlfriend's left her stuff in my locker again.","Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, thats so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God its just such a small world!"
"Great, I hadn't committed any felonies yet today.","Relax, you know they're going to blame!","Let me guess, Ive been pardoned."
"House, you wanna mess with Wilson, no pRoblem. But you've got no reason to screw around with",Can we get back to the medicine?,"Dwight, I dont think hes going to hurt anybody."
"Okay. Why assume one disease? His chest, her throat.",So it's just a coincidence that they both got crippling stomach pains.,Do you think its really Tyrion?
It means you're insane! Wilson's not dating her.,You feeling luckier?,"Ya know, in crazy world, that means youre married."
It doesn't matter what I answer?,Two hundred it is.,"What, because thats your answer to everything?"
"If they're married and caught the same disease, then it means they",Aha! Brochure to a jazz festival in the Poconos this weekend.,And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?
"Wilson likes jazz. Foreman, pay the Man.","Four, five, six novels, no music. What does that mean?",Theres nothing classier than boring Jazz music.
What does that mean? She's literate.,"It means she spends her time reading, not listening.",She even reads for pleasure!
"Married couple. Same disease. They either got it from each other, or in the same place.",Infectious or environmental.,Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
Good. Then I'm sure you'll have no pRoblem convincing House.,That cheating bastard!,Well then if I could just convince.
He loves her!,"Right, I bet he told you that she's the love of his life.","Oh, hes really good with her."
"People lie, I get it, but they don't go up against two armed gunmen to save someone unless",There's a reason that we don't let kids vote or drink or work in the salt mines.,"Yeah I told you, you cant shoot people."
"Gonorrhea explains all their symptoms. Fitz-Hugh Curtis syndrome for her belly pain, Costochondritis and bladder infection for his chest and abdominal pain.","Good. Now go rub their lying, cheating privates with a cotton swab.","Oh, ahh, go to the window."
"No scarring, no purulent discharge, and the NATs were negative. They don't have an STD.","What's that, you say? You have a pRoblem with interracial couples?","$5,000 for a couple of dolls?"
"Thank you, Chase.",No! Haven't any of your shorties Ever been whities?,But what are you gonna do about that?
"Not sure I understand your ghetto slang, Dr. House. How Many black women have you dated, by the way?",I don't care about color. As long as they can help me breed a superior race.,Wow. So how many girls have you met?
"Yeah, my exes have usually been black, so what? It's not a racial thing, it's cultural. I have more in common with them, like I assume you only date emotionally stunted bigots.","Sorry, you're right. That kind of prejudice is totally fine.",Well maybe youre going about this the wrong way.
The abdominal pain's getting worse. We've had to up their morphine twice.,"Take the wife off the steroids. If she spikes a fEver, we'll know it's an infection. If she doesn't, it's environmental.","The years punish us as well, I promise you that."
"Take the wife off the steroids. If she spikes a fEver, we'll know it's an infection. If she doesn't, it's environmental.",He got off easy. I almost gave him a colonoscopy.,"It doesnt matter, thats where it all went to hell."
"That was one of the stupidest things you have Ever done, and there is heavy competition for House is rifling around in something. What are you doing?","Hmm, only ate half your breakfast. Feeling a little sick this morning?",And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?
"I'm not pregnant, they burnt my omelet. You need to apologize to this guy.",I'm a Man of principle. I don't care how much time and money it costs you to defend me.,Well find another time to tell him Im pregnant.
He wants to kill you.,No empty coffee cups. Off the caffeine. Good for baby.,"Hes trying to kill me, Leonard."
"Cup's in the other wastebasket, baby's in your mind! You can berate Patients all you want. Shoving objects into their rectums is assault. Pay attention to me.","Sorry, that would make it harder to ignore you. Can't ignore that rapidly expanding first trimester ass, though.","What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you cant do it at a doctors office?"
Or tumors or anything.,"You add brain involvement to the chest, stomach, throat, what've you got?","You know, that doesnt work for me, lets stay with Mrs."
"Didn't spike a fEver when we took her off the steroids, so it's not an infection.",Leaving environmental. What flavor?,"Kings Landing, the Small Council chamber."
"Environmental doesn't make sense, either. If it were toxin, we'd see it in their livers. None of their neighbors are sick, no coworkers","They both got it, meaning it's infection or environmental, and since it's not an infection!","As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, lets give them some privacy."
What if they didn't both get it? Maybe we got our basic assumption wrong and it's two different diseases?,Maybe we didn't and it's sarcoidosis.,"You know what guys, why dont we just chill out on this herpchat."
Sarcoidosis isn't infectious or environmental.,Tell that to the clusters of sarcoidosis cases.,"The climate? Youre free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
I did see these two putting out that blaze in the Pine Barrens.,"If sarcoidosis has two environmental causes, it has environmental causes.",Thats what I saw in the fire.
It doesn't explain his throat swelling.,That's what 'almost' means.,"Well, that doesnt make sense, either."
90% of sarcoidosis cases have lung scarring.,"Oh, 90%?",Where did you get that scar?
"Oh, 90%? Oh, almost.","Fine, I'll consult a specialist. He climbs over the balcony wall and into Wilson's office.",Five eightyeight plus fifteen percent Oh no.
If this is more dating advice!,"Love to gossip, but I've got work to do. Is this sarcoidosis?","Then, this is my first date."
"It's pretty nonspecific. Could be granulomas, could be plaques. What's this? Oh, oh, you stole Wendy's personnel file?!","In a way, aren't we all guilty of bribing the janitor of taking the file and giving it to me?",And it is so cute how she signs her name.
"First of all, I am not dating her.","She is so wrong for you. You know, she filed a form so the hospital would take extra withholding. Who does that?","Well, yknow, I never know how much to tip."
"She's much too cautious for me. Point taken, I'll start dating her so I can break up with her and start dating a stripper. You're a miserable jerk who can't stand to be alone.",I didn't try to break up your marriages you did that yourself.,"Hey, you dont think Im pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?"
My marriages were so crappy I was spending all my time with you. Your real fear is me having a good relationship.,"Yes, that keeps me up at night.",Marriage is scary.
You don't! no. I don't think it's sarcoidosis. House walks back.,He says it's sarcoidosis. Start them both on methotrexate.,I think Stanley just coughed.
And if you're wrong?,If Wilson's wrong. We'll biopsy her just to be sure.,"Oh! If Im wrong, prove it."
"The brain stem? Brain damage is not only possible, it's likely!","Good point. Let's biopsy something safer, like her shoes.","Excuse me, but the problem is not solved."
"The husband, he'd have to give consent. He can't right now.",Why? This guy write with his stomach?,"Well, what if its one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because hes afraid of being alone?"
"He has a conflict of interest. It's not his brain we're cutting open, but he's getting all the benefit. He'd do it just to save himself.","Or to save her. She's the love of his life, remember?","I just talked him into it, dont tell me I have to do you too."
She needs a guardian ad litem. I can't let you do this.,How're you going to stop me? Call Cuddy?,And she never will be.
"Cameron's right, there's a conflict.","No, there isn't! Not unless one of them wants to die a horrible, painful death.",Its just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
I'm sure the guardian will figure that out.,In a couple days! Will the guardian convince the disease to hold off eating her brain until we can get the legalities worked out?,"I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father."
"I just don't want some plaintiff's Lawyer owning my hospital. Legalities help. Speaking of which, did you get your thermometer back yet?","Uh, we had a nice chat. Did you know he's a Rotarian? Listen, she'll die without the biopsy.","No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel."
"I need to cover the hospital's ass. You're too biased. I send you in there, you'll steamroll over him. Something goes wrong, he'll sue us for not disclosing the risks.","Then have Wilson talk to the husband. Wilson kills people left and right, no one Ever sues him.","All right, Im nine years old."
"Fine, but only if you apologize to the clinic guy.","Nah, pRobably better to just let that couple die.","Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick."
Then stop treating me.,Great job. Why don't you just shoot him in the head?,"Its just that before, you said that you didnt want any special treatment."
"Hold on, that gives me an idea. You know what could save this couple, lots of misdirected sarcasm.",They're dead. Yelling at you might prEvent you from screwing up like this --,"So theyre both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad?"
I didn't screw up. I did my job!,Your job was to get me the biopsy.,"You dont make a mistake on purpose, Toby!"
"No, it was to present the Patient with his options.","Two options biopsy or no biopsy. He chose the third, no treatment. How do you Even do that?",No. Just for the middle part. Cause at the end I assumed thered be nurses.
Remember when you used to just weave elaborate conspiracy theories about my love life? Those were such good times.,How much morphine is the husband on?,Oh God. Remember the girls nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
"We can't increase it any more, his respirations are depressed.","Decrease it! Drugs cloud people's Judgement. Cold turkey, you sucker.",But I think we should tell her.
"Cold turkey, you sucker. Uh, no.",Good point.,You know what?
"Uh, no. Good point.",Did I ask you guys to follow me?,Thats a good point.
"No, which made us nervous.",They'll catch on if they notice that he's off the morphine drip. Shoot him up with one of these puppies instead.,Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?
Shoot him up with one of these puppies instead. No!,You do understand it's not really a puppy.,So I should kill him?
"An opiate blocker? It'll feel like he's swallowing a bonfire. That's pretty unethical, Even for you.",How is that unethical? It'll lead to a diagnosis!,"Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing."
It's leading to the torture of the husband on the off chance he'll allow a procedure on another person!,"Which will lead to a diagnosis, didn't I just say that?","I think its totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital."
"Give it up. Foreman and Cameron are too ethical, and I'm too scared of getting sued.","Fine. Now I'm just going to find someplace safe to hide this, where I won't be tempted to use it.","Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?"
"You're not doing it, either. What, you're gonna run for it?","If they die now, they'll nEver be able to grow old and tired of each other. He hands the meds to Foreman and leaves.","No. I mean, Ill apply, but Im not gonna stoop to playing politics."
That's actually pretty clEver.,"Guess I can't use that trick again, huh? Foreman tries to open the cart, but it's all locked up.","Youre a clever man, but youre not half as clever as you think you are."
"Oh! Ow, my stomach, ow!","It's a pretty smart plan, Jerry, but I'm on to you.","Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"You poisoned your wife, and don't want the coppers to get wise. No!",Oh. Then you're just a moron!,Over the course of this documentary Ive had three affairs.
Then you're just a moron! Biopsy me!,"Only if this thing hits your brain, you moron! I can't stress that moron thing enough. You're killing your wife!",I could perform an operation on you and prove it if youd like.
She is the love of my life!,Careful.,"Yesyesyes! But, II do not love her."
"No, it won't. The morphine just isn't working right now for some reason. I'm putting you on a tranquilizer in the mean time. It'll work again soon.",Wanna bet?,"Oh, no, it will."
"I don't care about the pain. I need to be in pain, so I can get worse. That means you can do the biopsy on me!","Dude, she's in a coma. Who're you trying to impress?","Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isnt good for us."
I was just going to call you.,I need a court order to biopsy this Woman's brain.,Im just gonna call you back.
I don't want to sue you.,Good.,"Look, you dont want to fight me."
I want to beat the crap out of you.,Less good.,I want to hit you.
"I'll tell you why. You're a bully. And bullies, they don't back down until they run into someone stronger and meaner.",But you'll accept an apology.,Im not a bully.
But you'll accept an apology. Yes.,Not really a recipe for sincerity.,Apology not... accepted. Because it wasnt even necessary in the first place.
I'm not looking for sincerity. I'm looking for humiliation. Something that will make you think twice before you treat the next Patient like crap.,"Here's what's gonna happen you go brag to your friends about how you made the big, nasty doctor go poop in his pants, I get Cuddy off my back by telling her I humiliated myself, here's the catch we're both gonna be lying.","Wait, you cant have the baby here!"
What's wrong? Jeremy's worse.,Then that's what's right. You cut the stubborn jerk's head open and take a slice.,"Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him."
This isn't sarcoidosis.,"He'll get his wish. He's dying, just not in a way that's going to help his wife.","I dont know, you see somethin, you hear a word, I thought thats what it was."
He's got ischemic bowel.,So what?,"Im a big boy, and if I missed one, Id throw a bigboy tantrum."
"Well, let's see. Lack of blood flow's causing his guts to die, which will cause him to die unless we cut out a few feet of small intestine and reattach the ends. I don't know, seems like a match.",Why does he have it? What does it tell us?,"Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, theres going to be a good amount of blood. Dont let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers."
Small cell vasculitis?,"Good. Now, let's hear it again, but now with a more environmental or infectious feeling.","Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!"
"Or, like I said before, it might not be environmental or infectious. He has vasculitis, she has porphyria. Belly pain plus hallucinations, classic symptoms. Can Even cause a coma.",Fine. Start her on hematin for porphyria.,Hes going through a breakup.
What about him?,"Take out the dead bowel, it's all we can do. And biopsy it. If Foreman's right, it might save him. If Foreman's wrong, it might save both of them.",Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
The bowel's not dead.,"Unless he's been tossing down cans of frosty lactic acid, the bowel is dead. What we're looking for is a reason it's dead.","You know thats nice, yknow we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!"
The bowel's not dead. Just general swelling and edema. The high lactate was pRobably from stress. We just sliced him open from chest to pubic bone for nothing.,Nothing's something. Forget the isochemia. Add the edema and swelling.,"So, does your dad still live in Texas?"
PRobably from cutting him open.,"PRobably, not definitely. Okay, back to the beginning. What did we talk about? Anything, I want to hear it all again.",What the seven hells could do that to a man?
He wasn't cheating on her.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Love of his life. Don't you have to wait 'till he's dead to make that determination?","If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal."
She's his only girlfriend Ever. They grew up next door. They ran off together as teenagers. Sarcoidosis. We only ruled it out because we thought he had isochemic,Why did they run off?,Better theory. This is her exboyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
What difference does it,"Kids talk about running off, not Many do it. What was the reason?",How does it different from the money I have?
"They were trying to escape his evil, pill-popping, racist dad. You would have liked him. We should do another biopsy.",How'd you know the dad was racist?,What happened to their fathers?
He beat up his son for dating a black girl. Extrapolated from that,You see racism Everywhere. Maybe he just didn't like this black girl.,Im given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
It's not sarcoid. We would have seen granulomas in,"She has pretty eyes. Forget infectious. Forget environmental. Defective DNA is keeping them from making a critical protein, hence the fluid build-up. Hits the throat, stomach, chest, and brain.","I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff."
"Hits the throat, stomach, chest, and brain. Angioedema?",Hereditary Angioedema. Symptoms fit perfectly.,Forgive me.
It's an incredibly rare disease. They would both have to have a parent,"Is it a coincidence that your sister has great hair, or that these two have green eyes?","Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch."
You're not saying! they're not brother and sister?,"Ew, God, no!",I dont believe theyre brother and sister.
You won't know for sure,Test them for HAE or paternity. It's going to take a day. She doesn't have a day. Start treating and see what happens.,Can we please stop talking about poodles?
"Tracy, Tracy, she's awake. Oh God, baby, it's going to be okay.","Awesome, can I tell them?","Pam! Whoa, whoa, Im sorry, Im sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. Im getting a call."
"We've obviously got to let them know what's wrong, but the cause, the brother-sister thing!","Good plan. You've just got to keep them away from doctors, the internet, and anyone who's not a total moron.","Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?"
Yesterday he was willing to die to save her. You've got to give him time to recover,He might be a little vexed that you kept letting him hump his sister in the mean time.,"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now."
"Unless their dad was also the product of an incestuous union, the chances of serious complications are minimal.","Noble of you to take that risk. Tell them, or I will.","Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course."
I'm going out of town.,"Where are you going? no answer Foreman, you're not missing a blue shoe, are you? Com you can't bet when you know the answer beforehand!",Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
We can spend all day arguing whether you can bet when you know the answer beforehand. Give me the two hundred bucks.,"What? Foreman leaves, and meets up with Wendy in the hallway.","Im talking about a bet, winner takes all."
She just needs some time alone. You want me to hang out here a bit? Jeremy nods tearfully.,"If you've come to return the thermometer, don't bother. I've moved on.","Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk."
"If you'd actually read my chart, you'd know that I'm a cop. You were going 40 in a 25 zone.","Oh, come on. This isn't because I was speeding, it's because I'm Latino.","Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?"
"License, registration, proof of insurance.","Sorry, cool jacket. Only pockets for important stuff.",What do you need from the car?
That's a shame.,"50 buck ticket. Is that your way of beating me up, or is that the price for sticking something in you?","Gods be good, youll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
"You took a pill while examining a Patient, that's serious addictive behavior. I'm betting that you're holding right now.","I wasn't weaving, I'm not drunk, you've got no reason to",I still dont understand why you bought that pill caddie.
"Pupils dilated, appear to be under the influence of a narcotic. Would you mind turning around, please, and putting your hands behind your head?",Does that polite crap Ever work on people? Tritter grabs him and does the above for him.,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
Most people realize that there's only one answer. He reaches into a pocket and finds some Vicodin. Got a prescription?,I'm a cripple who works in a hospital. You don't think I've got a valid prescription?,"Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think youve made a foolish mistake."
"Have my baby, what a lovely way to say how much you love me...",Excusez-moi garon!,Tell my son that I love him.
I think you mean Barney Fife.,So Many great idiot icons to choose from.,Im not saying you have to be Barney.
You need time to think of some more?,Either arraign me or let me go.,I said I needed time to think.
"No pRoblem, which do you prefer?",What took you so long?,Yeah. Which one do you like more?
"Sorry, I didn't have 15 grand in my loose change jar. What the hell did you do? He takes a bottle of vicodin out of his pocket and hands it to House.",Nothing. He takes a vicodin.,All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
"The motorcycle was impounded, that explains the speeding, DUI and driving without a license. The fact that you're you explains the illegal possession of narcotics and resisting arrest.",Where's your car?,"Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects."
Where's your car? What happened?!,Some idiot cop with crotch rot obviously thought that I didn't treat him with the deference due to a Man of his stature.,"So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight."
Does Cuddy know?,I don't think she needs to. Wilson looks at him and he shrugs. I'm innocent!,I would think he would know that.
Til proven guilty.,"The guy wanted to punish me, he did it. It's over.",Until theyve made their intentions known.
Better get yourself a Lawyer.,I already got one.,"Well, its your word against mine see you in court."
You know what they say about the Lawyer who has himself as a client?,Same thing they say about the doctor who lends 15 grand to a friend he knows can't pay him back.,"You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire SheHulk."
"But I have seen how Many pills he's been popping lately, I wouldn't be surprised if he's in a coma somewhere himself.","If I am, this is one lame hallucination.",Hes probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie.
What happened to you?,"If you Ever end up in a bar with a Cambridge Woman's heavyweight eight, do not accept the offer of an upside-down kamikaze shot.",Okay. Good night.
We have a case.,"Fat guy in a coma, I know.",I could get us a complaint.
Cuddy found you?,"Nope, but the wall between Wilson's office and this one is thinner than you think which means we need to stop talking about what a pathetic loser he is.","Dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, them were gonna go over to Joeys and search, OK?"
CO2 and oxygen stats are normal.,"For you and me, what's normal for a hippopotamus? Cameron gives him a look, Foreman looks annoyed. Get a detailed medical history.","I got a look at the centrifuge theyre going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light."
And I doubt a guy who weighs 600 pounds bothers with annual physicals.,"Talk to the neighbors, search the House.",Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
"It's usually worse in the morning. Especially if I've slept on my arm. He's massaging his shoulder as he talks to House. If I sleep on my back or you know, with my arms out, I'm usually ok.",So your arm only hurts after you lie on top of it all night.,"Yknow I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over"
So your arm only hurts after you lie on top of it all night. Yeah.,"Hmm. Well have you thought about, I don't know, not doing that?",Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.
"Yeah, but it's how I sleep. It's how I've always slept.",Well there's always surgery.,"Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed."
To do what? Like clean out some cartilage or something?,You're not sleeping on some cartilage you're sleeping on your arm.,"Yes, but, only to clean."
You wanna remove my arm?,"Well it is your left, a guy's gotta sleep.","Ive come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady."
I see spending a night in jail hasn't humbled you a bit.,"While following my Every move is flattering, a single rose on my doorstep each morning would be more enticing.",It grieves me youve less honor than a back alley whore.
Just bringing your boss up to speed which I guess you didn't feel was necessary. He takes out some more gum and puts it in his mouth.,You going to add that to my list of charges? He takes out a vicodin and swallows it.,"Its just his way of saying, Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting."
People who are innocent tend not to try to hide their arrest.,Is that based on your years of experience arresting innocent people?,"When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, shed ask one question What do we do when we find the guilty party?"
Foreman and Cameron walk in to find House. Who's that?,Apparently Cuddy's widened her sperm donor search to include Neanderthals.,"Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joeys apartment."
Cuddy's looking for a sperm donor?,"It's a joke. Like Cuddy would Ever want a kid. Or a kid would Ever want Cuddy. Hello, that's why it's funny! Why are you guys here?","Yeah, if hes in the room when theyre making the baby, Ill give you ten dollars."
It's not Pickwick's. Intubation and steroids have had no effect. Except maybe to cause whatEver it is to get worse he's got a fEver now.,He turns to Cameron. What'd you find out?,Its not his men that worry me.
That you and George have the same taste in home furnishings and women.,Danish modern and Russian gymnasts?,That you and daddy were not on a break.
"Pianos and prostitutes. We should do an LP, look for neurosyphilis.",It's not syphilis.,Maybe we could switch instruments.
How do you know?,Because you get STDs from people you trust.,Ezel! Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
Weight limit on the MRI maParkne is 450 pounds.,So do a CT.,185 pounder. Check it out. Whew!
So do a CT. Limit's 350.,Then just start treatment.,I thought it was 500.
We give him blood thinners and the coma's caused by a bleed instead of a clot we'd kill him.,Either start treatment or start building a stronger MRI.,"Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up postapocalypse?"
Here. She hands him a piece of paper.,What's this?,"Uh, its a piece of paper and it says, Ross on it."
Shifting House's feet so she can sit down next to them. I made some calls for you. The guy's the best criminal attorney in Princeton.,Thanks but I don't need it. I assume you told Inspector Clouseau that I have a valid prescription for the vicodin?,"How can she protect the family, if shes not with her family?"
"Yeah, and I assume you did as well did it make a difference? The guy's pissed, and with the DEA now treating pain doctors like Columbian--","I'm not a pain doctor, I'm a pain Patient.","Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, Im pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. Youre not really considering working for him, are you?"
"It was pRobably just some sort of head trauma and we missed the swelling because, well, his head's already swollen.",Bump on the noggin doesn't explain the fEver.,Probably went to his head.
We just replaced the last MRI you broke.,Referring to the fund-raising funbags by the royal 'We' now?,"Oh. That was... lets see, wheres my replacement? Wheres the guy Im replacing? Why dont I look to the left? Hes sitting right there!"
Let me explain cause and effect to you.,I specifically told them to skip the boring testing part and jump right to the dangerous treatment.,I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
He's telling the truth. Everyone looks up at Cameron.,Shrugs. Kids these days - got no respect for other people's property.,"Hes not lying, he does find that fascinating."
This was your idea? Yeah.,Looks like Cameron is going to be having a lot more ideas in future. Who knew that being bloated and bitchy could actually come in handy?,"Yeah, and I dont wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine!"
"We should do nothing. Just keep him a couple of days for observation, if he doesn't get any worse it was pRobably just a hematoma that dissipated on its own.",Or we do all of the above.,"Hi, listen, Im sorry about before."
"And now that you have, when can I go?","It's pRobably her mom, I bet she's huge. She's from the Midwest. Looks at the salad. Since when did you eat beets?","Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought youd be here... certainly didnt expect you to be out working."
"Since I was 5? And who are we talking about? You know, just in case you need me to Parkme in and tell you you're a lunatic at some point.",Picks a cherry tomato from the salad and pops it into his mouth.,"And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?"
Yeah you definitely better get to the bottom of that. I heard Cuddy gave you the name of a Lawyer.,"Or it could just be pity, she feels guilty about being born beautiful so she overcompensates by being nice to ugly people.","Well, you must have someone in your family thats a lawyer."
"From what I hear the Patient reminds her of you, not me. Call the Lawyer.",Cameron sees a clump of dirt and she thinks of me.,"If like the four of us could all yknow, hang out together."
"Or a lump of something else, you're a lunatic, call the Lawyer. Very mature.",You started it.,I dont care.
"Skin exam and ACTH stimulation test were both normal. He has nystagmus, but it's congenital no way it's related to the coma. He hands House a sheet of the results.","You say no way I say! yeah, no way.",How does he sleep with no eyelids?
"Blood and urine were negative for ChlAmydia, Herpes and Syphilis.",In his Southern accent. Looks like we got ourselves a mystery.,"If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
"Not for long, he wants to be discharged.","Oh sure. Places to go, people to eat.",If he ever gets out.
He insisted chance of dying from hospital acquired infection is greater than him dying from whatEver caused his coma.,Did you tell him that statistics also say he's a big fat idiot?,He said it was a matter of life and death.
Selectively rational? Stubborn? Uncooperative? Maybe you ought to check his leg.,Bursts out in sudden mocking laughter.,Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man Ive ever met.
"Bursts out in sudden mocking laughter. You see what he did there? The Patient's like me, the Patient's three me's. If I were him-- House suddenly gets a thoughtful look. Maybe it's not such a mystery after all.",Enjoying your Salisbury steak?,"You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were."
Putting chopped parsley on a hamburger does not a Salisbury steak make. You must be doctor House.,And you must be full of baloney. A lot of it.,"Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?"
"Laughs. Right, fat joke, always fun. Only people you can still make fun of.",And Christians.,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
"You figure, I'm fat therefore I hate myself.",That's a huge leap of logic.,"Yeah, but why are you fat?"
I don't wanna die I just don't wanna be here.,Then it's a condition you've already had diagnosed or it's something you know you've inherited.,I believe I want to go home.
My parents are both alive and well and living in Boca Raton.,Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?,"How about your grandparents, they alive?"
I have no idea what that is.,Leukoencephalopathy?,Are you sure you know what that is?
"Angrily throws his cutlery onto the tray. Will you stop? If I knew what was wrong, I would tell you. I'm not an imbecile, and I'm not miserable. I'm just overweight.","Mobile rings, he picks up. What? When? He puts it down. To be continued.","Pity food? Yknow what thats okay, all right, I dont need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays."
"Mobile rings, he picks up. What? When? He puts it down. To be continued.",What are you doing here?,"Then I look down, and I realize theres a phone."
"When you err! when you got bailed out, before we could get a Judge to approve this He holds up a search warrant and takes the evidence bag. I almost didn't bother. I thought for sure you'd come straight home and throw Everything out. Rookie mistake nEver underestimate the stupidity of an addict. There's got to be over 600 vicodin in here which most DA's would say proves intent to traffic. Even if all you'd really intended was simply to be wasted 24/7 while practicing medicine.","In case you hadn't noticed, those are prescription bottles.",I am ridiculously antidrug.
Shakes the evidence bag and listens to the pills rattle in the bottles. All these were legally prescribed to a Man who's in constant pain but nEver misses a day at work?,Ever occurred to you that's why I don't miss a day?,"God, this is so sad."
"Now maybe just a few of these are in someone else's name. Forged prescription. Just swiped from the pharmacy when nobody's looking. He steps closer to House with a smug expression on his face. You wouldn't do that, right?",Send him home.,"Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone."
"Why, you think he's healthy?","Either I'm right and he knows what's wrong, he's just too stubborn to admit it or I was right and it's Pickwick's. Treatment just had a delayed effect.","Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?"
You don't have delayed effects to oxygen. And Pickwick's doesn't explain the fEver.,Being engulfed in an electric blanket of blubber could explain the fEver.,Its not cause of the smell.
"Yesterday you insisted on keeping him here because of the fEver, we have no idea what's wrong with the guy. For all we know he could be dead in 12 hours.","He does not want our help, which means he doesn't want your help.","We didnt want him here all day, did we?"
He's obviously just rationalizing and so are you! You would nEver give up this easy if you weren't so busy dealing with your own personal pRoblems.,Finally spots Wilson at the vending maParknes. Send him home. Turns away and approaches Wilson. What'd you tell that cop?,Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?
What'd you tell that cop? Nothing.,Nothing as in nothing or as in nothing to cause him to think that I have a stash in my apartment?,The lady cop acted like shed never pulled someone over for driving too slow.
"He called to see if I prescribed the pills, I said yes, that's all.",Obviously not.,"I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance."
Obviously not. What happened?,"He searched my House, found a butt load of pills. Wilson sighs. A guy's gotta be prepared for a rainy day.","Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?"
Last I checked pharmacies are still open when it rained.,And because I nEver know when you're going to be in one of your moods and cut me off.,"Oh, I thought thats what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained."
"Oh, it's my fault.",I'm not the one who talked to the cop.,"Well, thats not your fault."
Disorientation and loss of balance could mean a neurofibromatosis.,Where's Chase?,You know what?
Dunno. Haven't seen him since you told him to sit on his ass yesterday.,Interesting. NF-2 is also inherited which means I was right.,"I dont know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
Kept saying it was Pickwick's.,"Between the first Pickwick's and the second Pickwick's, I said it was inherited. Brenda is coming out of George's room and House rather abruptly grabs the Patient file from her.","Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding."
"No, he's not.",We have a rather large piece of tempered glass that begs to differ.,Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
I tried to keep him in the wheelchair but he's tough to stop.,"Nice audible, Peyton.",I tried to stop him once.
So what do we do now?,Discharge report says he didn't eat his breakfast.,So what are you guys going to do?
It can't be Chagas' he's nEver been outside the country.,"But his stomach has, the food we eat no longer comes from America's heartland, it comes from South America's deforested jungle land where lettuce now grows and lettuce pickers now poop.","So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time."
How are we going to do that? He's too big to do an LP.,So go straight to the source.,You guys suck.
And not surprisingly there was no sign of Chagas or any other parasites in his CSF.,"So we've ruled out his parents, prostitutes, the arugula - means either--","Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs."
"I took the sample from the pre-frontal, I was nEver anywhere near his visual cortex.",Or you missed a tumor on the MRI.,"Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amys a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print."
"Not a chance, the MRI was clean.",House finally seems to have found his wallet. Mind? Foreman steps out of his way.,"Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain."
Where are you going?,To get a 400 dollar butt plug.,"Im sorry, okay."
What about George?,He's going to have to get his own. Come on let's see if we can get this thing figured out by the time we get to the elevator.,Because youve slandered me to Father before.
It could also explain his lack of concern for his health. MS can cause excessive cheerfulness.,"Yeah, he's a delight.",He can feel sadness?
"No, blood sugar and urine dipstick and hemoglobin A1C are normal.",Were normal when you tested it.,"No, youre good."
We already have a CSF sample we might as well check it for proteins and rule out MS first.,Steps in and pushes the button for the floor he wants. Agreed except for the part about doing it first.,"You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first."
Stopping the doors from closing. Where are you going?,The butt plug was my way of saying mind your own business apparently too subtle.,But what are you doing in there?
"Speeding. House taps a gavel on a spot below his knee to induce a reflex knee jerk. DUI. House continues tapping after Every charge is read out. Reckless driving, resisting arrest, possession of a class 3 narcotic and now it looks like they've added another possession with intent to traffic charge as well. They found some pills at your House.",All of which I had a prescription for.,"Two charges of loitering,"
That's a lot of pills.,"I'm in a lot of pain. This is all because some cop came into the clinic, I was rude to him. This is his way of getting back at me.",Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?
You've made it pretty easy.,"His insane reaction to a simple rectal thermometer reading, He gets a chuckle out of the Lawyer. pRobably says a lot more about his mother than it says about me.","Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you."
I'm inclined to think your particular charm may not be immediately appreciated by a jury.,I'm not interested in a plea bargain.,There are some people who have charm and some people who dont.
It's your best bet to make this go away.,"There is no this, there's a him the only thing I'm guilty of is humiliating a bully.","No, no. I will take care of it."
"What did your Lawyer say? House looks surprised. I looked up butt plug in a legal dictionary, what'd he say?",That a smile like mine can't lose. He then pulls a funny face and flashes it at both of them. What did the test say?,"Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client."
"You're right about MS, no myelin basic proteins in his CSF.",What about diabetes?,"Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy."
"Don't know, says we think only think it's diabetes because of his weight, won't let us test him.","So, you would rather be a blind invalid than admit the fact that maybe you might have a little pRoblem with overeating?","Nono, II just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself."
And you would rather let me die than consider the fact that whatEver is wrong with me has nothing to do with my weight.,I go where the symptoms tell me to go.,"Oh, Im sorry, did I insult you?"
I am not diabetic!,Grocery stores giving away medical degrees with the free turkeys now?,"I dont know, your frame, your buildwhy dont you have a glass of apple juice and tell me youre not a diabetic."
Pushes House away. Get the hell off of me!,No dessert 'til you've finished your dinner.,Move! Get out of the way!
What the hell is going on? She rushes in but is stopped by Foreman from interfering.,Just trying to force a horse to-- He suddenly notices something about George's grip and lets go.,"I just, I dont understand, I mean, howhow can she do this?"
What's going on?,"Get x-rays of his hands, then bronc him do a sputum cytology and check his CSF for anti-Hu antibodies.",Mmmhmm. Why dont you start by telling me what you got.
How are we going to get him to do all that when we can't Even get him to drink a bottle of sugar water?,Tell him that lung cancer is in no way connected to obesity.,He only stops eating when its time for a drink.
Err... you don't think he'll realize we're lying?,We're not lung cancer's got nothing to do with--,I think hed know.
I meant about him having lung cancer.,You didn't notice his fingers?,"Oh really? Well, good for him."
Shrugs. I noticed they were fat?,"Should have pissed him off. He would have grabbed you and you would have felt the bones, they're not just fat, they're clubbed.",I just think that maybe theyre eating large amounts of the day.
You were right.,So was he.,No! Sam Waterston!
"He said, c'est la vie. She walks into the room and starts playing with the BOUO ball of unknown origins - the oversized tennis ball.",He's a compliCated Man.,"Well, there is a ball."
What about you? What are you going to do about your pRoblem?,Nothing.,"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
I guess that's good.,You guess?,"Well, I guess thats something."
"No, it's good. You get to keep going like you always have.","Alright, I give up, who was it? Who in your family had the weight pRoblem?",OK. All right. No. Its good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
You think I can only care about a Patient if I know someone else who's been through the same thing?,You care for Everybody. You only lie and stand up to Cuddy for a few.,"As a matter of fact, I do."
You lie for Everybody and only care about a few.,You're avoiding the question.,"Oh right, ok um."
"I like damaged people, remember? Explains Everything I do.","Almost Everything. Cameron grins. Wasn't you, was it?","I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
Does it matter?,"Nope, but it'd be interesting.",Of course it matters.
What're you doing down here? Thought you usually have lunch with Coma Guy.,"Mouth full, wiping his hands. This is Vegetative-state Guy. Better company. To Gabe. Hey, hey, tell him about those Sherpa's you dropped acid with in St. Patrick's Cathedral.","Yeah. I am sorry hes not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair."
"Upset, loud. You stole my prescription pad and you forged my name!","Beat, then serious. What'd you tell the cop?","All right, hurry up and close the door so they cant hear us."
I lied! He'd have put you away for ten years after they took your license to practice medicine.,"Shrugs. So, Everything's good then.",Are you kidding?
Gesturing wildly. I lied! To the cops!,There is no case unless they can prove that either I got the drugs illegally or I sold them illegally.,"Pull over! Youre not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Dont make this difficult, Dwight!"
"Yeah, Tritter's just playing. He's gonna see how clEver you are and then just walk away.",Important thing is you keep prescribing the same amount of drugs to me. Or it'll look suspicious.,You think hes going to fall into your trap.
What're you doing?,Nothing. What're you doing?,You have a brother?
Nothing. What're you doing?,Parkps?,Lets start with the Warehouse.
What're you doing? Parkps?,Wanna see something really cool?,Whatre you guys doing out here?
Wanna see something really cool?,I saw you leaving last Tuesday practically tripped over two guys on your way out.,That really is something thats really cool.
"I saw you leaving last Tuesday practically tripped over two guys on your way out. But you had no pRoblem opening doors. It's called Akinetopsia. You can't see things when they move. And since you haven't been hit by a bus, I assume it's intermittent. PRobably accompanied by seizures, which made me think that I can set one off by flashing a...","God, I love this family!",I didnt trip.
He didn't report being an alcoholic either. Drinking equals falling down equals trauma equals...,Maybe it's inherited.,"Oh. Nope. Its not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk."
How did you jump to genetics? Coming over to look at the papers. From his EEG? All you got are some vaguely epileptiform waves.,"It's not his EEG. It's his father's. When it comes to cortical seizures, like father, like son.",What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
Small seizures aren't unheard of in a Patient in a vegetative state.,Similarities are interesting though.,"Yeah, these things happen."
What caused the vegetative state?,"His House burned down went back in to get his wife. Firefighters found him unconscious three feet from the bedroom, asphyxiated.","Last question. In a postapocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, reestablishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?"
Not an inherited condition.,Test his DNA. Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.,"Well, if thats the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture."
Test his DNA. Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.,Over his shoulder. Check out the home.,"Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?"
MRI and LP are both inconclusive. Infection's still possible. Tumor's less likely than...,DNA?,I said Im sorry.
Adrenomyeloneuropathy test was negative.,DNA test again. Try Unverricht-Lundborg and late-onset Lafora's.,"What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?"
Protesting. Genetic tests take forEver. You can't just keep testing him for Every inherited condition you think it might be.,"Well, not me. I'll be leaving early. But you guys can.",Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional.
He's unconscious and heading for a coma. He's at a four on the RLAS scale.,Stop all treatment.,Ill get the hospital bag.
To see if this is a reaction to our meds?,"Well, they obviously aren't helping.",Howards a complete and total ass.
"We take him off those meds, what do we put him on?",I was hoping you'd know.,Id be happy to put him under a 72hour psychiatric hold.
Or neurological or...,Genetic.,You look great.
Or neurological or... Genetic.,We need a better history.,"You know, biology?"
You're not waking Kyle. You're waking his father.,I commend your observational skills.,"Shh, youll wake Bert."
You have no reason to think any Manner of drugs will wake a Man from a coma.,Correcting.,"No see now, now I cant because uh, Im feeling too self conscious."
The amount of amphetamines alone will be dangerous. Besides whatEver the hell else you got in there.,There are reports out of South Africa about a pill that'd temporarily revive someone in a vegetative state. We've all seen Awakenings. It made me cry. I wanna cry.,"Well, no, its just, Im just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, I cant Skype it to you."
"Voice-only, pissed off. Put the syringe down.","drawling I can out draw you, mysterious stranger.",Whats up? Youre voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Mad as heck. We don't experiment on helpless Patients!,Be reasonable. There's no way this is gonna work.,Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
"Even if you woke him, it would only be for a few hours! A day! Two at the most! You're risking his life!",I'm risking getting sued. That's the only objection here.,Help me get him up.
You'll be torturing him and his family.,Good news for Legal. Only family he's got is upstairs dying.,This man is my prisoner.
Good news for Legal. Only family he's got is upstairs dying.,Whooaaaaaii!,"Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling."
"I had a paramedic ask me something similar after getting knocked out during a sporting Event, my response was numbers.",Smiling. Coolest thing Ever. Any history of seizure in your family?,"Yknow I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adams Apple, but that really hurt."
Any history of seizure in your family? No.,Liver disease?,No! The reason Im asking is that I sorta had one last night.
"No. To Cuddy. How long have I been here? Got the feeling it's uh, been a long time.",Interesting.,You guys been here long?
"Interesting. Your internal clock kept ticking. How deep does that awareness go? Pick up scraps of conversations, do you have a vague sense that the hospital administrator dresses like a trollop?",Or that the new Star Wars movies were a disappointment?,Now what Im curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
I knew I didn't make it. Sorry.,How 'bout your wife's side of the family? Any history of seizures there?,Its okay. You made it. Were fine.
Ahh! Rumor in the cafeteria was Caustic Guy was waking up Coma Guy.,"Technically, Vegetative State Guy was woken by... yeah, Caustic Guy.","Monica and Rachels, Monica and Phoebe are telling everyone about their coma guy."
"So, what happened?","Gotta get him a steak, before I can ask him anymore questions.",All right! All right! All right! We are fixing it.
He doesn't wanna talk about his son?,Didn't seem to emotionally register that his son is sick.,"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
Brain issue? He was asphyxiated. Spent ten years as asparagus. Who knows what damage is in there?,It's possible. 'Course always the simple explanation. Maybe he just doesn't like his son.,"Huh. Didnt come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
Only in your world would that be simple.,The delusion that fathering a Parkld installs a perManent geyser of unconditional love--,"Guys, this is actually really simple."
"Maybe your father's feelings were conditional, not Everyone's--","Yes. Well, of course. That would play into your roMantic vision of huMan...",My father would have liked you.
"Terms you would understand. We have an evolutionary incentive to sacrifice for our offspring, our tribe, our friends. Keep them safe.","Agrees, but... Except for all the people who don't. Everything is conditional. You just can't always anticipate the conditions.",But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory.
Then no it is. Cops have a thousand ways to make life difficult for you.,Quick! What's the kid's status? Gotta get back to our sleeper before he goes looking for the Orgasmatron.,"Well, its a problem for me, which means its a problem for you cause Im a cop."
House is a Woody Allen fan! That makes me smile.,"See, if that were rhetorical, it would mean I could just turn around and leave now, which I'm not doing. From which you should deduce...","Yes. My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation. Very, very excited. He is my protege. He is someone that I handraised, that I nurtured. Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk. And now he is also my boss. So, win/win."
Coma diet. I could make a fortune.,Vegetative State Diet. Who gave you your clothes?,Yes. And would you make it diet?
Dr. Cuddy. I guess I'll need all new ones anyway. Everything went in the fire.,"Don't worry about it. We use recyclable clothes now. Wear them once, then eat them. Your son's measles vaccination, d'you remember if he had it and what type it was?",Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
"You weren't gonna tell me, were ya? I don't need new clothes. Dr. Cuddy says my body will adjust to the drugs, and I'll be a vegetable again by tomorrow if I'm really lucky, the day after.",Yeah.,You have new clothes.
"If I got a day to live, I'm not gonna spend it in the hospital room, being grilled.","C'mon, where you gonna go? House burned down, your wife's dead. Business is sold off. The only thing you have left is down the hall, heading for a liver biopsy.","Hey. Im not going to get in the car, because I know if I do youll try to drive me to the hospital."

How far is Atlantic City from here?",You have one day to live and you want a sandwich.,"And, I came up with Atlantic City."
People on death row get a last meal.,State provides it. Who's providing for you? You got a car? Money?,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.

I'm not doing you any favors.,You'll get it back tomorrow. Two days max. Road trip.,Im not trying to trick you.
"Oh, the hell he does!",Sure!,"Oh, he does."
"Aside from the fact, he just woke up from a vegetative state the guy doesn't have a license.","How 'bout this? Cops stop us, we lie. You know how to do that. Parkps!","I just dont see why I need a drivers license, Albert Einstein never had a drivers license."
"How 'bout this? Cops stop us, we lie. You know how to do that. Parkps!","All the drugs pumping through his system right now, his reflexes are better than Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s.","BBefore I do it, if youre a cop you have tell me, right?"
It says Ipp-odd. I'm coming.,"V.O. So, let's talk about toxic exposure.","98. 99. 100. Okay, go!"
What was wrong with the old colors? I trusted brown. Do the purple ones have chocolate inside?,Limping up. Raspberry cocaine. This House that burned down. Where was it?,Dont be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out.
"Morristown, New Jersey. Listen, I really need to know about the candy, because I'm allergic to berries.",You didn't mention that.,"The Botanical Gardens, Scrantons hidden gem."
Is it significant?,"No. So, where else did you live? List Everywhere, including vacations. Start with when your wife got pregnant.","Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Suns apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."
"We lived in Jersey. Then we moved to Jersey from there, Jersey. What, are you waiting to hear about the little cottage in the Amazon, with the mosquitoes and the lead paint all over the walls?",Nodding. Yes.,"You say youre from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?"

"Well, you want answers more than I want money. Right, so, here's the game. Ask whatEver you want. But for Every question I answer, you have to answer one first.",Why would you care about anything I have to say?,"Okay, you got me there."
And pass me the Twizzlers. I'm curious.,"No, you're not.",Who wants candy?
Why would a Man's first instinct to be to drive away from the only family he's got?,Noooo!,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
"Noooo! This is no time for you to do your thing! We don't care about his state of mind, we don't care if he's happy. To Gabe. This factory of yours. What did you make?",So ask me a question.,"What are you doing here, Gabe?"

"Firm, yet unsure. No.",You've lied to the cops enough for me. Maybe I don't wanna push this 'til it breaks.,"Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late."

My daughter and I both have cartilage hair hypoplasia think you can make a pun out of that?,"Yes, but I don't want to be insensitive. Turns to Cuddy and indiCates at Maddy She's got a bit of a short fuse hasn't she?",Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonards mother.
"It's a bleb, wait in my office.","Bleb's not a diagnosis, it's an evasion.",I gotta go to work.
"We'll schedule an MRI to make sure, but a certain number of these cases are idiopathic.",Let me translate that into Tolkien for you guys - means Doctor Cuddy's got no idea why your daughter's lung suddenly popped like a balloon.,"Oh, if I were, wouldwould I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?"
You think you do?,"Give me her chart, and my pills.",I think I do.
"Give me her chart, and my pills.",Santa needs us.,"Go, Amy Farrah Fowler."
He throws the chart at Chase who looks up and we see a dark bruise on his jaw where House punched him Did you get that looked at? I'm fine.,"Great. I just admitted a cartilage hair hypoplasia dwarf, 15-yrs-old--",All right. Did he hit you?
What are you going to do?,"I thought I'd get your theories, mock them, then embrace my own. The usual.",She told us youre spending all our money on your new girlfriend.
Wilson told us he ratted.,Your choice of verb I take it?,He told on us?
"It's appropriate, he betrayed you. And you should take the deal.",Unexplained lung collapse and anaemia. Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic - Cuddy and idiop being the relevant parts of that sentence.,Nooo! Its not okay! I cant believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Can't be TB since Cuddy already ruled it out. He hands the case down to Foreman,Then you'd be just as big an idiop as her. Don't you people know your dwarfs?,Looks to me like hes the one getting the job.
"There are over 200 varieties of dwarfism, each with different medical complications you can't expect us to be intimately familiar with all of them.",The sick dwarfs sure expect you to.,What about the dwarf?
Cartilage hair hypoplasia - they have compromised immune systems.,"Gold star for Cameron, for extra credit explain to the special needs section of the class why our Patient's negative TB test is irrelevant.",The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a nonverbal signal to verify the identity of ones coconspirators.

Gets up Let's go see a dwarf about a gallium scan.,What... Whats that? Whatcha doing?
notices House scrutinising and comparing her with his cane behind her back I'm 4' 1. That's 1.5 canes in metric.,You don't look a day over 4 feet. I saw in the file that her dad was normal size.,Shes taller than all the women in my family combined.
I saw in the file that her dad was normal size. It's average-sized.,Compared to you I'm sure he was huge. Did he have a fetish or did he just fall in love with your long-legged soul?,"Pretty big? Its huge! God, this guy doesnt have a clue! Hes just walking down the street thinking, I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock! then bam! Hes a father and everythings different."
"He grew up in the circus, said I reminded him of home. Seems like you're the one with the fetish.",Certainly curious about the logistics. Did you stand on a table?,He said he liked that!
I'm just trying to be helpful. She does slide over a stool and Abigail climbs on to the table,She also hates Jews.,"She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her halfabody across the floor, just looking for legs to steal."
"I've dealt with worse. Being different, you get used to people's idiocy. She throws that word behind her shoulder and Cameron glances over for a moment insulted Still beats the hell out of actually being an idiot. House breaks into a smile again at her words What?",Care to go for a spin?,She said defensively.
"Gallium scan shows no bright spots of any kind, means it's not TB or any other infection.",There are no bright spots because the whole thing is too bright. Except for the liver.,Its midrecession in a depressed area of a faltering state and Ive got the most expensive house on the market.
"Could be lung cancer. Tumour causes structural damage, lung caves in on itself, also explains the anaemia.",Doesn't explain the liver pRoblem though.,"I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, Im sure that youre the same with your doodles."
"Her lung collapsed, there is no liver pRoblem.",Did you guys look at the liver on this thing?,"So I think all we need is a resume, and well be good right?"
There's no liver pRoblem.,"Seriously, look at the liver.",Beric Dondarrion?
There's nothing there.,Why not?,Theres nothing down here.
Because there's nothing wrong?,Every organ in the scan is lit up like a hundred watt bulb except for her liver which is hovering around 60 watts.,"All right, you know what, I will tell you why its wrong"
You saying her liver's shutting down because the lighting is off? You just don't want a cancer diagnosis because then you'd have to deal with Wilson.,Lung cancer is a lame diagnosis. Avoiding Wilson is an added bonus.,Is the trick making him disappear?
"House, we need to talk.",Not taking the deal. Glad we talked. Ultrasound her liver. The ducklings make to take off,We need to talk about redecorating this place.
The ducklings make to take off Sit down.,Stand up. Looks to Cuddy Your turn.,Step away from the duck.
"House, you're off the case. Your treatment privileges are suspended until you accept Tritter's deal.",Well I'm obviously not going to take the deal just so I can have the fun of treating a dwarf so I assume there's more to this threat.,So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.
I'm also cutting off your vicodin.,That could work.,Im gonna cut your throat!
I'm taking over as attending. Get an MRI of her lungs.,This is not lung cancer.,My job?
We'll find out as soon as we MRI her lungs. The ducklings file out,You're going to come begging me to save this girl long before I come begging you for pills.,"If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, Valar Morghulis."
You pretending your motives are pure is why I have a pRoblem. Where's Cuddy?,"In this drawer, it's a rescue mission. I got it under control, you can leave. He goes back to jimmying the drawer",Okay. Im not even going to ask why youre pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?
"checks outside in the clinic before walking in You were right about the liver failure, Patient had variceal bleeding which suggested cirrhosis.",I'm off the clock.,"Thats a uh, thats a tough combination."
"You predicted this, you obviously saw something.",Obviously.,"Well, we sure saw that coming."
"Liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis but it shows sclerosing cholangitis. He puts the sheet of paper of the results down on the table in front of House. House takes a glance, then ignores it Even weirder, there's no increase in alkaline phosphotates.",Hmm...,"Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by."
I take it that's where Cuddy's been keeping your pills.,"One theory, one drawer.",No! Its where you put the dirty ones!
"One theory, one drawer.",Really?,"Hey, bottom drawer."
"If that were true, more than her lungs and liver would be affected. He notices House looking at drawer and jerks his head to indiCate House should be helping him to keep a watch out for Cuddy",It will be.,I dont know.
I get why you don't want to go to rehab but only an idiot goes to prison for being stubborn.,Only an idiot stands between Ahab and his whale. Move. He opens the drawer and quickly searches but doesn't find any vicodin.,Oh God. I wouldnt last in jail Oscar. Im not like you.
"He'd have made up any story for a pill, you didn't give him anything did you? No.",Ow. There's no bruise or nothing but it really hurts.,"Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I dont mean his lap."
Unfortunately that pain and lack of bruising is typical of a zygomatic break.,"Wow, sounds bad.","Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, itll still be broken then."
"Hmm, bones are aligned properly. Which ER did you go to after the car accident?",Princeton-Plainsborough. He reaches inside his jacket to get a piece of paper Here's my discharge slip.,All right. And how did the accident occur?
"Okay, going to get you some acetaminophen with codeine.","I err... I tried that, it makes me nauseous.",Lets get you some food.
Err... there's a drug called gabapentin which is good for certain kinds of pain.,"Great, I haven't slept in days.","Oh no, I dont believe in Western medicine."
Gabapentin's not really going to help with the sleep.,Oh. Is there something else you could give me?,"If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?"
Vicodin's your best bet with sleep issues.,Thanks so much.,"If you want, I can give you some of my moms sleeping pills."
holds up a finger Unfortunately our policy forbids prescribing opiates to new Patients.,How can a clinic have a rule against relieving pain?,"Hey, if youre not happy there, Ive been looking for a new head of sales at my company."
"Just for the opiates, we find that it helps weed out drug-seekers.",You think I'm a drug-seeker?,"Yeah, its for the kids."
I'm not saying that.,Well then give me the vicodin.,I never said that.
Well then give me the vicodin. I can't.,Because you think I'm a drug-seeker?,Can I get you something to drink?
I just said I didn't.,"No, you said that the policy was to stop drug-seeking. Then you said I'm not a drug-seeker, policy doesn't apply.",I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?
"I'm sorry, that's the policy.",Gabapentin works on nerve damage you're prescribing it for a broken face! Might as well hand out band aids for a sEvered carotid!,"Nono, thats okay, apparently theres a new policy where we dont have to share everything with everybody."
You're a doctor.,Not by this clinic's definition since I'm neither a moron nor a mindless drone! The doctor quickly picks up a phone and starts dialling,"And yknow what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you."
The doctor quickly picks up a phone and starts dialling Security--,"Forget it, I'll throw myself out.",Mr. Zellners office. There is a knock on the door.
You were right the Patient's pancreas is failing.,Told you you'd come begging me for help. His voice is very rough and husky,"Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news."
Her insulin production is almost non-existent. House is about to close the door in her face when Cuddy blocks the door,"Give me my pills, or lose an arm.",The apartment. There is a knock on the door which then opens and Penny enters.
The girl is dying!,So give me my pills.,Oh my God!
Take the deal and I will.,You'd rather kill this girl than give me my pills?,"Okay, deal! Ill do whatever you say. No questions asked."
I would rather lose one Patient now than the dozens we will lose while you're in prison.,Well have fun explaining that to her itsy bitsy grieving mother. he slams the door at Cuddy,"I dont care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
He is. She signs the consent form,"He says through the door without opening it Unless you've got vicodin, go away.","Ah, and I mean, hes going out with her?"
Oh god. I don't have--,"No pills, no eggnog.","I, I dont have it."
notices House's arm through the gap in the door where he's poked his head out to talk to her What happened to your arm?,Cut myself.,Is that my arm?
"Wilson was wrong about lymphoma, kid's not losing any weight, no night sweats.",Cuddy send you?,Listen. Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
No. She doesn't trust me not to give you pills.,She right?,I dont think so.
"House, these cuts are straight in a row. You did this on purpose.","Cutting releases endorphins, endorphins reliEve pain. Can you get me some pills?","Boy, I just cant seem to get these scissors back together."
Can you get me some pills? No.,Well then you can leave.,Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why dont I just start taking my smart pills now?
No constitutional symptoms means--,"Soon as the kid gets cured, Cuddy's got no pressure to fold.",I am making a citizens arrest.
You really think she's going to fold?,"Autoimmune fits better than cancer but lupus floods kidneys, usually attacks them first. Kidneys are fine, right?","Shes made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen."
"Yeah. House, take the deal. You can survive without vicodin. After you were shot you stayed clean for months.","Yeah, only it had something to do with the absence of pain.","Nah, I dont know if I should."
Then you can rip off the bandage. She proceeds to bandage the cut up,Kid been sick lately?,"Ok, you can do this."
Got a history of ear infections.,You see Abigail's immune system is like a shy guy in a bar.,Ive always been good at anything that required balance.

And you'll go to jail.,Which makes this your last chance to do me a kindness before ruining my life forEver.,And get you the hell outta that place.

"Fine. If that's what you need, go get it.",leans close to Cuddy's ear and announces loudly He seems a lot nicer than that one from Wicca needs a daddy figure dot com.,Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
I am so tired of this. Did you know that the new nurse from cardiology is sleeping with that weird Lawyer from the board?,eating The guy with elEven fingers?,"Hey! Now, Ive been watching some tapes, hows this? Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
He has elEven fingers?,How do you not notice that?,How many fingers am I holding up?
The nurse used to be a Man.,She's not anymore?,He was a woman.
But we can't talk about that.,I thought we were.,Can we not talk about that here?
"We were supposed to talk about that. I came here to talk about that. But on the way up, I ran into Cameron. You've got a CIPA Patient.",Mmmm. Tranny nurse is more interesting.,"Whats up, Meredith?"
"Oh it's way more interesting. But instead, I've got to be your damn conscience. I'm tired of being your conscience. I don't enjoy being your conscience.",No one enjoys,"Oh, its so much more fun with you."
You're studying her....,She's actually sick.,But what have you learned about her?
Which you found out after you took her on.,"I was curious. Since I'm not a cat, that's not dangerous.","So, you knew and you brought her anyway?"
"I don't think that metaphor was designed to actually warn cats. You don't care about her illness, you care about CIPA. Which means your focus is going to be on getting your answer, not hers.",Thank you. Forewarned is forearmed.,"Smelly cat, smellly cat, its not your fault."
What do you think you're going to figure out? You think her lack of pain is somehow the answer to your pain.,I think if you'd stop talking to Cameron then right now we could be ranking nurses in order of doability.,I still dont understand why you want to put her through any more than shes already endured.
enters Need you.,What did the nerve biopsy show?,"We need you, OK?"
NEver did it.,"Well then, do it.","No, never done that either."
"Well then, do it. Can't.",Why?,"Yeah, well, then do it."
She's going to jump off the lobby balcony.,And you think I can catch her? Foreman dashes out.,"Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets."
Is my mother out of surgery yet? Not yet.,This is excellent.,Hows your mom holding up?
The paranoia seems to have dissipated but her vitals keep getting worse. She could be dead in hours.,"But if you're going to die a miserable, lingering death, pain free is the way to do it. Are we sure the fall didn't cause the paralysis?","Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour."
The paralysis caused the fall. Spine's clean. No veritable fractures or spinal cord compression.,Even better. The nuttiness and paralysis means there's definitely a neurological component.,"Yes! Carol and Susans caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and shes in a full body cast."
Could be a nerve disease.,Which is why we need to look at the nerve that you didn't biopsy.,"Its called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it."
There are other tests!,"HIV? Syphilis? She was negative for all STDs. Vascular? No, ANA was negative. Cerebral clot? No, MRI was!","I thought if I could make something so good, so pure."
Makes sense given her glucose reation was slow and her potassium is down.,Yeah. I'll check with an endocrinologist.,"Monica and Chandlers, Chandler is reading Chicken Soup for the Soul as Monica enters."
Bennett's on call.,Perfect.,"No, I just saw I missed their call."
Perfect. Nooooo.,Need a consult.,No. No! Nooo!

No. What about CPK enzymes?,"Elevated. 275. Of course, people light fires for themselves. But then they don't deny it. He's here.","Um, Im not sure, but I think the right answer here is no."
CPK isn't high enough. Potassium's what you'd expect because of the bronchodilators.,looks at her then looks skyward in exaggerated Manner Oh my God. You're not wearing a bra.,102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. Its like youre not even trying to get better.
It's not thyroid storm.,You just met him.,Are you sure?
I like him. And I like sex. Do I need to stitch a letter on my tops?,No. But it might be worth taking out an ad in the local papers.,"Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think hell have sex with you."

"You noticed he was a Shriner because of the way he parted his hair. You noticed he was a momma's boy because of the way he blinked his left eye. I'm not interested. I'm not impressed. There are only two reasons anyone would want to screw with me tonight. Either they're an altruistic, decent person who's worried about my well being. Or, they want me for themself.",You left out the third option. Evil bastard who just wants to mess with other people's happiness.,"Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and Im flattered and."
Where did you go? She's getting worse.,It's not thyroid storm. Get me a spinal nerve.,Well where Where did she go?
There are still other tests.,"She just said the girl's getting worse. You really want to wait? Drops file on his desk. Looks around, confused.",Right. Right. Ross. So whats the deal with you guys? I dont want to get in the middle of anything
"as House heads into the hall, followed by fellows We'll be risking infection. Maybe make the paralysis worse.",leaving office It is worse. We're making it worse than worse? Do the biopsy.,"Under my authority as a selfappointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned."
You could paralyze her and get no useful information.,Do the biopsy.,"Exactly. Here, here are my sure things. I blindfold her. I take her to the Houdini Museum. She chains me up..."
You're thinking peripheral neuropathy. We should take a nerve a little further away from the spine.,A little further from the truth.,The nerve huh?
"Give us a minute? Fellows leave, closing door Did you know they recently found a protein that speeds up nerve growth? Fascinating stuff. If you put that protein with the insulation from a spinal nerve, you could grow your own little garden. If that spinal nerve!","Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. If it happened to come from a person with CIPA I could grow pain-free nerves and graft them into my own leg. What an evil plan.",Just think how happy youll be in a few weeks when Ive converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
You'd have to be on immunosupressors for life. Risk of infection. Shorter life span!,"Shorter, but normal.","Yeah, Ill definitely live long enough."
Usually jealousy expresses itself by trying to destroy what someone has. You're more ambitious. You actually want to change medical fact to get this thing you!,Medical fact changes all the time.,Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
You're risking your Patient's life.,That's how medical fact changes. A doctor risks!,Never been on this side of the table before.
"To serve their Patient health, not their own.",This is medically justified.,It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have ones children enter the medical profession.

They found brain swelling. They're prepping her mother for another surgery.,"Again, so what?",So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
There are only three of you guys. She's scared.,She should be. She'll die if we don't diagnose her.,"Ah well, shes got this weird idea, that, uh, yknow, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
I can't cry. Oh. My head's killing me.,"So, what does the pain tell us?","Goddammit, why am I crying?"
"It tells us nothing. It wasn't physical pain, it was emotional.",Exactly. What were they doing when she got the headache?,"And Ive already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain."
What were they doing when she got the headache? Saying goodbye.,You said they were arguing.,Theyre having their baby!
They weren't really arguing. She was just frustrated.,What were they arguing about?,"Well, they argue all the time."
Whose fault it was.,"Peripheral neuropathy, fEver and intermittent paranoia. Lots of metabolic conditions can explain those things. But what if we add guilt?","All right, Sheldon, theres only one thing left I want you to do."
Guilt as a symptom?,Alzheimer's can cause euphoria. Pain causes depression. And B12 deficiency causes guilt along with all that other stuff.,Interesting. So youre saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
"This is pointless. If the headache was caused by the illness, it means she has a B12 deficiency. If it's just because she was sad, it's meaningless. How the hell do we test for that?","We don't. Give her a shot of B12. If she gets better, I was right.","The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
"We already did. holding chart The E.R. gave her B12 when she was admitted, part of a multivitamin supplement. Apparently she's just sad.",entering Why are you still here?,Were going to take Erica to recovery now.

"External EEG could get confused if there are multiple structural abnormalities. If we perform the EEG inside the skull, it could show us where to biopsy.",shrugs Brilliant. Go. Do.,Youre right.
hangs around I'd also like to talk to you about...,"getting up from the couch This is gonna get personal, isn't it?",Id love to talk to you about it more.
voice over Neither. Hey.,eagerly Where do we cut?,Why the voice.
We don't. I need to say something.,here we go again Something personal?,"No, we dont."
here we go again Something personal? Yeah.,And I can't leave because you got something interesting in that file.,"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."

softly But I like you.,"looks at him for a beat No, you don't. You're just reacting to the perception of my death. You need to put things in order. Fear of guilt...","Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me."
irritated Will you shut up?,See? I annoy you. Now are you gonna give me the results or are we gonna... makes a hug-and-cry gesture.,"Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?"
sighs in frustration Inter-cranial EEG showed no electrical abnormalities.,finally getting his hands on the file Which means it's autoimmune.,You mustnt call me that in front of anyone else.
No. Also showed his entire right hemisphere is brain-dead.,"So, while you guys were worried about me, half of this kid's brain died.","No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him."
He's gotten worse.,Not that much worse.,"Yeah, yeah he is the worst."
"Respiration is depressed. Seizures are increasing, one Every five minutes.","Not that much worse. He can still talk. He's left-handed, which means his speech is in the right side.","So Im thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it."
You don't know how Patrick's brain reorganized itself twenty-five years ago?,looking at a model of a brain What if the right side... is just a little dead. Maybe he has random neurons firing.,"Come on over the years none of you ever yknow, got drunk and stupid."
You're just looking for a puzzle to distract you from your own situation.,You're right. He's dead. Let's go home.,"Relax, its a hard puzzle."
I'm so sor...,emphatically Yes!,"Oh, Im terribly sor."
to House He's obviously lost the use of his...,quietly Shut up.,Hes just decided hes never leaving his apartment again.
quietly Shut up.,almost beaming Music is a global process. Can't play the piano with half a brain.,Im sorry. Im quiet. Listen how quiet I am. You can barely hear me...
What's it mean?,Means the right side of his brain has always sucked. Means it's not relevant what's going on now.,Im finding it really hard not to mess with him.
"smirks Wow, then it's autoimmune.","Yeah! Question is, what do we do about it?",Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
"'S likely ones we can fix. Polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu or sarcoid. I'll start treatment.","Not what I was talking about. But yeah, you do that.",Im going to get some fries.
"Not what I was talking about. But yeah, you do that.",without turning around Your turn?,"Yeah, you do that."
"turning around You mean, cheapen Everyone's attempt at a huMan moment by identifying the real calculations that go into it? Yeeah.",Yeah! I do. goes back to reading the magazine,That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?
getting emotional Anything to say?,"Well, if you're considering grabbing my ass, don't start anything...","Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?"
"Well, if you're considering grabbing my ass, don't start anything...",... you can't finish.,"Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass."
... you can't finish.,"As long as we're just standing here, you mind if we work? How's the kid's treatment going?","And no, oh please, oh please let me finish."
"As long as we're just standing here, you mind if we work? How's the kid's treatment going?",Are you crying?,Hows work going?
"finally letting go No. moves away, keeping his back to House Respiration rate's up. Seizures are coming down. 'S all good.",Not for what I'm gonna do next.,"No, no. The vet says unless hes in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin, hes just gonna get vicious. Ive just gotta get him into a zoo."
But there is no next. He's gonna be fine.,Only if he wants to remain a four-year-old who wets his bed.,"What? What do you mean, there you are? Where was she?"
There's nothing else for him.,There's better. Thanks for the hug. leaves,What do you want with him anyway?
It's the middle of the night. You know I'd be asleep.,Phone would have woken you up just as much. I can see what you're wearing on the phone.,But then you fall asleep and theres nothing for me to do.
Phone would have woken you up just as much. I can see what you're wearing on the phone.,closing the door My Patient with the fifty-five IQ has Takayasu syndrome. Very uncommon. Happens mostly in Asian women.,"Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside."
"Takayasu is Manageable with steroids, which you already know. So, I assume you're here for something else.",My Patient also has a significant seizure pRoblem.,"Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink."
Also Manageable with anticonvulsive medication.,"Yes. He kept taking his anticonvulsive medication, he could go back on tour and play the piano.",I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
"Yes. He kept taking his anticonvulsive medication, he could go back on tour and play the piano.",But... a hemispherectomy would completely stop the right-brain seizure activity and he would no longer need to take his anticonvulsive medication.,"Yep! Yeah. He just loved having people, communicating all the time. He was like Come on in!"
in disbelief You want to remove half his brain?,confirming The right half. It'd be irresponsible to remove the left.,Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
arguing You don't remove half a brain and gain function.,"Not my brain. But his, who knows? What? Lets say I'm the left side of Patrick's brain, I'm quick- witted, I'm charming, I'm great looking.",You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
"Not my brain. But his, who knows? What? Lets say I'm the left side of Patrick's brain, I'm quick- witted, I'm charming, I'm great looking.","You're the right side of his brain. You're useless, old, damaged.",Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybodys.

"House, I'm so sorry.","Forgot I was dying, huh?","The beach house, Joey and Chandler are sitting at the dinner table, Monica is looking in the fridge."
"I'm here, if you need me.",all right! I need you.,"If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away."
all right! I need you.,One small feel for Man. One giant ass for Mankind.,Okay. You can count on me.
much more relaxed Dr. Foreman was just here. Seizures have almost completely gone away. Says we might be able to go home in the next day or two. Thank you... so much.,like asking for change I think we should we should remove the right side of your son's brain.,I said Im sorry.
I thought you fixed him.,Does he look fixed?,Yes. Im sorry. I will fix this. Ill talk to him. Ill talk to David.
The seizures are hardly noticeable. They don't bother Patrick.,"But without the seizures, the left side would have a chance to actually function. He'll learn to do new things. Only bummer, he'll nEver play the piano again.",The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.

We did an FDA antibody test. The VDRL was a false negative. thrilled to bits You're not going to die! All you need is IV antibiotics!,"quietly, seriously Did you send these results to Mass General?","and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not."
gestures happily Of course.,pissed You... idiots.,Smilenod. Smile and nod.
unsure You knew it wasn't cancer?,I was sure it was cancer.,when I thought I had skin cancer.
Then why aren't you celebrating?,"turning around, loudly Because... it wasn't my damn file!",I dont want to celebrate.
non-plussed You faked cancer?,"The real Patient is in the Witherspoon Wing. Feel free to tell his wife he's not gonna die, but he is cheating on her.","Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz?"

in disbelief You faked cancer to get high?,I'm going to bed.,Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
You're right! I don't like you! leaves,Sure. Now that I'm not dying.,Fine. I dont like you!!
Heard Patrick's hemispherectomy went well.,"He survived the surgery. He's unconscious, but...",On how far along hes in the sex change process!

You faked... cancer.,It was an outPatient procedure. I was curious.,Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
Are you curious about heroin?,"Not since last year's Christmas party. Whoof! beat I know this goes against your nature, but can we not make too much of this?","Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, youre going to have to answer to my mother."
You made people think that you were going to die!,protesting I didn't make them! I tried to hide it! You idiots needed to get into my business.,Im sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
protesting I didn't make them! I tried to hide it! You idiots needed to get into my business.,"I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why are you laughing?",What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isnt just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Dont you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
"I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why are you laughing? It's ironic.","I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why...?",Why are you laughing?
"Depression in cancer Patients. 'S not as common as you think. It's not the dying that gets to people. It's the dying alone. The Patients with family, with friends... they tend to do okay.

So what do you do? laughs again You fake the cancer, then push the people who care away.",Because... they're boring. looks at Wilson Go home to your hotel room and laugh at that irony.,"There are five stages to grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."

switParkng off the penlight Follow my finger.,You know your name?,"What? Im moving the ink down in my pen, for work."
You know your name?,Speech centre was on the right side. It'll be a while before he's talking.,"You still dont know my name, do you?"
He hasn't really done anything except that... stare off into the distance.,nods It'll take some time to...,"Come on, Sheldon, weve hardly shown him anything."
overjoyed You buttoned your shirt?,Looks happy.,"Hang on. Its a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no."
"Up and at em, you're supposed to be in clinic duty.","Yeah, like I could sleep down there with all the crying and coughing.",Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
Hands House a file. Here. Ex-Marine. Thinks he has gulf war syndrome.,Rolls his eyes. There's no such thing.,Your father does realize were in the middle of a war?
"So he's been told, it hasn't stopped the unexplained fatigue, rashes and joint pain. And just so you know, he's the nephew of a benefactor I owe a favour, so you're going to take this case whether you like it or not.",Why wouldn't I want to take the case?,"Uh, hello, this is Ross Gellers personal physician, Dr."
You know him?,NEver met him before in my life.,I wish Id known him.
House continues to stare at the photo. That's amazing.,No it's not.,"Rachel, your house is beautiful."
No it's not. It's not?,"I can play the harmonica with my nose, make a penny come out of a Parkld's ear, or any other orifice for that matter under the right circumstances I could","Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
The right circumstance being their agreement to bill you on the same credit card.,What I absolutely cannot do is dream about someone I've nEver seen before.,Well you can split it with another credit card.
Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it can't happen.,"True, it can't happen because it can't happen!","No, you dont understand."
Flushes with his elbow. Well maybe you didn't dream about this guy specifically.,"Right, just some other guy who looks exactly like him.","Oh my God, he dreamcheated on you!"
"No, you imagined some generic Marine then you placed his face in the dream after you saw the picture. Starts to wash his hands. Sort of a coincidence mixed with a little dj vu.",There's no record of him Ever coming into the clinic so I must have seen him before somewhere else.,So do you think that my dream means anything?
"Fine, you've known him since cub scouts. The more interesting question isn't what you dreamed but why? House starts washing his hands as well. I'm guessing you're longing for either a renewed relationship with your dad or a new relationship with one of the Village People.",He was in the Navy not the Marines.,"Its interesting your father didnt help around the house and Howard doesnt help, either, so in a way, Howards not only like your father, but hes also like the child that youre afraid to have."
I thought your dad was in the Marines?,The guy in the Village People.,"Was your father a soldier, too?"
"Actually he's only in the Navy when they sang, In The Navy. The rest of the time he's just in generic fatigues. House stares at him. What? You brought it up! House starts to walk out. You didn't flush.",I didn't pee.,"Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, whos in the Navy."
I didn't pee.,"Male, 34, just got out of the Marines after 2 years in Iraq.",You didnt even stop to pee?
Why is he here instead of the VA?,Because he has a rich uncle that Cuddy is trying to avoid fellating and doesn't buy the VA's diagnosis of Nothing's-wrong-atosis. Pops a pill.,Hes right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
That's it? You beliEve her but not me?,Stick to your guns Chase. Just because there isn't a single unifying symptom doesn't mean there isn't something going on. Could just affect Everyone differently.,"Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friends wife and your own eyes over me?"
You think this guy has Gulf War Syndrome?,Course not.,Do you think hes building a bomb?
Why'd you take this case?,Because a good scientist continually questions his own theories and assumptions.,Why did you go along with that?
Cuddy's making him.,Now I'm making you.,Is Leonard coming?
Starts to walk towards his office. TV?,"Turns around. The pRoblem could be neurological, Everyone knows TV rots your brain. Continues to his office.","Leonard, the TV is in the building, weve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done."
Scoffs. What did you go to medical school in France? There's no trace of uranium in his urine. He was given the vaccines and meds 2 years ago without any allergic or adverse reactions.,Has he Ever done any modelling?,That does it.
If the lEvels are too low for us to detect they're way too low to cause any damage. House continues walking right past the office. Where you going?,Turns around. This way. Did you find out about any television or other media exposure?,"I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir."
Do you really care or are you just trying to waste hospital resources to get back at Cuddy for making you take the case?,"Of course I care, what a horrible thing to say. Do a Lexis-Nexis search and get a copy of his credit report.","Okay, listen, Im thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house."
Before or after we tell him to eat a banana and discharge him with a psych referral?,I say before.,Hang on. Should I send him away?
Are you ok?,Yea just a little too much coffee this morning.,"The pen delivery went amazing, and now Ive got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked."
Were we... walking you to the bathroom?,Sighs.,"No, were not."
"Alright. Puts her feet on the desk and leans back in the chair. Suit yourself. Looks at the screens, Chase looks contemplative.",Hits the wall.,"Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?"
What's going on? Good question.,What?,Whats going on?
"You were wrong about the nothing's-wrong-atosis, you can fake fatigue and joint pain but you can't fake bacterial vaginosis in your mouth.",Where's his mouth been?,"Sure you can, youre doing fine, its very believable."
Says he hasn't performed oral sex on anyone for over a year.,Selfish bastard.,He told me he wasnt gay.
Because he hasn't been with anyone since his last girlfriend dumped him after he deployed to Iraq the second time.,Selfish bitch. Cameron rolls her eyes.,I guess he cant get any girl he wants.
"No, his eyes and tear ducts are fine.",Who was his last girlfriend?,No dont tear out your eyes!
"Sarcastic. Yea we'll get right on that. Chronic fatigue, joint pain and opportunistic infection spells cancer, pRobably lymphoma. We should biopsy his tonsillar and subMandibular lymph nodes","Right about cancer, wrong about lymphoma.",You really want me to come back?
It's not an STD you just said...,"Just do it. Hangs up the phone, goes back to the magazine.","Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?"
Biopsy's inconclusive. I'm going to do a sialogram while we wait for the results from the additional blood work.,No hurry. PRobably nothing we can do at this point anyway.,"So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?"
Well if the cancer hasn't spread.,He's spitting stink. You should focus on the living. I need a prescription.,Why are you taking his side?
I just wrote you a prescription.,"For Vicodin, I need alfuzosin.",I got you health insurance.
No you don't. You figured out where you met your Marine?,"What? Oh that, I haven't really thought about it. I can't pee.",I think I know where he is.
You can't remember him can you?,I can't pee.,Did you just say you remember him?
So stop taking the Vicodin.,I want to pee and not be in pain.,You come so prepared.
Why don't you go to sleep?,I don't pee when I'm asleep.,Im sorry. Why cant you sleep?
Maybe you'll dream about him again and maybe he'll give you an address.,I haven't peed in three days.,"Well, yknow II dont know where he is."
I read that REM sleep is the brain's way of working out pRoblems.,"Very useful, did you hear what I just said?","Yeah, you get some sleep."
Yea you lied because you want to avoid talking about your obsession.,I'm not obsessing.,"Dont worry, dont worry."
Why don't you just ask him?,Yelling. I haven't peed in three days!,Go and ask him.
You'd be dead.,I'm not counting intermittent drips.,"You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb."
You'd be in agony.,I passed agony yesterday around 4. Pops a pill.,"Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!"
"Takes a drink of water from her bottle and starts tipping it from side to side, making a swishing noise, much to House's dismay. I think the pill is the way to go, we haven't had a condom break yet thank god, but it's bound to happen. Especially the way we've been doing it.",On a bed of nails?,"When she comes out, you hold her nose, Ill blow in her mouth, and the kid will just right out of her."
No he's not kinky. He's just insatiable. I can barely make it to any of my morning classes.,Takes a deep breath. You smoke?,"Ooh! No, no, no, no, hes not like a kook, no. Hes just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and hes so cute."
You smoke? No way.,Yelling. Stop it! Woman jumps and stops moving the bottle.,I thought you didnt smoke.
Woman jumps and stops moving the bottle. Quietly. Sorry.,Any history of hypertension? Blood clots? Strokes?,"blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle."
Nope. Besides my OCD I'm fit as a fiddle. Takes a drink of water.,You have OCD.,"Flattering, but sadly, no."
Duh. Can't you tell?,Any other compulsions besides drinking massive amounts of water?,"Im sorry, duh, what?"
No. That's it thank god. My therapist says it could be a lot worse.,You get up in the middle of the night to drink?,"No, but I did mention it to my therapist."
"Yeah, Every couple of hours.",Then your therapist is an idiot. Unconscious people don't have OCD. They can howEver have diabetes insipidus.,"Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. Youre lucky you dont taste very good. Anything broken?"
That's impossible. I eat candy all the time.,Different kind of diabetes.,You really have to say oh yeah every time you eat a candy bar?
Amazed. How'd you know?,"Easy, nice ass, no boobs, you got palms like a longshoreMan. Wait here, you need a CAT scan.",And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Oh my god.,"Don't worry, just means you'll be taking two hormone supplements instead of one.","Yeah! Okayooh, but are you going to have time to read it?"
Still no... relief?,I got relief. I just got no pee. Pops a pill.,"Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is."
If the pills didn't work you may need a catheter.,"You didn't come here to talk to me about my pee, what's going on?",Its kind of painful and my nipples are oversensitive now.
"Pulls out the CT scan and puts it on the light board. He's got cancer all right, but it's not in his salivary glands, it's in his brain. House gets up and walks over to look at the scans. And it's bad, at least 6 tumours, maybe more. He lost his hearing, his sight's pRobably next.",Death is pRobably next.,"Aw, poor Darryl."
Death is pRobably next.,No way he could've grown all these in a week.,Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
"Maybe they didn't miss them, just mixed them up. Switched his films with another Patient's by mistake.","Maybe, but it means some poor sap's getting his melon sliced in the VA for no reason.",Because the print theyre showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
This poor sergeant is going to be dead by the end of the week.,Where have you two been?,The platoon is dead!
"Lunch. Why, what happened?","Wilson's found some fast growing, illusive, or magic brain tumours. What did you find?","We were shopping, and we had lunch."
Loudly. You have them researParkng your dream?,Nope. I have them researParkng my Patient.,"Shhh! Not so loud, we dont wanna wake up, uh..."
"This poor guy's brain is riddled with tumours and you're checking his credit report? To the ducklings. C'mon, I need you guys. Starts to walk out, ducklings follow.",Where you going?,Why isnt this bothering you?
To do my job.,He's not your Patient.,To intimidate my subordinates.
How is he?,He's dead.,Isnt he good?
Shocked. Oh god.,Least he will be in a few days. Question is why? The only explanation is that the VA hospital screwed up.,Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
There was definitely no mix up I had them recheck.,"Yes, why would a government agency lie to cover up a mistake? Might've caused the death of a guy they've been trying to kill for the last two years anyway.",Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
They didn't lie House pops a pill and then a second. Did you just take two Vicodin?,"No, it was an antidepressant, I was told to take two Every time you walked into the room.","Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom."
Sighs and hands House a scan. The VA scan of his brain. No tumours.,Yes this has proved positive that someone didn't have tumours in his brain.,"No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
You paged us?,Why didn't you send his urine to Leicester like I told you?,"Okay, what page are you on?"
Because you told me not to.,Why did you choose that moment to listen to me?,Then why didnt you tell me to do that?
You think depleted uranium might have something to do with his tumours?,Radiation's the only thing that will make tumours grow that fast.,Are those Russian rockets safe?
High doses of radiation. Even if he ate depleted uranium bullets for breakfast he still would have been exposed to less radiation than we've given him in the last two days.,Do it anyway.,"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat."
No. Not until you give me a reason.,Because... I'm your boss.,No. Lets talk for a long time.
A rational reason. Or at least admit that you don't have one.,I've got a full bladder and I'm not afraid to use it.,"Okay, that is the lamest excuse you couldve possibly come up with."
But you are apparently afraid of discovering something that you can't rationally explain...,Cuts her off. SHUT UP! Do what you're told. Cuddy and Wilson may not have to listen to me but you do. Leaves.,"Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just dont."
6 tumours don't just disappear.,Unless they were nEver there to begin with.,Six? I just had it for one night. Its three.
The VA didn't screw up.,Maybe someone else did. Maybe it was Dr. Self-Righteous.,You really think we made a mistake?
Something that would cause it to show brain tissue in perfect detail but completely miss neoplastic tissue?,Then they were nEver tumours to begin with.,"I have no idea, but Xrays alone could be a couple hundred dollars."
I told you I saw...,No you saw something that looked like tumours.,"Saw what, my lady?"
That miraculously healed?,"No, they were healed by the antibiotics we're giving him for the vaginosis in his mouth.","Joey! Wow, you didnt rip off any buttons."
If it's an infection why didn't it show up in his blood work?,I don't know. Yet.,I know.
It's not the anaesthesia.,"John, John! We're going to figure out what's wrong with you, but first we need to know one thing. Have you Ever appeared in any pornos?",So what are you guys out doing today?
"John, John! We're going to figure out what's wrong with you, but first we need to know one thing. Have you Ever appeared in any pornos?","Chronic fatigue, sore throats, rashes, putrid discharge of the mouth, multiple abscesses in the brain, hearing loss and last but not least lower limb paralysis.","Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
It's got to be some sort of infection.,That's miraculously improving in his brain but getting worse in his ears and legs?,"Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing."
Could be an infection and cancer. Neoplastic syndrome could depress his immune system and cause the other symptoms.,"Mm-hmm. You're basing this theory on the negative biopsy, the lymph nodes that aren't swollen or the tumours that were nEver there to begin with?",What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isnt just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Dont you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
I was right. He's excreting depleted uranium in his urine. We should start him on an IV infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonates.,It's not depleted uranium.,Tell her about the uranium.
You're the one...,"Who asked for the test when we were thinking cancer, we no longer are.","But, um... I dont think thats going to be you."
Depleted uranium doesn't just cause cells to mutate it can cause cell death as well.,Not spinal cord cells. At least not until the dose is high enough to kill all his other cells first.,"Yeah, Ive read about that, theyre sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines."
So you're saying the radioactive uranium in his urine is irrelevant?,Sighs.,"Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant."
"Got it, we're all idiots, what's your theory?",Give me your keys.,My theory is that.
Give me your keys. Why?,"You Ever tried riding a motorcycle with a distended bladder? Wilson throws his keys to House. Keep him on antibiotics, check his hearing and paralysis Every hour. Starts to leave.","Yeah, look, and I dont want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because."
So you basically want us to do nothing?,No... I basically want to do nothing. I want you to keep him on antibiotics and check his hearing and paralysis Every hour. Continues leaving.,"Wait, so youre just going to take all the work weve done for the last year and toss us aside?"
"Wait, you can't go home now.",Actually I have to go home now. It's two days past my bedtime.,I dont want to go home.
House he needs your help.,And I need sleep. Hey it's the brain's way of working out pRoblems that the conscious mind can't solve during the day remember? Leaves.,"Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it."
No. Not yet.,"So, where were we?","No, not yet."
You have a nice night?,No. Gets rid of the remote and walks out.,So did you sleep well last night?
The paralysis is ascending. Last check it was nearly to his diaphragm.,Tells us something.,Ser Worm is stronger than he looks.
Means it's getting worse.,Worse is something.,It means they are not expanding.
Actually it tells us it's not the uranium.,Did we think it was?,They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
We started him on sodium bicarb to try and flush the uranium out of his system.,"Great, now the fact that he's getting worse tells us nothing. NEver thought it was uranium. For all we know uranium treatment is what's making him...","Well, since he wont take the bus and hes too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until Im finished with my experiment."
Sodium bicarb infusion wouldn't have any effect on...,On what? Kind of hard to say what it would have an effect on if you have no idea what's there to affect.,"No I left it on my night table your night table, by the lamp."
We had to do something.,"Well next time, go with something that has a chance of working.",You told us we had to.
Like what? Did you come up with some brilliant idea while you were warm and cosy in your bed at home?,We need more information.,"Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they?"
How much more information could you possible want? We have a medical history going all the way back to his great grandparents. A non-medical history going...,It's not enough.,What do you know about my father?
It's all we're going to get.,Want to bet?,This is all we have.
Who approved a sodium bicarb infusion?,"Don't look at me, I was home in bed.",Im confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
He was only on the sodium bicarb...,He's bleeding out.,He had Lysine but changed it.
He can't be bleeding out there's no blood in the bed.,"Fine, he's bleeding in.",Not in the same bed.
The paralysis must have reached his diaphragm he's not able to oxygenate his blood.,He's not able to oxygenate his blood because he doesn't have any left. Starts to put down Johns bed.,Stay alive! Im getting help!
There's no evidence...,The only thing that would explain...,Is there some evidence?
There's no reason for blood loss.,"There has to be a reason, he needs a transfusion.",Thats right. But I dont want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
He doesn't need a transfusion.,Nobody asked you. Puts the pillow under John's feet. In fact why are you Even here?,Youyou know about that?
Because obviously you need my help.,Get out.,Because I need your help and you need mine.
"House. Starts to walk over to House's side of the bed. His blood obviously didn't just vanish... Slips over, and notices a yellow liquid on the floor, puts his fingers in it. What the hell is this?",Looks down. Somebody must have spilled something. Goes back to what he was doing. Somebody else should be getting me four units of O negative stat.,"Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution."
"Still on the ground, notices the liquid is coming from Houses leg, lifts up House's jeans to rEveal a catheter bag with a rip in it leaking large amounts of urine onto the floor. What the hell is that?","It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it, what hell's it look like?","Im sure its a famous watering can, okay."
"It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it, what hell's it look like?",What? More and more urine pours out of the bag. It's just urine. It's sterile. No one's getting me blood! House's nose starts bleeding. Why isn't anybody getting me blood?,"Well, I just like to look good OK, so"
House are you all right?,Why are you Even here?,Im sorry. You all right?
I'm always here.,No you're not.,I will be here.
"No you're not. There got to be a reason. There has to be. House closes his eyes, there's a quick shot of each of the ducklings, then Cuddy who smiles, then John who opens his eyes and starts laughing Manically.","So, where were we?","No, youre not!"
You have a nice night?,Yes I did thank you. I'm guessing better than our Patient. PRobably due to his BP and hematocrit plunging. Throws the remote to Foreman.,"High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most."
How'd you know? House walks out.,"The answer was staring right at us the whole time, as plain as the nose on our faces, or the nose on his face.","Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if Id need to knock every time I came over here."
"What's going on, what'd he say?",No hairs and cauterisation scars.,Whats he say?
Confused. Which means?,He had it cauterised.,What is the meaning of this?
How could you know that?,"Because it makes sense, undoubtedly done to stop the same Parkldhood nosebleeds that plagued his grandfather, undoubtedly because they were both born with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia.","So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch."
What's he saying?,I'm saying you got a genetic disease that is destroying your capillaries.,Bigger. So big you cant even see the top sometimes. Its hidden in clouds.
That no one in his family has Ever been diagnosed with before?,"Not surprising, since the most common initial symptoms, skin rashes and nosebleeds, are often written off as the result of minor trauma or dry weather.",When did we get a floor safe?
"Oh, looks like solving the case, solved your other pRoblem.","There is no medicine like happiness, except maybe laughter, or rubber tubes shoved up your urethra.","No, no, Im still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out."
You cathed yourself?,"It's actually not that bad after the first... I don't know, 9 or 10 inches. Cath reliEved the spasm. I'm as good as new.","No, it wasnt my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger."
"Of course, just a minor spasm in a muscle you've been using multiple times a day without any pRoblem for the past 45 years. Not a major side effect caused by the overuse of a particular narcotic painkiller.",Flushes. Yeah that was my thought too. Walks over to wash his hands.,Not if theyre doing it for a long time.
"Flushes with his elbow. So, no reason to think about cutting back on your use of that particular pill.",Thank god.,You just took it.
You really got the answer in your sleep?,"I got one in my sleep, the other one I got in the shower. Walks out.","Umhmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study."
"I got one in my sleep, the other one I got in the shower. Walks out.",I've been thinking about you. You lied.,"You tell me, you woke up in bed with one."
"I didn't lie, I simply chose not to share completely irrelevant facts.",Like the fact that you lied. No wonder I couldn't place his face. You were practically swallowing it on the dance floor.,"I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous."
I was not.,"Talk about the cool uncle, he donates the money while the nephew gets the write off. Of course by write off I mean he gets to put your ankles...",And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
Puts her hand on his chest to stop House talking. This is exactly why I didn't mention our one date over two years ago.,Because of my t-shirt?,"It was our first date, there was an awkward silence."
Drags House away from the nurses station. Because you are an obnoxious ass. Because you would've spent the whole time...,"That's very smart, because this way I spent my whole time completely focused on the Patient.",Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
How did you Even remember him? We were only at that party for like 10 minutes.,What is this some new health plan? You service the Dean of Medicine and you get free health care for a year? Cuddy smiles. Why are you smiling?,"Wow! I dont remember him. Honey, are you sure youre not talking about your imaginary boyfriend."
You remembered him because he made out with me.,"I'm good with faces. So this plan, is it open to anyone? Is there a co-pay?",How could you not remember that we slept together?
You're lousy with faces.,"Don't make this about me, this is your humiliation. So how much for private room coverage?",Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
Still smiling. Get over me. Starts to walk away.,Oh give me a break. You hired me...,Lets see that smile.
Because you're a good doctor who couldn't get himself hired at a blood bank so I got you cheap.,You gave me Everything I asked for because one night I gave you Everything you...,cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
"Stop staring at my ass when you think I'm not looking, showing up at restaurants where I happen to be on a date and fantasising about me in the shower. That ship sailed long ago House. Get over it. Walks away.",If you're still referring to you ass I think that super tanker sailed would be a more precise metaphor.,"Well, I dont think there is anything to do."
If you're still referring to you ass I think that super tanker sailed would be a more precise metaphor.,"Sorry, looking for an extra large trash can. Dumps the files and paper in the bin and walks out shutting the door behind him.","Okay, you just go on and make your little jokeyjokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea."
"S. S is speech. I'm slurring. I'm slurring? Huh. Oh! Tyson puts down guitar and turns back to Emma. Oh. F-A-S-T. T is time. Hurry, somebody, uh. Call 911. Tell them I'm having a stroke. She falls flat on her back and lays there. Everyone rushes around her.",Hi. I'm Dr. House. My boss says you're important. Slides door closed.,"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so were trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her."
Slides door closed. Oh.,Personally I don't get what's so hard about making Scarlett Johansson look pretty.,"You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand."
"It's so easy, you should consider a career change. PRobably make a lot more money. With her eyes closed, her right hand starts turning inward.",Dr. MackMan tell you the clot was clear?,I have to stop her.
MackMan tell you the clot was clear? Yes.,And he said you and the fetus are fine.,"They are clear, my Master."
And he said you and the fetus are fine. Yeah.,He didn't mention your pronator drift.,"So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?"
What's that mean?,It means MackMan is an idiot. He sighs and gestures to the side of the bed. May I?,"Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain."
Yeah. He moves her camera out of the way so he can sit on the bed.,So. You take thousands of photos of someone but only one has to look good. Kind of the opposite of my business. He is checking her eyes while they talk.,"Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night."
It's not about looking good. People are always hiding things. I just keep shooting until I can see what's really inside them. My eyes okay?,Eyes are gorgeous. Vessels don't look so hot. Micro-aneurysms predict further strokes.,"Oh, I cant because I keep them hidden."
This is going to happen again?,Unless I can figure out the underlying cause.,Its never gonna happen again right?
"Oh, my uh! baby's biological father is a neurologist. He once told me the FAST mnemonic could save my life one day so",Interesting pet name. Most people go with husband or pookie.,"Thats funny, because my father was not a very clever man."
He's gay. Just a sperm donor. So when you,You turned him for a night? Just straight for one date?,"Ridiculous, Angela. And like Im going to believe one of his spermed lovers."
Okay. He took a magazine and a cup into my bathroom.,A Man after my own heart.,"Okay, hes in the bathroom, lets go."
"He's caring. House enters, walks to picture and pulls it down.",Find anything else in the Patient's folder? Like a diagnosis?,So I closed the door but the image of his.
Urinalysis rEvealed excessive protein and red blood cells. Chem panel showed a creatinine lEvel over 2.5.,"So first she strokes, now her kidneys are shutting down. Why?",You went to seven proms?
BP is fine. No preeclampsia.,Any of you guys Ever been to the Galapagos?,Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
"Was our Patient there? Dengue fEver, avian pox. Even West Nile.",No. I'm looking for a vacation spot.,"Oh, I like their emergency room."
That mean we get vacation?,How would that differ from your current status?,Talk about vacation days!
You're going to do what? Relax?,Visiting family. My uncle's a giant turtle.,And youre going to stay calm?
"What if the kidney failure came first? Kidneys could have caused the stroke, not the other way around.",Kidneys don't often get stuck in the brain.,"Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?"
"I'm saying it threw a clot. Early symptoms of kidney failure are nausea, vomiting, swelling. She could have mistaken it for morning sickness.",Heart's way more likely to throw a clot than the kidney.,"Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but theyre to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra"
Echo's normal. The history indiCates no sign of cardiac pRoblems.,"No, but if one were to read the history closely, one would have noticed that she had six cases of strep.","Honey, listen, yknow what?"
In her throat. That's the one about 10 inches above the heart.,Let me rephrase. Six cases of untreated strep.,"Um, I dont know."
She was prescribed antibiotics.,No one takes them all. They stop when they start feeling better. All strep is untreated strep. What happens when strep goes untreated?,He gave me a pill for it.
It leads to rheumatic fEver.,"Which leads to, Cameron?",Youll die young.
Mitral valve stenosis.,Which is a thickening in the valve of the!kidney? No. The kidney doesn't have a mitral valve.,Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
We'll go look at the heart. The fellows start to leave. House calls after them.,"It'll be easy to find. It's the big, red pumping thing about ten inches below her throat.","Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest."
Start threading the catheter.,"I don't want a layover in Frankfurt, Taipei, Singapore or London, Ontario.",Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through
Can you tell Cuddy to stop interfering?,It's her job. What's new?,"Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please."
You're vacationing in Cambodia? You're going to unwind in the killing fields?,Nope. Gonna catch me a fish this big. He holds his arms very wide. Mekong giant catfish weighs over 600 pounds.,"Thats good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh."
Aren't those catfish critically endangered?,That's why it's my last chance to catch one.,"Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish."
There are only a few possibilities. Patient's pregnant. It could be preeclampsia. We eliminated it before because,Check for proteinuria and low platelets. What else?,Something called BraxtonHicks contractions.
"Hypoperfusion. The fetus is basically a parasite, stealing nutrients, minerals, blood.",Put her on telemetry.,The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.
"A cholesterol embolism is just as likely. Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down, clog up the small vessels in the kidneys.",Get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque.,I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
"That's it, has to be one of those five.",You know what would be Even better? If we could narrow it all the way down to one. They fellows leave in unison.,So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
Looking up from microscope and turning to the others. She's 0 for 5.,Either the differential was wrong or she's faking it.,"Ohh, shes looking down the hall."
We did the labs. No one else had access.,That's not quite true. He exits.,In the lab?
Through oxygen mask You put all your Patients through this Many tests or just the important ones?,Bending down and picking up a piece of clothing from the floor We wanted to explore all the possibilities.,Im still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Bending down and picking up a piece of clothing from the floor We wanted to explore all the possibilities. And?,We've eliminated all the possibilities.,You couldnt have taken off all your clothes in the mens room?
You're telling me I'm dying and you have no idea why?,Your body is functioning properly.,You appear to be dying.
So why are my kidneys failing?,The other body isn't. There's something wrong with the fetus. Emma looks at him and tightens her mouth.,No. No! Youre doing great! Dont you give up! Thats why we didnt tell you and were not gonna drag you down with us.
The other body isn't. There's something wrong with the fetus. Emma looks at him and tightens her mouth.,Welcome to the world of maternal mirror syndrome.,"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!"
Who are the Jews in this metaphor?,A few things can happen to a fetus in distress.,"I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage preadolescent Jews."
I've read the outcome of mirror syndrome is almost always unfavorable.,Unfavorable. Is that doctor speak for dead baby? You think she'll be less upset if you phrase it nicely?,"Why? When I look in the mirror, I dont like the face that looks back."
"We can tell her the truth that she'll be fine as soon as we diagnose a person who weighs about one pound. Can't touch it, can't ask where it hurts, can't see it.",If only there existed giant maParknes that could look through huMan skin. Mirror syndrome has a limited number of known causes.,"Oh, no, no, no, itsits not the lecture ah, I mind, umm."
"Tacharrythmia, fetal anemia, placental chorioangioma","All of which are fixable. Which would be un-unfavorable, right?",What did the doctor say?
"Could also be trisomy 13, Epstein's anomaly, an aneurysm of Galen's vein",And Dr.,"He has a birthmark, your grace."
It was in the range but blurry. The fetus was moving all over the place.,So we need another scan.,"My God, the babys kicking."
"Yeah. We'll just ask the fetus to lie very, very still.",No need. I'm going to paralyze it.,Of course we can.
You want to paralyze Emma Sloan's baby?,Let me guess. Cameron.,I cant believe youd want us to raise Emma.
Cameron and Chase both had their concerns.,"No, Cameron had concerns. Chase just agreed with her because he didn't want to lose his all-access pass to her love rug.","Michael, uh... we shouldnt be talking about this until all the decisions have been made."
They're sleeping together?,If by sleeping together you mean having sex in the janitor's closet.,I heard they made out and had sex.
If by sleeping together you mean having sex in the janitor's closet. Here?,"No, the janitor's closet at the local high school. Pumps his fist Go, Tigercats. Do you have one of those camera-phones? Because I have a MySpace account.","Oh uh no we dont live together um we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms."
I will deal with them after I deal with you.,"Oh, come on. Let's gossip some more. I'm sure she's into bondage. Cuddy grabs his arm and turns him to look at her.","All right, uh, weve got a little bit of a problem here."
Paralyzing a one-pound baby risks damaging,Not paralyzing the thing risks not getting a clean MRI of its heart. Which we need to save its life which we need to do to save Emma's life.,"So, I was reading how its a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class."
You're gonna need to get her consent.,That shouldn't be too hard. Sign here or you and your baby both die.,Cant happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
I'm going with you.,"Oh, good.",Id go with that.
You said sedation was risky. This sounds insane.,The injection goes into the umbilical cord.,"Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you cant put a price on safety."
The baby won't feel a thing.,Fetus! I'm lowering expectations. It works here and on dates. The benefits outweigh the risks and the paralytic will wear off in an hour. Okay?,Relax. Youre only at nine centimeters. And the babys at zero station.
"It must be easier to hear that you might die than your baby might die. But if there's anyone I would trust to save my baby, it would be Dr. House. Emma snorts again.",whispers Fetus. Hold this.,Oh no no no.
Chase isn't the one who's gonna get hurt here.,There's only room for one. Though I could scooch over.,"Okay, look, hes not gonna hurt them, right?"
My social life is my social life.,Couldn't agree more. What goes on in the privacy of a janitor's closet is nobody's business except,"For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life."
She told me to end it. Is that what you want?,I was actually hoping she'd fire one of you.,Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?
What are you doing?,Trying to avoid altitude sickness. Couldn't score a direct flight to Cambodia so I decided to scale Argentina's infamous Mount Aconcagua,"Ha. Well, thats what I am, queen of the nerds."
"Perfect, except for the fact that you can't walk.",There's a tribe of Macovi Indians who actually carry the elders up,"Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and youre there."
There's a tribe of Macovi Indians who actually carry the elders up You're insane.,I'm an insane genius.,Will you shut up?
What are you doing?,"Well, you're trying to be me so I thought I'd try to be you.",Because not everybody knows about the party.
You don't have the cleavage for it.,But I have a much tighter ass.,Its just so frustrating!
They aren't back yet.,They're gonna to be inconclusive.,Theyll be back soon.
You think my diagnosis is wrong?,"Fetus doesn't pee, amniotic fluid should be low. Mom's lEvel is fine.",Is this what I think it is?
Doesn't mean I'm wrong. Could just mean we caught the obstruction early.,"Either way, your test will be inconclusive.",See thats where I think that youre wrong.
"Fine, then I'll do another tap.",Just as useless.,Fine. Hey. Tap away.
Thank you. I'll run two more taps.,Since when does the Dean of Medicine run bladder taps?,"Alright, great. Thanks a lot. Im going to tap class."
She's an important Patient.,Because she takes pictures?,People think youre pulling the kings strings.
Pushing the file at him It's your file.,I don't want it.,I dont want to look at your file!
Then why did you just say all that stuff?,To humiliate you.,Then why didnt you say that?
You're taking the case back.,I don't want it. Your diagnosis is right. I wanna go on vacation.,"And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car."
Emma's jaundiced. Her liver's shutting down.,big sigh Figures. Just booked my trip to Johnston Straight.,"Oh my god, wheres Emma?"
I thought you were climbing Mount whatEver. In Argentina.,Apparently I'd have to live with the Macovi Indians for twenty years before they'd consider me an elder.,"Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking"
"Increased AST, ALT and her bilirubin's off the charts.",Even fetuses lie.,And more hands.
We won't be able to get a good look until they dEvelop. It'll be weeks,She's not going to last weeks.,They wont be ready for weeks.
What do you want to do?,Maternal Mirror Syndrome has one surefire cure. Deliver the fetus.,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
It's not viable at twenty-one weeks. You'll kill the baby.,Fetus.,"Hey, as long as the babys healthy."
Do seMantics make you feel better? Pretend it's not a person?,Can it play catch?,"Come on, you do it to feel superior."
Can it play catch? Can it eat? Can it take pretty pictures? Who wants to tell her? All three refuse to meet his eyes. He pushes off his desktop and grabs his coat.,The swollen bladder was not the only pRoblem. We can't leave it inside you. We have to terminate.,"I mean, its a cat, yknow, its a cat."
"Well, can't you deliver him? Put him on a respiratory maParkne until you figure out what's wrong.",We can. And it won't matter. The fetus is still at least two weeks away from being viable.,Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I dont know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
"Oh, well. I'll suffer through this for at least two more weeks, then.",You're on dialysis for your kidneys. Your kidneys can wait. They don't make dialysis for your liver. You're not going to make it two more days.,"Okay, so I guess thats about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in."
thinks about this then shakes her head slightly I'm not gonna let you kill my baby.,It's killing you.,"Okay, um... I dont want her watching our baby."
I'm not having an abortion.,It's not a baby.,Do you want to know why you dont want me to have the baby?
Or you fix him and we both live.,I can't fix it. I'm scheduling a D and C. He gets up to leave.,"Or ya know, hes rubber and youre glue."
I won't consent. He stops and looks at her. So I guess you have two days to figure it out. He leaves.,Her kidneys are almost irreparable. She's dEveloped sEvere DIC. You have to force her to terminate.,"Thats crazy! You cant do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, havent you?"
Did you give corticosteroids to speed the baby's lung dEvelopment?,No! I dropped an anvil on its chest to prEvent lung dEvelopment. I'm trying to extinguish the huMan race one fetus at a time.,You think your doctors going to give you a Csection at six months?
"Give the lungs more time to expand so you can see inside them, see if they're the pRoblem.",My real Patient is dying.,Its called Lamaze breathing.
"You're not going to get Emma to see it that way. She's pRobably already named the baby. Read him books, had conversations with him.","See, you get it. She'll listen to you.",Are you two talking about the same baby?
She'll listen to you. No.,"You let this Woman refuse to terminate, you're helping her commit suicide. As her doctor, my recommendation is against suicide.","Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?"
"If the baby had a doctor, I think she would recommend exhausting all possibilities before taking its life.",Then she'd be an idiot.,"Well, its not your fault."
What if our original assumption is wrong.,It isn't.,What if shes correct?
The fetus is hydropic and in distress. Emma's kidneys and liver are failing. The diagnosis is solid.,"Wow. If the ass kisser won't agree with you, you must be Even wronger than I thought.",Good thing were friends or wed be fucking you in the ass right now.
"Fine. Let's assume she had mirror syndrome but we fixed it when we fixed the baby's bladder. That means that her failing liver would be completely unrelated. If it is, we can fix it. And we don't have to terminate.",So her theory is that our Patient's liver pRoblems were just a giant coincidence.,"If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed."
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy would have the same symptoms. Thank you.,Brown-noser.,Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Viral hepatitis. HELLP syndrome.,Oh look. Sticking up for your girlfriend. Who says Parkvalry's dead?,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you.
He's not joking? Cameron gives him an exasperated sigh.,Be Patient. She's going through all of us. She'll get that jungle fEver Eventually. Cameron glares at House.,"Well, come on, Steve lets not rule out nervous laughter."
I'm not going through anyone.,You love him? Chase and Cameron each give him a look.,"Just so you know, Im not seeing anyone else."
Wilson sighs. It worked.,What worked?,"Uhhuh, I can already feel it working."
I got the baby's lungs to expand. We should be able to figure out,Cab's on its way. I have to finish packing. He starts to close the door. She pushes it open.,"Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep."
I have a whole new appreciation for what you do. How hard it is to beliEve when Everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong.,Helps to know they're idiots.,"Well, Im glad you have a new appreciation for your job."
Do you think I'm an idiot? She pulls out an x-ray.,You're not objective. But you're not an idiot. He takes the film and holds it to the light. His lungs are still two weeks away from being viable.,"No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils."
But big enough for a diagnosis.,These tissue buds are new. Could indiCate bronchopulmonary sequestration or diaphragmatic Eventration.,"Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed."
I was thinking bronchogenetic cysts or bronParkal atresia.,Could be lung lesions. CCAM.,Im trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
"What about House has slammed the door in her face. She stands there for a few seconds, apparently in shock when the door reopens. House has put his jacket on.",Move. He motions for Cuddy to back up so he can lock the door.,"Carol and Susans apartment, Susan is there."
I thought you started your vacation.,Somebody had to save our boss' rotundous ass. Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.,Would you like to have a vacation this year?
Small buds in the lungs could indiCate,"Thanks. Got that multiple choice all worked out. The question is, how do we pick between A, B, C, D and none of the above.","So, did you shave your legs?"
Fetal lungs are so tiny an MRI won't give us the details we need.,What would we do if this Patient were not just a tadpole. Say it was an actual person.,"You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar."
He! is a person.,"Thanks for playing along. Pretend that it's a one-pound adult. Forget the mom, forget the womb, the placenta. How would we get a better look at what's in the lungs?","We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach."
Too much radiation for a one-pound person.,"Makes whining eheheheh sound. You can't just shoot Everything down, Chase. You're not me. Collaborate.",Im uh in a Im in a radiation suit.

Why? Because we stayed up all night doing exactly what you told us to do?,No. Because you stayed up all night doing exactly what I told you to do and have nothing to show for it.,You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight?
We eliminated dozens of wrong answers.,I asked you what 2 2 equals and a day later you tell me not 25.,I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem.
The pathology report just got filed. Found granulomas in Lucy's pericardium. Hands House the report. Could be a case of fungal infection.,Nice work.,My name is Rick Sanchez.
He went home!,"Work smart, not hard. Chase smiles at Cameron. Find out which fungus, biopsy a lymph node. Take employee of the month with you.",I cant let you starve.
I would rather Foreman...,I know. Walks into his office.,"I like that, so manager and comanager."
Looking worried. What do you mean? To Cameron and Chase. What's happening?,"So, what does the double vision tell us?","OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?"
"It's not fungal either, lymph node biopsy was clean.",So we're back to square one.,"Yeah, I do."
One and a half. We've eliminated two more conditions.,"Yes, 22 doesn't equal 12 or 16 either.",Four and a half.
"Scoffs Yeah, tough to find a 6 year old who doesn't have Lupus or Kawasakis.",Did you look at her knees?,Were not afraid of physical activity.
Did you look at her knees?,"Those knobby things in the middle of her legs, any scars or scabs?","Probably the only time Ill ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?"
What does that have to do with...,"Well most 6 year olds hurt themselves, a lot. Crash their bikes, climb trees, bungee jump.",Im sure that has that has nothing to do with this.
Dad said she doesn't like to run around outside.,Because running around outside hurts.,Shes a stubborn little beast.
She didn't mention anything about...,"Most 6 year olds are not familiar with the phrase 'my joints feel inflamed'. So, 22 equals?","There, theres chapters about potty training, and bedwetting and masturbation."
"Most 6 year olds are not familiar with the phrase 'my joints feel inflamed'. So, 22 equals?",Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"and 12, 22, 18, four."
Oh I didn't know you were seeing a Patient.,It's an exam room. What did you think I was doing?,"I just meant that youre not married and your boyfriends kind of, Sheldon."
What you usually do - hiding from Cuddy.,"Well it'd be stupid to do it in here. There's a Patient in here. Wilson rolls his eyes. To Eddie, the Patient. You been drinking more?",Back away. Keep backing away till youre outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
"Ah no, I, I....",To Wilson who is still standing in the doorway Guy's peeing all the time. Play. Interested?,When was the last time you saw her wear it?
"Sure, want me to pick you up?",I'm not going.,Okay. So Ill come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
You said two tickets.,You thought this was a date? Turns back to the Patient. Any other symptoms?,"Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets."
I really shouldn't...,Shows Wilson the tickets. You want the tickets or not?,"Hey, you dont have to."
Hesitating. Why don't you want to go with me?,It's a play. Dudes only go to plays if they're dragged by women they're hoping to see naked.,"Okay. Oh wait, waitwait, youre not gonna come with me?"
So why are you giving them to me?,Maybe there's someone you want to see naked.,Give them to me.
Looks at what the play is. All right. Takes the tickets and leaves.,Turns back to the Patient. Any fEver?,"Oh, for Gods sake, just come to the play."
Any fEver? No.,Anything in your pee other than pee?,"Not now, Temp."
Anything in your pee other than pee? No.,I'm going to need a urine sample.,"Oh, some, thats fine."
I'm going to need a urine sample. No!,Yeah that last one wasn't a question. You might have diabetes...,"We just need urine, sir."
I can't pee in public.,We have bathrooms.,Thank you so much for letting me do this.
I can't pee in public bathrooms.,Where can you pee?,I do not have to urinate.
"The stroke was caused by a clot in her middle cerebral artery. Started her on TPA. It should dissolve the clot and hopefully prEvent brain damage, but we wont know for sure until she regains consciousness.","Or she has another stroke. Arthritis, heart disease, why can't this kid act her age?",Phyllis says the same twelve clichs every time it rains.
"It's a symptom of polycythemia, she's fully hydrated and her blood's still thicker than pancake batter.","Well thick blood explains the stroke, could also have caused an autoimmune response, which would explain the JRA kicking into gear. But what explains the thick blood?","Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?"
"Lack of oxygen, forces the body to over produce red cells.",What explains the lack of oxygen?,What does Level Red mean?
Scoffs. He says he's not.,"Hey! Don't make me turn the hose on you two. Chase is right. You two go check the House, see if Dad's a closet Marlboro Man.","Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. Id smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things."
You're intentionally punishing us.,By making you do your job?,Im punishing them.
Turns to House. What if it's sexual? We should call social services.,Well this sucks.,I call their apartment!
We can't do a vaginal exam on a 6 year old without the Dad's consent and if he's abusing her he'll nEver say yes.,NEver is just rEven spelt backwards. Hands the t-shirt to Foreman and leaves.,"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?"
Are those the urine test results?,Yes.,"Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriffs deputy."
Yes. And!,I'm going to ask you for some blood.,"No, no and no."
I'm going to ask you for some blood. Why?,To see if your answer will be 'I can't bleed in public'. This wasn't your urine was it?,"The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
Why would I give you someone else's urine?,Usual reason is because you're on steroids.,Do you want to give Michael your urine?
I'm not an athlete.,Duh. The second favourite reason is because you're on drugs.,"Oh, you want to bet?"
The second favourite reason is because you're on drugs. I'm not.,I am.,I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order.
"Need you, now. Leaves.",My work here is done. Starts to leave.,"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but its getting real late now"
Am! I! ok? Is it diabetes?,"No, you're pregnant.","No, no, no, youre doing fine, really."
6-year-old abuse victim and you haven't called social services?,She might have been abused. That's horrifying. Why are you wearing extra concealer under your eyes?,"You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?"
"The law's clear, you suspect abuse you call the authorities. You don't proceed as usual while the possible abuser sits by her bedside.","Dad consented to the exam, which means it's not the Dad. How late were you out last night?","No, no, no, no, no, we dont need to call the police."
It's always the Dad and I don't have a curfew.,Loudly. Panty hamster get a spin on its wheel?,"Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around."
"I went to a play, House is shocked. House you are going back to your office, you are picking up your phone, calling social services and you are reporting suspected abuse. Do you understand?",What play?,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying Go to your room!"
Do you understand? What play?,You're trying to have sex with Cuddy.,"Oh, is the play over?"
Looks at House. Fries?,You took her to a play. You only take women to plays because...,"How about those fries though, huh?"
"No, YOU only take women to plays for that reason. That's your theory.","Ok, then why did you take her to a play?","No, women are welcome to play."
She's a friend.,A friend with a squish mitten.,Whyd you say shes your friend?
It is possible to have a friend of the opposite sex without...,"Blasphemer! She's not a friend of the opposite sex, she's a different species. Takes a fry. She's an administrator. She's going to eat your head after she's done.","No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted."
"Yes, I slept with her.",Shocked. Seriously?,You banged her?
Seriously? No.,Not convinced. Yes you did.,Are you kidding?
Quietly. Yes I did.,Shocked. Seriously?,I did... often and loudly.
We just tested the blood on Lucy's t-shirt. It's full of endometrial cells.,It's not her blood.,"Okay. Hey Meredith, wheres your uterus?"
"She got her period and didn't know what it was. She was scared and confused. A friend told her to put a t-shirt in her underwear. When she started growing pubic hair, she snuck Daddy's razor and tried to shave it off.",Apparently forgot to sneak the shaving cream.,"Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story."
She's 6. She's tiny. She lives on Parkcken fingers and milk. Dad doesn't look like the type to read labels. He's pRobably buying stuff packed full of hormones.,Excellent argument. To Foreman It's a tumour.,"Look, I need this."
"There's all sorts of environmental sources. Pesticides, soy products! Some shampoos are basically a placenta in a bottle.",If the tumour's not in her brain it's in her reproductive tract. Get an MRI. Gets up.,I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?
Can I at least...,Waste your time? Wouldn't recognise you if you didn't.,Can you at least
You have to choose one. There's a bright spot on her left ovary. Looks like a solid tumour.,They printed my letter. Pays for the magazine and starts to walk off. Wilson runs up behind him.,No. Dont do that. Youre not. Youre not stupid.
You were right.,Of course I was. What are we talking about? Holds up the magazine. They printed my letter.,"Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell."
They printed my letter. Great. Cuddy.,You want to see her naked. They walk over to the doors to the Clinic.,"Boy, Im really curious what was in that letter."
"No, no, no. She wants to see ME naked. She sent me flowers.",Just thanking you for the play. You see some people fell an emotion called gratitude.,"See, shes trying to get you back."
There's a card.,I suspected. Explains how you knew who they were from.,Give me the punch card.
Pulls out the card and shows House. Lets do it again. Soon. X X. Lisa. Xs are the kisses right?,No! I think they're the hugs. I think Os are the kisses.,You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
"No, no, Xs are definitely the kisses. Soon is its own sentence. Sees Cuddy in the clinic. I got to go. Walks off quickly.",I'll miss you. You were a good friend. House walks into the clinic towards Cuddy. Holds up the magazine. They printed my letter. How was the play Mrs. Lincoln?,"Soon. See, I couldve said in the near future, but I didnt say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already."
What's up with Wilson?,He's just a little freaked.,Why is Packer back?
He's just a little freaked. Why?,I sent him flowers. Smiles. Cuddy looks confused.,Hes uncomfortable because youre acting weird.
"Get him off! Cameron starts trying to pull Jasper off, Jasper bites Chase's arm and growls. AHH! He's biting me! Get him off! AHH! Cameron pulls him away, Chase looks at the big bite mark on his arm that is bleeding.",Answers. Somebody better be dying.,She untied his Gstring with her teeth.
Lucy's big brother's got a crush on me so he bit the crap out of Chase.,And I care because?,You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.
Just thought you might want to know when one of your employees gets attacked by a sociopath.,"Bees or monkeys yes, sociopaths no.","Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!"
"Bees or monkeys yes, sociopaths no. Hello?",He's not a sociopath.,"No, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around."
How do you know?,He's acting logically. He's got a crush on you. He's being aggressive about it. Not just regular aggressive. He's out of his mind on hormones aggressive.,"So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar."
You think he's...,Better figure out what's killing the girl cause her brother's got it too.,Basically we just feel that hes.
Yes you would think that if for some reason you were completely unaware of the fact that we spent the entire night testing Everything from that home. It was all negative.,To Foreman You went home? Foreman nods. House is pleased. Good for you. Delegate.,"Not yet. How will I learn if Im comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because Im in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment."
We're not his subordinates.,Making it all the more impressive.,Hes not your servant.
Turns to House. That's ridiculous. If menstruation is a symptom of brain cancer then I should be on chemo right now.,That's ridiculous. You're way too skinny to be menstruating.,"Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb."
What if the mum had other pRoblems? Symptoms her doctors ignored on account of the fact she was already dying.,"Pull all of her medical records, find any similarities to our Patients, and punch the little brat on the nose so he doesn't have a stroke like his sister.",All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now.
Stomach pain is from a cyst in her pancreas. Found two more in her kidneys and one in her lung. They weren't there 48 hours ago. The hormones are making her body go haywire.,"If she gets one in her brain or heart, she's dead. Turns to Cameron and Chase. No pressure though.",Im here to take you to Kings Landing and bring back Lady Starks daughters in exchange.
It's not genetic. It's not environmental. It's got to be a pituitary adenoma.,"Yes, that would make complete sense if they had one.","Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around cause theres a worm inside."
Just because we haven't found anything on the scan doesn't mean it's not there. We should remove her pituitary gland.,"Two siblings, same condition. Its got to be genetic or environmental. If you add in 'same time' and we're back to just environmental.","Look, if shes talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too."
Yes and that would make complete sense if there was anything in her environment.,Mimicking Cameron. Just because we haven't found anything yet.,"Yeah. Ok, you dont have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason shed be hanging around?"
I'm getting the father's consent. Starts to leave.,No! Cameron stops. We have no evidence.,"I, uh... I am going to be a father."
The ovaries produce sex hormones in response to a signal from the pituitary gland. Since we know the ovaries are fine the most likely cause...,"Interrupting. Most likely means she wants to root around inside your little girl's brain without any guarantee that it will work, that's why she's holding off on doing your son.","Because, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married."
Dr. House knows that unfortunately we've ruled out Every other option. We need to resect Lucy's pituitary before...,Who else visits these kids?,"Hey, come on, guys, focus."
They don't have any family in town.,You got a girlfriend?,Theres nothing to do in this town.
No one visits.,School?,There was no other guest the entire time I was here.
"They don't go to the same school, House I...",Nanny?,Wait! But Ross if they dont get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
They go to an after school day care but none of the other kids are sick.,"Yet. It took your son twice as long to dEvelop symptoms as your daughter, maybe the other kids are just slow.",Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
We wait and your daughter may die.,She does this and your daughter will need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of her life.,"Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughters life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
The treatments are extremely effective. She should lead a relatively normal life.,"And isn't that Every parents dream, to have a kid grow up to be relatively normal.",No? But were friends!
My husband died of thyroid cancer that metastasised to his brain. I've been there. I know how terrifying this can be. I am telling you this is your best chance to save your daughter's life.,Whispers in Cameron's ear.,Of course Im afraid for her!
Thank you. Leaves.,How did you know?,"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave."
Stops and turns around. Know what?,That the other kids weren't sick. You've been here for 4 days.,Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!
I just... I would've heard. Leaves.,Right...,I thought you had already.
Leaves. Right...,Smiles. Do you have hair on your special place?,"Do you mean, leaves as in dies?"
Can I help you?,I'm a doctor. Two of your kids are sick and I need to know why.,"Okay, go home, crazy man."
You think they got sick here?,I think you're dating their Dad.,Yeah sorry everyone else didnt come.
He told you?,"No, but I don't really care why he didn't. I just need to know how often you go to their House and what you bring.","Yello. No, Rachels not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, byebye. Hey, whos this uh, this Casey?"
I just need to know how often you go to their House and what you bring. I don't.,"Shampoos, fancy soaps, kids get in your bag?",You are their guest.
"I've nEver been to their House. They just lost their mom, and we thought it was too soon. House stares at her rash just above her lip. Why are you staring at me?",Lip wax?,"Why would you need to say hi to them, youve been feeding them for four days?"
I just had it done over lunch.,Grabs her hand. Mani-pedi?,"No, had it done to me though."
"Pulls her hand back. No, just the wax.","Women get a wax as part of a whole self-indulgent beauty ritual pedicure, steam, cucumber masks.",Well get to the wax in a minute.
You're an ass. Cameron.,It's always the Dad.,Thats why youre not in charge Meredith.
It's always the Dad.,"Excess facial hair in women, it's a clear sign of hormonal imbalance, exactly what the little kiddies have.","No no, seriously, Joeys my dad, Monicas my dad."
Is there something wrong at the Day Care Centre?,There's something wrong in your pants.,We signed Cici up for this daycare.
"Oh... She's a lot younger than I am, I... use a male enhancement cream to keep up with her. What does this have to do with...",NEver occurred to you to get a prescription instead of some penis pumper loaded with testosterone?,"Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like Im a piece of meat?"
I keep it at the gym. I apply it daily in the shower just like it says on the bottle. It's nEver been in my home. It's obviously nEver been near the kids.,But you have.,Why dont you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
We've been through that I'm not a pervert or a paedophile.,30% of our waste is excreted through our skin.,No! I am not a pervert! Okay? Its just I just Kinda
So... I did this to them? House nods. Just holding their hands?,Uh-huh.,"Okay, you know what?"
If I stop using it?,"You'll be floppy, they'll be fine. Looks at Jasper teasing Lucy by not letting her get her bunny. He'll still be eight. Pops a pill.","Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?"
"You'll be floppy, they'll be fine. Looks at Jasper teasing Lucy by not letting her get her bunny. He'll still be eight. Pops a pill.",Takes off his glasses. You ok?,"Yes, youll be all grown up by then."
"Yeah, I think so.",Puts the magazine down. Talk to Cuddy?,"I think maybe, yeah."
"No, not yet! Takes his hands off his face. I don't know what to say.",Just... be straight with her.,"So, have you figured out what youre going to say to him?"
I'm not sure what that is. I... I can't stop thinking about her.,Trying not to smile. In what way?,"Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!"
"Maybe she's right, maybe... maybe this is worth exploring?",Still trying fairly successfully to keep a straight face. You sure she feels...,Is she suggesting what I think shes suggesting?
She sent me flowers! How do I do this? What do I say?,"Cameron would tell you to say how you feel. Me, I'd get her drunk.","Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?"
"Thinks. I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to walk into her office, and I'm going to kiss her. Slaps his hand as if to say 'and that's that.'",Struggling to keep a straight face he has to cover his mouth with his hand.,"Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting?"
"Yeah. I mean I'll either get a girlfriend or get fired. Looks at House, he doesn't say anything. Ok... yea... ok... Gets up and leaves, House almost bursts out laughing while Wilson is on his way out. Once Wilson is gone he goes to take a sip of his coffee. Suddenly Wilson bursts back in, pointing at him You, you, you! You were going to let me do that?!",Laughs. Well you made a compelling argument.,You bet your ass Im gonna fire you!
YOU sent those flowers to me!,"Yes, because, you took her to a play Wilson throws his arms up in the air. because actually you do want to march down there and kiss her.","Aww. Well, ok, well thats very nice. And you wrote a card . From Gavin"
No! I don't!,Yes you do.,"Hold on, who decides whos worthy?"
Sighs. You're right.,Shocked. Seriously?,"Hey, youre right."
No. House smiles. You're a jerk. Wilson leaves.,Night Wilson.,"No, you guys, you really dont have to go, were done talking."
I don't get the whole May - December thing.,"Give him a break, it's May - October at worst.","I dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like Christmas to me."
Well why can't it be October - October?,May is when things start to get hot.,Cant we just postpone it till the spring?
Laughs. If that guy wasn't trying so hard to keep up with a women half his age he wouldn't have almost killed both his kids.,"Guy gets a little something-something, couple of kids have to die, circle of life.","He said...he said, he said that theyre having a great time. Im sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever."
"So Many people, so much energy and drama just trying to find someone who's almost nEver the right person anyway. It just... shouldn't be so hard.",Long pause. I got tickets to a play...,Why is it so hard to meet people?
"Unemployment. And before that I sold subscriptions on the phone. And before that, unemployment. Before that I worked in Jeans Gone Wild. Before that, unemployment. Before that I walked dogs. Before that!",Loss of free will. I like it. Maybe we can get Thomas Aquinas in for a consult. What caused the T.I.A.?,And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.

"I am no longer paying alimony she wanted her independence, so she got her realtor's license.","Market's doing badly, she wants money.","What can I do, she doesnt listen to me about renters insurance either."
"Market's doing badly, she's moving into a condo.",She wants,Is she moving out?
She wants me to take Hector.,Pool boy?,Yknow I think you can take her.
Pool boy? Dog.,No longer interested.,"Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?"
"We got him on our Honeymoon, so I'm like! other parent. But I can't take him! My hotel doesn't allow dogs, besides! I'm always here.",I asked Cuddy to a play Thursday. Wilson laughs.,Have you thought about putting him in a crate while youre out of the apartment?
"Oh, you! okay.",She said she was busy.,"All right, you!"
"And you didn't beliEve her, so you bribed a janitor, broke into her computer, checked her appointments",I asked her as a test.,...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork
What would you have learned if she'd said yes?,"A lot about bondage. She's busy for me, but not for you. She's not interested in the play qua play, she's interested in you.",One of which wouldve ended in sex had she not said no.
"No. I'm not getting sucked into the vortex of your insanity again. Don't pass me notes in class, don't tell me to ask her to the prom",You cannot see her socially. You're leading her on!,"Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her."
"I'll consider that after I take her to the Hockney exhibit. On Thursday. See, she is busy. It's not a date. House stares at him. She enjoyed the play. I enjoyed her enjoying the play. The Woman works hard, it's nice to see her relax.",So all this enjoying is an act of charity?,"Ok. Lets see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!"
I'm keeping the receipts for tax purposes.,What's life without the ability to make stupid choices?,And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
"You'd like that, wouldn't you, when your dad asked you out for dinner. I'll do the tests, you're stuck with the family.",You like Hockney?,"Ok, Ill tell you what."
You heard about that?,"Hot stuff, were the Venezuelan pictures.",Youyou know about that?
That's a trick question.,"Yes, but you have no idea how it's a trick.","Thats a trick question, right?"
I like art. I'm open to new things. What's the pRoblem?,"You're going to a gallery to see Venezuelan pictures that don't exist, but you won't go to a play with me. Why?","If youre an artist, you have to be okay with the idea that you cant please everybody all the time."
"House, why is my social life suddenly red-hot? One minute I'm mushing along with the huskies as usual, and all of a sudden it's global warming. You think you saw someone pick up a toy from the sandbox and suddenly you want it.",Is that why you said no?,Yknow what? It seems like all of the sudden so much has happened.
Maybe I just want a friend and Wilson is a safe choice.,I'm not safe? Cool. Wilson is nEver a safe choice.,"Even so, I think Im gonna pick Ross."
"Going to a gallery, we're not getting married.","Sure, you say that now. He always marries them in the end!","Oh, figuring out our wedding plans."

"It's got to be autoimmune, something lymposidic. White blood cells are attacking her own body.",The only question is what kind of autoimmune.,"You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car."
Doesn't matter what kind.,It always matters what kind.,What kind do you like?
Treatment is always steroids.,Treatment is always boring! Diagnosis is,What are you talking about?
"Okay. It's affecting the larger blood vessels, so it's gotta be giant cell arteritis. I'll start her on steroids. It's affecting her smaller blood vessels, it's gotta be lupus vasculitis. I'll start her on steroids. It's affecting","Yeah, got it. Start her on steroids.","Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things."
Good idea. He leaves.,Told you. That was boring. I gotta go out.,Whats the protocol for leaving?
I gotta go out. Why?,Wilson's got a date.,Why dont I take you out?
"It's got 15 foot ceilings, an open floor plan!. You know, I can't beliEve you called me.","Hey, I need a condo. Didn't you and Wilson have your first date around here?","Really?! Well, its just like everyone elses apartment. Its got rooms, walls, and ceilings."
"Wow, you remember where our first date was? I didn't think you were paying attention.",Really? He's my best friend.,"Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didnt realise that had become anything, yet."
Our first date was in Boston.,Oh. Not quite as close to here as I remembered.,Ourour first date was at a coffee shop.
But we're not here to talk about him.,Absolutely not.,"Alright, thats enough, cause I can say some things about him too."
Wait 'till you see the kitchen. All granite countertops!,"Since I wasn't paying attention back then, what was it like dating him?","Oh thats all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning on TV."
"Oh, it was nEver a date. I was coming off a bad relationship and he said we could go out as friends, you know, go see plays, go to a museum. I didn't think you liked Trenton.","Love it. So he'd say it's not a date, but then he'd jump you.",Was this supposed to be a date?
"Oh no, he meant it. Wilson, carefully calibrating his lEvel of protectiveness for your individual needs.",Did you just compare Wilson to a tampon?,"Oh Daddy, no he didnt mean anything by that, he really didnt."
"It's like walking into a sticky trap. Once you're the focus of all that attention, it's addictive. This unit's kitchen's got a chef's oven.",I cook a lot. Go on.,Its not so bad once you get used to it.
"It's the emotional stuff that really sucks you in. He's just so knight-in-shining armor, you know? Always there to support you, until he's not, but by then you're hooked. Hey, do you think you could talk to him about taking the dog? He's the only one that Hector really gets along with.","Hey hey, we're here to talk real estate, not Wilson. So you're saying if you actually had sex before you connected emotionally, you'd have gotten over it.","I know, I know, but uh just, Im telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where itit just feels like you wanna die, heshes really a good person."
"Oh yeah, it seems weird, doesn't it? Because sex with James is fantastic. Nobody works harder to give a Woman what she wants. It's got six burners. The chef's oven.",Right.,"Ok. Ok. Hey.

"Okay. Suppose Chase and Cameron are right. Suppose it's an autoimmune disease. What's the biggest danger of total body radiation? It suppresses the immune system, which is what we're trying to do with the steroids anyway!","I don't usually put out on the first date, but I gotta say, that is a rad move. Get her consent. Start the radiation.","Well, I dont know about the rest of you but Im just gonna say it."
The Patient is not too thrilled with me.,I'll get her consent.,No thank you.
"Foreman's got a personality issue, so you're going to step in?",Patient doesn't like Foreman. I'm interested.,Will you be the new manager?
Patient doesn't like Foreman. I'm interested.,"Fatigue, hair loss, possibility of damage to the lungs, infertility. All possible side effects of radiation. Why don't you like Dr. Foreman?","No! Nono! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, Haha! Gotcha!"
He thinks he's better than he is.,How good is he?,"Well, hes better than me and a lot better than you."
I don't know. Can we get back to what's wrong with me?,There's a small possibility of leukemia some time in the future. Hardly worth mentioning. You can't say he's better than he is if you don't know how good he is.,"Wait, does he eat chalk?"
No one's as good as he thinks he is.,I am. You might also get cataracts. Sign here.,Not as good as you.
I don't know. You're telling me how dangerous this is.,We're saving your life. We're that good. Sign there.,Then lets just not do this.
I can't decide.,"Would you rather a pencil or a pen? Who's the better James Bond, Sean Connery or Daniel Craig? Now, you see, that's not Even a decision.","Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, yknow what? I uh, I cant decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second."
Bonnie called last night to talk about the dog. Your name came up.,"Good lord, how do you still have teeth?","Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?"
"She's the worst realtor in New Jersey. What is this, escalation? I go out with Cuddy, you hook up with my ex? I don't Even know what that's designed to do.",You're an addict. I'm saving you from yourself.,Look. Shes a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. Shes a bumpkin. Pass.
"By condo shopping, thank you.","If I can figure out where you keep going wrong, then I can nip this Cuddy thing in the bud before she becomes the fourth ex-Mrs. Wilson.","Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first."
"Yes, I was worried there was no way to stop that train.",You have to have sex with Cuddy.,Thats what my train used to do.
Wait! to stop the train? House nods. Bonnie said quietly I'm bad in bed?,loudly Huh?!,"Well, II gotta go break up with Bonnie."
"I told her you were wasting her time, by the way.",You think that's going to stop her? The Woman's the worst realtor in New Jersey.,Im sorry to have wasted your time.
That's not cancer. It sounds like!,It sounds like she's septic.,"Oh, no, it does."
A lot of things can cause pain.,How much?,Tell me where it hurts.
But she had no fEver. Her LP was clear.,"Do an echo to confirm it's in her heart, and then I'll tell our Patient that we just killed her.","So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"
"Oh, great. You haven't been returning my phone calls.",I'm busy.,I am returning your many calls.
"Well, um, but if you have half an hour this afternoon, I just found this unit, it hasn't been on the market yet",I'm off the market for condos.,"Calm down, do you want this unit or not?"
James was right. I nEver had the teeniest chance of selling you anything.,Of course he was right. He doesn't stop giving good advice just because you're divorced. He's compulsive about remaining on good terms with his exes.,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, youd double their price."
Do you want to know why I named that dog Hector?,No. Let's keep it a mystery.,Because you sent away the dog!
"Because Even when he was a puppy, he was the worst-tempered dog we'd Ever seen he. He was supposed to be House-trained, but he'd pee on the carpet Every morning. When we had people over, he would nip at their ankles. Hector does go rug is an anagram for Doctor Greg House that's how early in the marriage I resented you.",Wow. Did I Ever waste money on that place setting.,"Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?"
James at least had the decency to feel guilty when he hurt me!,"Whereas I nEver hurt you! I nEver Even married you, clEverly hoping to avoid moments like this one.","Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night."
"You always needed him, and he was always there for you!","You keep yelling, and I'll think you owe me sex.","Without him, my lady, you would not be alive."
"You knew he had a wife waiting at home, you didn't care. I'm not saying you broke up the marriage, but you didn't help.","First, Hector does go rug is a lame anagram.","Oh really? Well, then youd better tell his other wife, cause she called three times asking where he is."
What are you doing?,Prepping for an aspiration. We still don't know what infection,"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions dont mean anything."
It's not going to help her.,"It's not going to hurt her. Well, it is going to hurt her, but",Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
"Well, it is going to hurt her, but No.","This will just take a few minutes. Grab a piece of an abscess, some pus",Shes not doing it to hurt you.
You really don't care.,You really don't care why she's going to be dead.,I dont care about that.
She's going to be dead,"WHAT? What did we screw up, what did we miss? I need to know.","Right, is it painful?"
Aren't you Ever gonna leave? No.,Yeah?,No Im staying.
I got your consent.,Her bra hook.,"Well, then, you have my permission."
Her bra hook. What?,She scratched herself with her bra hook. That's how the infection got in. Staph aureus.,"What? Were you like in the movie, or Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy."
She died from a simple Staph infection?,That and some bad decisions.,"Yeah, yeah, I was watching."
I'll be outside.,"Go home, have a few drinks, go to sleep, get up tomorrow, and do it tomorrow, only better.","Alright, but after this I want to see you outside."
I killed her.,"Yeah, me too.",You did kill her!
"This wasn't, oh, I should have thought of that idea sooner. This wasn't messing up a dosage. We see a disease rushing down on someone like a train, we can't always get them out of the way. But this wasn't that.",No.,"I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
So you're giving me numbers?,"Because they don't lie. I can't forgive you, Foreman, because there's nothing to forgive. He leaves.","Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again."
What'd you tell him?,That guilt is irrelevant.,What problem did you tell him you had?
You wanna get something to eat? They get into the elevator.,Can't. I've got a dog waiting at home.,Wait! Theyre using the lift as their own personal elevator.
I know. It's okay. Musta been a drag. We just had to make sure you weren't exposed to any bugs. Because your healthy bone marrow is what's gonna cure your brother's leukemia--,annoyed C'mon.,I am really sorry.

finishes writing Tell me about it. I can't Even find the one I've got working for me. Where is Foreman?,Ha! Nothing like a dead Patient to send you back to your choir-boy roots.,"Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc."
Ha! Nothing like a dead Patient to send you back to your choir-boy roots.,Hey! You're not gonna beliEve what happened. Wilson just killed a kid the same way you did.,Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
He's not dead.,Five days are gonna fly by.,"Hes dead. Hey, do you have any weed?"
reading from the file We should start the donor brother on broad-spectrum antibiotics.,"Great idea, if you're looking to save exactly one kid.",Your brothers turn will come.
Hector's my dog. He's about sEventeen.,SEventeen? That's like...a hundred and nineteen in huMan years. Why's he still alive?,"I love kids, how old is he?"
Blood panel was negative for all the usual suspects.,That's 'cause the infection is too small.,"Anyway, thats it."
"That's 'cause the infection is too small. We start testing now, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. We draw blood, odds are we're just gonna come up with hay. We need to grow more needles.","Okay, that...",Thats twice Ive warned you.
Making him sicker risks spreading the infection all throughout his body.,"True, but who cares? Once we know what the infection is, we'll know exactly how to treat it. As long as he isn't dead yet, we're cool.","But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them."
"We should do what we normally do - Go to the kid's House, check for sources of infection.",Waste of time. You think it's in the House. I know it's in the Patient.,"When you didnt come back, we went looking for you."
Safer than intentionally making the kid sicker.,beat Fine. Go.,Its never safe.

sighing This is your family. It needs to be your decision.,"All you had to do was say, Yes, I do. God knows that's a phrase you've used often enough in your life.","Ok, look! Enough! Alright? Im stepping in. Im putting my foot down! As your future husband Im going to make this decision for us. Now... what do you think we should do?"
It was a mistake Every time. Give it a break. They said yes.,That's not enough for you. You need them to feel good about saying yes.,I dont think hell be making that mistake again.
"arguing I treat Patients for months, maybe years, not weeks like you.",the argument-winner I'm taller.,I dont care about appointments!
"If they don't trust me, I can't do my job.",The only value of that trust is you can Manipulate them.,Trust? The men in this room.
You should write greeting cards.,Giving parents the chance to make a bad choice was a bad choice.,Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
At least it would've been their choice.,One they'd regret at their son's funeral.,"Theyre right, it was the only option."
He has acute scrotum.,"Adorable! Please, I thought you were dignified.",I tore my scrotum.
"Adorable! Please, I thought you were dignified.","Come on, how am I not supposed to make that joke? The best thing about big honkin' gonads -",So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?
Can Chase and Cameron cover that?,Mind if I ask why?,No. You know what? Dont. Dont. Lets let them think theyre getting away with it.
I want to recheck the national marrow registry for an alternate donor.,In case we're wrong?,"Oh, their number is on the contact sheet."
It's been known to happen.,Fine. Go.,"Yeah, this has happened before."
...mitral valve rules him out as a donor.,This is perfect.,Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.
We drove the infection into his heart.,Okay.,I put an arrow through his heart.
Remove the valve? He'll be fine on antibiotics. He doesn't need open heart surgery.,He'll be heart-broken on account of his dead brother.,Winterfell is your home.
"Either way, he's got a dead brother. The infection isn't just in the valve. Even with targeted medication, there's no way we can clear his system in time.","We don't have to. We have to clear his marrow. After the surgery, harvest the marrow, marinate it in the targeted antibiotic, simmer and serve.",Correct. Youre not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
I'm running this by Cuddy.,"nods Fine. Go. In fact, let's all go.","Giddy up, lets do this."
to House Do you have anything to add to this Debate?,"not looking at up from his magazine Wilson's right, Foreman's wrong, and your shirt is way too rEvealing for the office.","I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world."

Then why did you let him...?,Tried to cut him some slack.,And why I would let him do that?

And you're... giving him time to work through it?,"Mm-hmm! Four days, then he's fired. You don't get better from the yips.","No, Im waiting till hes in a good mood."
softly Open-heart surgery?,"If you want both kids to live, it's the only choice.","Oh, for Gods sake, just come to the play."
equally upset What about the marrow registry? Maybe they'll find a match.,cynically Maybe they'll ride it here on a unicorn.,Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
"sits down heavily, dejected Either we cripple one son or kill the other.",He won't be able to play baseball. But that doesn't make him a cripple.,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
You should protect your family as a whole. You should do the surgery.,That was awesome!,"Uh, well, Beth, I dont think your decision should be based on politics."
quietly Shut up.,I gotta start pretending to care.,You need to keep quiet.
I did exactly what Cuddy told us not to do.,"No, you didn't. You did exactly what she told me not to do. You're completely in the clear.",I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuarts date with Penny.
"No, you didn't. You did exactly what she told me not to do. You're completely in the clear.",You've gotta be kidding me. You're actually upset. You just said what you beliEved.,Huh... We didnt do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
I also beliEve in Patients making their own choices.,Because it lessens your guilt if things go wrong. You're not protecting your choices.,"Well, I was wondering if youd like to get dinner again sometime."
Because it lessens your guilt if things go wrong. You're not protecting your choices.,You're soothing your conscience.,So that you will intentionally do something thattheylltheyll intentionally screw it up?

Or... it could be infection.,"My memory's not what it used to be, but didn't we just rule that out eight seconds ago?","Good point, but, thought of that already."
Just because it's not what screwed up his valve doesn't mean it's not in his system.,"Uh-huh, and it has the obvious advantage of making us right all along. A little disadvantage of making big brother dead.",I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.

I tortured the kid.,Because you knew it was right. You knew you were saving his brother.,"I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother."
"pensively I know. I don't like that I know. I hate that I can listen to a kid screaming in pain and not Even take a moment to question whether I'm doing the right thing. I hate that in order to be like you as a doctor, I have to be like you as a huMan being. I don't want to turn into you.",smirks You're not. You've been like me since you were eight years old.,AND IM A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DONT HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
I nEver Even hit her.,Smiling. Morning. This is funny Holds up his coffee and starts to read the side. People don't...,And I dont support her choice to hit you.
"Bronchoscopy was pristine, so much for the lungs.",Comes back out. Good morning.,It wasnt even very good.
"Which means no ulcer or GI bleed. Which means it's not from her stomach, either. Which means it didn't come from anywhere.",Comes back out. You guys get to the point where the blood didn't come from anywhere?,"Okay, I understand everyones a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff."
"Rupture in her sinus cavity, dripped through the back.",Not that much blood.,Hey. You got a minute?
Trauma from karate?,No trauma. She kicked the other guy's ass.,"You know, I dont know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day."
Now a good time?,If you can tell me how blood can mysteriously appear in a!,"Uh, is this not a good time or."
What's going on?,Closing the door. Feel free to speculate amongst yourselves.,"Oh, wow, its almost time for ultra feast!"
Yeah. Why?,He's afraid of turning into me.,"Yeah, whats the reason?"
Good luck. Thank you.,That's it? You're not going to tell him that we're a family and families don't abandon each other?,We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help.
You want me to?,No.,Dyou want to?
"Good luck, Dr. Foreman. Hugs Foreman then leaves.","So, where were we?","Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler."
College sophomore coughing up blood.,"Not the case, the speculation. The palace intrigue. The rising self-doubts. Did Foreman get a promotion?","So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night."
I resigned. What?,Personally I can't beliEve I've had the same three employees for three years.,"My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!"
Patient could have a heart pRoblem.,Yes. Life goes on. Look at the eager beaver combing his hair.,I am so hot for you right now.
"Hyperdynamic heart could force too much blood into her lungs, she coughed up the overflow. Wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs because it's travelling through normal plumbing.","Foreman, go do a stress echo test to see if he's right.","Well, who cares what I think?"
What? A brain pRoblem? Messed up hypothalamus could cause goose bumps but they're not going to cause her to cough up blood. She has no neurological issues. She had a shiver.,I think there's an infection.,"Okay, literal goose bumps."
"We've ruled out infection because no fEver, no white count. They stop in front of Wilson's office.",I think there's an infection.,"Hey, so hows the direct mail business going?"
Why's Foreman quitting?,He wants to breed llamas. Starts to walk towards Wilson's office.,"Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?"
"Interesting. House turns around. You're ashamed of the reason, too. House smiles and continues on his way, Chase leaves in the direction Foreman did.",Takes the coffee and sits down. No one writes tamoxifen like you.,"Oh, well, Im going to the kitchen, Ill walk with you."
"Well, I use a G.",Foreman resigned.,I type 90.
Stops writing. I'm sorry.,It's okay. No biggie.,"If you stop crying, Ill stop writing it."
Rolls his eyes. Right. He give a reason?,He said he didn't want to end up like me. I had a brilliant retort. Can't remember what it was at the moment.,"Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you."
You don't want to end up like you.,Good point. Can I resign? Wilson yawns. What's up with that?,"Whatever you do, just dont make any rash decisions."
What's up with that? With what?,You yawned.,Whats with you?
"My heart's fine, I was up late. You're just deflecting having a conversation about Foreman.",I'm ok with Foreman leaving.,"Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you."
"Either you're lying, or you don't really think he's leaving, or you just jumped right to acceptance. House yawns.",Sorry. I yawned because I was trying to communiCate boredom.,"Im telling you, theres no way hes moving back."
"You could try bargaining with him, give him a raise.",How much do you think it would cost to make him want to be like me? Silence. Thanks for the coffee. Leaves.,Im not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.
She seems fine.,She is fine.,I think shes OK.
She coughed up blood.,Past tense.,Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
She has diarrhoea.,From the antibiotics for the infection.,Doesnt really poop.
Lung biopsy says she doesn't have an infection.,"Well, then, you screwed up the biopsy.","Hi. Im good. Really good. Well, I dont know why I said really good. Im just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really."
Or you're wrong about infection.,"Well if I'm wrong, then so is her body, because it obviously thinks she's got an infection or it wouldn't have gotten better from the antibiotics.","So, where were we?"
Does this have anything to do with Addie?,Lets say yes.,"Umm, really, its nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was"
"Cerebral tumour, epilepsy! Could also be a medication reaction to antidepressants or some meds for end stage liver failure.",Lets say no.,"Nothing! Well, II got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious."
"But now you are? No, now you're nervous, uncomfortable about your decision. It wasn't Even that good a joke.",Oh crap.,No I wasnt.
Most of your jokes are excellent. Cameron rolls her eyes. I just meant in comparison.,Shut up. I think she may not have an infection. You better deal with her before she crashes.,"I wasnt making a joke, I was merely stating fact."
"Heart was fine, liver enzymes were normal.",Looking at the chart.,She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to Kings Landing.
Labs indiCated minute traces of blood.,"Can't ignore the blood because it's a minority, can you, Foreman?","I gotta tell you guys, Im a little worried about Sheldon."
"If we count the traces of blood as significant, the differential isn't just infection. It could be lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma.","Great. Go tell her she's got one of those. Or you could tell her we haven't given her enough antibiotics for her INFECTION. Double the dose, and check her lungs.","You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people."
"We checked her lungs, they're clean.",Leaving. On the outside. She needs an arteriogram.,"No, lets just leave the lights on."
It's about my bowel movements.,"What isn't, these days? Shuts the door. Points to Steve's girlfriend, Honey. You sure you want to be here for this?","Leonard, Im not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements."
We do Everything together.,"Of course. The toilet can be a lonely place. Drop your pants, I'll suit up.","For starters, we enjoy spending time together."
Dropping his pants. They float.,Huh?,"Pants, but Leonard says sex doesnt count."
I'm a nutritionist. Smiles.,"Yes, I could tell from the cool toe-loop sandals.","Now that Im back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control."
"Yes, I could tell from the cool toe-loop sandals. Thank you.",You're welcome. They smile at each other. And the natural fibre clothing I assume means some kind of vegetarian denomination?,"Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. Im bad at small talk."
We're vegans. At first I was a little concerned about the lack of protein but Honey showed me you can get it from lots of...,"Well, whatEver floats your poop. And you've been together how long? 6 months?",Sorry doesnt make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy.
How'd you know?,Because after 6 months poop love fades and if you've been together shorter than that then... I'll explain right after this break. Leaves.,What do you need from the car?
Because after 6 months poop love fades and if you've been together shorter than that then... I'll explain right after this break. Leaves.,Three 10-milligram pills of your finest amphetamines. Signs the book.,Because you shouldnt be with him.
Which means her lungs are fine.,What if the clear arteriogram is significant?,Look at that form.
It is significant. It means there's no infection.,I think there's an infection.,Typically thats an indicator.
"Infections don't come and go, people don't get better then worse on the same treatment.",Unless her body can't finish off the fight maybe goes a couple of rounds then gives up.,I didnt think you could keep it a secret.
Why would it give up?,Maybe its name is Foreman.,Maybe it committed suicide!
Blood panel and enzymes show her proteins are normal.,"You can't have tested for Every protein, I can think of at least one you can't test for at all.","Hey, Im in a hospital and Im not the patient."
Complement factor-H deficiency. But if she has that she's dead. No way to fend off bacteria. She'll get one infection after another until her body shuts down.,Maybe we can get ahead of the game. Manage each symptom as it comes up. Give her five miserable years instead of six miserable months.,I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
There's no diagnostic test for complement factor-H deficiency.,So we isolate the cells that are yummiest for it.,I dont think theres anything.
"What? No, I'm not.","Oh, yes you are.","No. No, Im not."
Looks disappointed. It's ok. I get it.,"Confused. Well I was going to say relax but, oddly enough, you seem pretty relaxed already.","Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie."
You're accomplished. You're funny. You can have whatEver you want. Women are going to...,"He's not cheating with another Woman, he's cheating with another food group.","Your no Gods gift to women, thats all in your headdddd."
"He's not cheating with another Woman, he's cheating with another food group. Angry. What?",His floaters float because they're full of fat. PRobably had a big cheeseburger for lunch.,Hes upset because he cant get anywhere with women.
"Soy cakes taste like cardboard, unsalted cardboard.",I'm accomplished. I'm funny. Can I have whatEver I want? Steve is shocked. Honey smiles.,"Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor."
"Addie this all looks really scary, but you'll feel nothing, ok? Ok.",You rang?,Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok.
You called me.,I bought you an espresso.,Dont call me
Suspicious. How did you walk with the cane and the two coffees?,Laughs. Why are you suspicious?,How do you take your coffee?
"Because it's either that, or accept the fact that you've done something nice. And then I have to deal with the horsemen and the rain of fire and the end of days.","Laughs again. What, you think I spat in yours?","Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just."
"What, you think I spat in yours? Or worse.",I stacked them.,You know youve been spitting on me?
"I stacked them. Puts the left one on top of the right and lifts it up to demonstrate, then puts the left one down again and holds out the right one to Wilson.","What do you think of me hiring a nutritionist instead of a neurologist? I mean, they sound almost the same.","Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit."
I take it you've met a hot nutritionist.,Don't cheapen this. We had an in-depth conversation about proteins and fats. I was about to examine her boyfriend's rectum.,"Ooh, thats a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl."
You asked for a date while your finger was in her boyfriend?,Got her number.,I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.
"No, no. No way. House pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to Wilson. This is an employment application. She doesn't want to go out with you she's looking for a job. Oh, God. She's 26.",But with the wisdom of a much younger Woman.,Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Have you spoken to Foreman?,SEveral times. We laugh...,Yes. I need to speak to him.
You're going to lose him.,"And that will be depressing. But it will only make me appreciate all the good things that I do have. House goes into the Diagnostics Office, Wilson leaves.",Im the head accountant.
Which means we should be looking for a tumour.,I think there's an infection. Just because the cells in her eye aren't dead yet doesn't mean they're working.,Oh you had said that you dont do anything personal during work time so.
So why did we do the test.,Because if it had been positive it would have proved I was right.,The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
But negative doesn't prove you wrong.,Smiling. That's the beauty of the test.,"Or, we can prove them wrong."
She needs an MRI of her brain.,"Absolutely. Ducklings start to leave. As long as you're scanning, you mind having a boo for an abscess or something caused by an infection? Ducklings leave.","What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?"
My head. Starts screaming. Cameron gets her out of the maParkne. My head! The camera pans round to rEveal her head. Open. Bleeding. We can see her brain.,Grody.,"Ross hikes the ball to Chandler, and the camera pans down to show Rachel standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum."
Looks like massive tissue death.,Who cares? Her head blew up. How cool is that?,"Oh, my god, Im so sorry."
It's not pusy.,"Turns the camera on Cameron. Meaning you don't think it's an infection, and you'd be right, if you weren't wrong. Puts the camera back on the open head.","Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really."
Here we go again.,"She's got infections that come and go, which means...",There you go again.
It means it has to be something else!,"Good guess, but no!",This has to mean something.
You enjoying this?,I'm saving a Woman's life.,You having fun?
An autoimmune pRoblem makes more sense.,You can't explain transudative pleural effusion with giant cell arteritis. You'd need three whiteboards and 100 different coloured markers.,"Oh, yeah, theyre falling in love all over again."
"If it's autoimmune she can live, but we have to give her steroids, now, before her heart ruptures.","If you're wrong, and you give her steroids, she dies, now.","Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute."
Takes a deep breath. Ready.,My Patient's about to have a heart attack. Smiles. It's going to be massive!,Ready? What the hell are you still doing here?
Oh well that's too bad cause I just got tickets to a stroke on the third floor. Have you had a conversation with Foreman?,Pulls out some money. Can you do me a favour?,"Ill go. Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?"
"You haven't, because then you would have to confront your own emotions.",Is bile an emotion?,"Not compared to me, you havent."
You dosed me!,"Yes... I did, but only because you didn't trust me! Your best friend.",You helped me get off drugs!
Walks in You could have killed me!,Amphetamines aren't going to kill you. Shuts the door.,You said come in!
You don't know my medical history! I c-c-c-c... I could've... You could've given me a heart attack.,"Laughs. Well, a heart attack is not going to kill you. You were in a hospital. Wilson yawns. Aha! You yawned!","For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned."
Aha! You tried to kill me.,I put you on uppers and you still yawned.,Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?!
I'm not on antidepressants I'm on SPEEEEEED!,Well that means it's a symptom of a cerebral tumour.,Are you still taking the antidepressants?
It's not a secret. House it's-it's... it's personal!,How long has it been personal?,"Oh, its a secret."
How long has it been personal? It's personal!,Yawning's recent so! either you just started or you changed prescription.,So I guess I can assume that was personal.
Holds out his hands. This is why I take them.,"They're antidepressants, not anti-annoyance-ants. You'd think this would naturally come up in conversation with...","And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two."
Oh don't act hurt. You don't care!,On one of those occasions when you're pompously lecturing me on what to do to fix my life.,"Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!"
"You wouldn't take them! You'd rather OD on Vicodin or stick electrodes in your head, because you can say you did it to get high. The only reason to take antidepressants is because you're depressed. You! you have to admit that you're depressed.",Give me. Holds out his hand.,"Oh, Im on so many antidepressants, I couldnt if I wanted to."
Are you going to admit that...,Nope. I'm going to prove that I'm not depressed.,Admit it. Admit it.
Haha. Shakes his head... Well I can't give you my prescription. You've got to meet with a psyParkatrist. You need a whole work up. Breathing heavily. Give me a Vicodin so I don't stroke. House chucks him the bottle. Wilson pops a pill. And grabs a coffee cup off the side table.,I! wouldn't drink that. Wilson stares at him. My leg hurt and I! points towards the bathroom. Wilson puts the cup down.,"Oh my God, is it really that bad?"
House. House is startled awake. Why didn't you pick up the phone? We've been calling.,I was sleeping.,Howards bedroom. The phone is ringing.
What did you do?,Nothing! This is how regular people look when you wake them up.,"Oh, not since we broke up."
Hemolytic uremic syndrome shut down Addie's kidneys. Peripheral smear of red cells had sParkstocytes.,Huh.,A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.
"Doesn't mean you're right. You predicted cardiac arrest, INSTANT cardiac arrest.","There were only two choices, since yours was wrong, mine must have been right. Either that or we missed the leprechaun.","Central Perk, time lapse, Rachel is at the counter as Jill enters."
"If you're right then there's nothing to be done. The steroid treatment we gave her means when the next infection hits it'll hit hard. Liver failure, cardiac arrest.","But on the bright side, it confirms my diagnosis.",And here we have Mister Rogers Neighborhood.
She's going to die.,"That's not my fault. She was going to die anyway. Now, thanks to me, at least she'll know why.",Shes gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
I'm sure you'll see that gratitude in her eyes when you tell her.,I'm not telling her.,"She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing andand, appreciate it."
I'm not telling her.,No one's telling her. Not until we're sure I'm right.,"No, no, dont tell her."
But we're going to wait for her to stroke or have a heart attack to confirm before we tell her?,Seems like the huMane approach. Leaves and goes into his office.,"So, should we tell her?"
"Her heart went into V-fib. Brought her back, barely. Congratulations, you have your confirmation. House gets up and starts to leave, presumably to tell Addie she is going to die. Foreman calls out after him. What's her name?",Who? The co-ed?,Her names Ronni.
The co-ed? Sure.,Thinks. Dead sophomore girl?,The girls school?
You know her father's name?,Dad. Her mother's name is Mommy.,You know her?
"Ben and Jodie are about to lose their only daughter, Addie.",You think they're going to give a crap if I know their names?,I hope Ben has a little sister.
You saying you don't want me to quit?,Didn't sound like I said that.,You wanna quit?
"You are about to tell a girl she is dying and you think it's about you. God, I hope I'm not you. Leaves.",I'm sorry. Addie you're dying.,"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right."
Are you sure?,Yes. Your infections will get worse. The toxins will spill into your blood.,"Well, shes not throwing up, which is a good sign."
The toxins will spill into your blood. How long?,"Two days, maybe less. You have a condition called...",You wont even taste it?
Does it matter.,It's a very rare protein deficiency that only...,"The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
I don't want to hear it.,Ok.,"I will not hear it, not from you."
"Please, could you just leave?","Smiling. What's the point in living,without curiosity? Without craving the...","Okay, look, Im gonna have to ask you all to leave."
Get out of here.,Smiling still. It's-it's-it's like the... dark matter in the universe...,"Oh, get out of here!"
dark matter in the universe... You're smiling.,"No I'm not. You can only diagnose a pRoblem by looking at what's... Sees a reflection on himself, smiling. missing... Oh, God. I have to go. Leaves.","Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter."
Leaves. Startled. Ahh.,"Loudly. 19-year-old didn't want to hear the coolest explanation of why she's going to die. Shuts the door, loudly. Begged me to shut up. Turns the light on.","Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll..."
If you can't shut up at least talk quietly.,Amphetamine withdrawal's a bitch. She thought that I was happy.,You never used to shut up.
Sits up. You were happy?,No!,Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
I told you. You got to be checked out by...,"No, you just didn't want me double dosing. Wilson starts looking guilty. He knows the game's up. You dosed me! Those coffees...","Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didnt realise that had become anything, yet."
"They worked! You've been smiling, relaxed, happy!",A dying girl thought I was happy. A moron thought I was happy. Who the hell doesn't want to know why she's dying?,I can tell from your expressions that thats the good news you were hoping for.
House was happy.,Hazy.,He seems pleased.
Hazy. Happy.,Hazy!,A little frazzled.
"Oh, right. A dying girl mistook hazy for happy, because dying people see happiness Everywhere. She's miserable.",She wasn't miserable.,I think she meant something a little happier.
Of course she was miserable you just told her she was...,She was no different then she's Ever been.,"She could have made you happy, for a little while."
"She was no different then she's Ever been. Epiphany. She was no different than she'd Ever been.... Oh, God. I got to go. Leaves and slams the door behind him, much to the dismay of Wilson who cringes and rubs his face.",Need a minute with your daughter.,"She, she was different."
Dr. House get out of here before...,She's going to live. Does that help? Now get out.,"Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, its time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?"
Are you jerking us around?,Get out!,"Oh, pulling strings, are we?"
"I'm dying, I'm not depressed.",Wrong and wrong.,Im not depressed Im in grief.
Starts to cry. Can you fix me?,Surgery to fix the bridge will take about 2 hours. Psychotherapy is going to take a little longer. Why'd you do it?,"No! Look, I dont cry! Its not a big deal! Okay?!"
"I don't know. I've just! nEver been happy. Crying. Please don't tell my parents. They'll blame themselves and it's not their fault. Please, you can't tell them.","Technically, all you have to do is promise me that you wont do it again. Then, legally I can't tell them.","Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear."
Composes herself. I promise.,"Yeah, sure.",I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.
We can't thank you...,Your daughter tried to kill herself.,Im sorry... we... we cant.
"Which makes sense, she's obviously an adult, capable of her own well-reasoned decisions. You're sure?","If she doesn't die in the next couple of hours, yeah, I'm right.","Well, Im not so sure about that."
How could she hide this?,Everyone has secrets.,How could you have told her?
"We'll take care of her, figure it out.",You'll make her happy?,"Hey, we can take her back with you if you want."
We'll get her into therapy.,"Nods. Might want to try some meds, too. Starts to leave.",Im gonna take her back to the appartment.
Follows him. Can we call you? House turns around. If we have any questions? Smiles.,No. Jodie is shocked. House leaves.,Joey enters his hotel room.
I didn't think you were going to show.,Sorry. Surgery went a little late.,"Oh, I thought you werent coming."
So you really think I have all the necessary qualifications?,I can't discuss this with a dry mouth. What have you got there?,"Excuse me, but I think Im just as qualified as you are."
What have you got there? Peppermint tea.,To the barMan. I'm going to have a mug of peppermint tea please.,"What did you do, put this in your tea?"
"This isn't a job interview, is it?","It's some kind of interview. You're judging me, I'm judging you.","Its a job interview, not a flea market."
You have the upper hand. I don't know anything about you.,I'm on antidepressants because a doctor friend of mine thinks I'm miserable.,Oh really?! You think youre stronger? Why dont you prove it?
You don't seem depressed.,You do realise you just skipped over sEveral deep character flaws that most women would run screaming from?,Its been a long time since weve come down here separately.
You told the truth.,"Yeah... I don't always do that, either.",And I lied to you.
"Well, how miserable can you be saving lives, sleeping around and doing drugs? Smiles.","Were you on the Debating team in high school? BarMan pours House's tea. Also... Picking it up. I hate tea. Drinks it, then smiles.",I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery.
I hate this... kid.,I like this kid.,"Take that, kid."
You haven't met him.,I know you hate him.,"Well, then can we meet him?"
Nate went mEdieval on the other kid. Could be...,Hold on. closing his eyes I'm having a moment. This... imitates choking back a sob this could be Foreman's last time mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.,That doesnt matter to me at all.
Which could create excess adrenaline. Causes the head pain and rage.,But not the personality disorder.,I wouldnt say a rage.
There is no personality disorder. He's a teenager.,"Being a teenager excuses the odd inappropriate comment. This kid say anything appropriate? announcing He's having cluster headaches. PRobably been having them for years. Question is, what's causing them?","Oh yes! Monica, get in here! Theres a highspeed car chase on!"
"If it were just a cluster headache, he'd have swelling around the eyes.",ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain. Useless for this pain. It could have knocked down the swelling. Best bet is a vascular pRoblem.,"Yeah, no. Shes not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here."
"reads a file Normal treatment for cluster headaches is steroids, which the ER also gave him. He's still in pain. Which means...",turns around Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.,"Pull over! Youre not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Dont make this difficult, Dwight!"
turns around Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.,Don't you dare... touch that acerbic wit.,"Yeah, its crazy, but it totally works."
shrugging I thought I was a bad mother. And I hated myself. Because I hated him.,vo What do you got for me this...,"You know, Ive always blamed myself for him leaving."
vo What do you got for me this...,... fine morning?,You have Valentines plans?
Blood thinners and TMS had no effect. It's not cluster headaches.,You accusing the symptoms of lying?,I dont have a headache.
Could be hemochromatosis.,Wouldn't account for the personality disorder.,"Yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
What about hypothyroidism?,"He's not getting aggressive and lethargic, he's getting aggressive and aggressiver.","I mean, its pretty broken already."
What about ruptured dermoid cyst?,Sorry. Just got dizzy there. I was expecting to turn right. It's Foreman's turn to be shot down.,Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list.
hardly amused The thing that Cameron said.,Way to think outside the box.,What?! What else did he say?
Way to think outside the box.,But no fat in the ventricles. It's cluster headaches.,"Well, Id say thats thinking outside the box, but, come on."
Normal treatment didn't work. Abnormal treatment didn't work.,"Good point, Foreman!","Come on, Rach."
"Good point, Foreman!",The treatments don't always work. Symptoms nEver lie.,"That is a very good point, Dwight."
The only approved treatment left for cluster headaches is brain surgery. And that's not Even a guarantee.,"shouting into Foreman's ear Back off, Foreman!","You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp."
"shouting into Foreman's ear Back off, Foreman!","If the approved treatment doesn't work, we go with an unapproved treatment.","Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!"
"If the approved treatment doesn't work, we go with an unapproved treatment. Hey!",Something on your mind?,"Okay, you got me there."
Something on your mind?,Because you totally can't tell.,Is something bothering you?
I had a job interview lined up at New York Mercy yesterday.,Hospital for Manhattan's glitterati. Big coup. Your homies must be kvelling.,"Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!"
"mad Didn't happen, because apparently I called to cancel. I don't remember making that call. You think I have neurological issue?",Yes.,You think Im mad.
shouting Why are you jerking me around?,It wasn't me.,"Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!"
"Yeah! It was one of the other petty, socially repressed asses I work for.",Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.,"Yeah, somebody once did that in my office."
"If you want me to stay, tell me you want me to stay.",Would it matter?,I want me to stay too.

So it's relapsing and remitting. Maybe... porphyria.,"Nah, that's a stretch. If she had porphyria, you would have seen purple urine.","I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day Im receptionist again."
You think it's more likely he cured polio?,They beliEve it.,"Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?"
"They beliEve it. Her symptoms fit perfectly. And the alternative is unbelievably convoluted. Some doctor would have to poison her with thallium so it looks like polio, then fake a lab test, then give her Vitamin C and stop the poison so she magically gets better. as if just realizing Actually... to Brennan it is kinda doable, right?",So what do you think? Should we test her for thallium before you contact Stockholm?,"Oh, theyre forming an alliance"
So what do you think? Should we test her for thallium before you contact Stockholm?,The really shocking thing is that Foreman was right about the heatstroke.,I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.
persistent Vitamin C cures polio. I've seen it.,Yeah. In some bush clinic. You needed polio in a place with a proper lab. The only pRoblem is that places with proper labs don't have polio.,No. Hes a theoretical physicist at Caltech.
to Foreman and House And what do you care if I faked a lab test if it saves a few thousand lives? I did what I had to do. Isn't that what you hired us for?,"nods, sighs Which is why I'm not gonna fire you.","Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?"
"nods, sighs Which is why I'm not gonna fire you.",You're gonna quit.,"Oh thats cool, I was gonna fire you anyway."
You're gonna quit.,"Go on, get outta here.",So.... I quit.
So you're just gonna let him go?,Absolutely.,"Seriously, let him go."
to the fellows Who the hell did I leave in charge? Foreman.,"There was a reason for that. Next time, listen to him.",Im Dale. He left me in charge.
Where have you been? And don't say the CIA.,"Okay. By the way, one of my employees...","The government, spy satellites, private detectives."
"Either you're gonna have to get someone from the CIA to call and confirm your story, or smiling you're doing eight clinic hours and Wilson is doing sixteen.",seriously I was in the Hamptons. I was helping some rich hedge-fund jerk treat his son's sniffles. Fascinating as that sounds.,"Dr. Koothrappali? Im Special Agent Page, FBI. May I come in?

"For your honesty, I will forgive _your_ hours.",Thank you.,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?

suspicious Why are you glad Foreman's not here?,Because... he would object to what I'm about to do.,Michael. Whys everyone locked in the conference room?
Because... he would object to what I'm about to do.,to the tech Hey buddy!,And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Why did you hire her?,Because she has way more diagnostic experience than the other swimsuit models I was considering.,"Oh yeah, she didnt hire me out of pity, it wasnt so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks Im good."
Simple. His big head. Increased intracranial pressure would cause heart block.,Wrong. Sixteen years they've been testing that insane noggin to death.,Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didnt know how big he was gonna be.

"A 'D' cup? beat If she's no good, just fire her.",I can't! I just hired her. She left a career.,Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.
It wasn't drugs.,"Well, then give me something better. What's causing heart block?",Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
Could be toxoplasmosis. We should do an LP to test for infection.,"If it was toxoplasmosis, we'd've seen enlarged lymphs.",I moved back here a couple of months ago.

"Stomach cancer. Tumor causes bleeding, body's reaction to the tumor causes paraneoplastic syndrome which leads to heart block.","Finally! Someone who is NOT just a pretty face. You and Taub, run the 'scope, find the tumor.",I wouldnt own the company if it wasnt for you.
Ah... could be dangerous. If the bleeding was caused by liver failure as a result of the intracranial pressure....,Liver is the one organ you can't ascribe to intracranial pressure.,"Yeah, thats a real pickle."
No. Literally a witch hunt. Dr. House is a practicing Wiccan. It's a beautiful religion. It's very caring.,"Hey, hey, hey hey! House puts his face into the shot. Very annoyed.

...that this kid's gonna die because you won't put down that camera?,At all? You know?,That that bird was dead?
You people should be extra motivated. I'm sure they all want to look good in the film.,sarcastically Patient No. Now they're too worried about looking BAD.,They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Heart block plus liver failure could mean auto-immune. Maybe scleroderma.,out of the corner of his mouth Foreman? Does that make sense?,"Hey, for what its worth, with Rachel I dont think youll ever be just anybody."
Liver failure plus heart block could be a mitochondrial disorder.,Hey. Say what she just said.,"Do as youre bid, child."
confused Liver failure plus heart block could be a mitochondrial disorder?,Go look for signs of retinal degeneration.,"Hey, Penny, its Leonard."
No. It's ICP. You're only going to see swelling.,"Take him with you, so he can see the degeneration too.","Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?"
... there's increased pressure in his brain.,Absolutely.,"Plus, improves your reflexes see, I would have caught that."
So now we can reschedule the reconstruction.,Absolutely not.,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
Your test proved you wrong. We found exactly what I predicted we'd find.,Swelling means there's increased pressure. You get a gold Star of David for proving that...,"Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis."
Swelling means there's increased pressure. You get a gold Star of David for proving that...,"...yes, this kid has a big head and big heads cause pressure. Doesn't explain the liver.","Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume.

The father refused steroids until we're sure about the diagnosis.,I AM sure. turns It's JRA.,"Monica and Rachels, time lapse."
I AM sure. turns It's JRA.,"And why would he Even doubt that, unless a FORMER fellow of mine was Parkrping in his ear.","Im positive. Yeah, oh, and heres your expense receipts right there."
The decision was his. I merely voiced my concern.,Why did you take this job?,"Yeah, I didnt have much say in that."
He's got a bulging cyst...,You had a perfectly good plastic surgery practice... lots of money.,Hey! Its me. Monica! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.

He needs surgery.,"Oh, and I think I mentioned this earlier - you're fired.",Just tell her Ill talk to her later.
Where are you going?,To do what I always do in these situations.,That is so cool.
To do what I always do in these situations.,Treat my Patient behind his back.,to take the responsibility yourself!
"That's one option.beat Or you can do a CT scan of the kid's head. If there's no mid-line shift, we know Taub's wrong and you get your consent to give the kid steroids.","Just a warning.

"Oh. Well, then, I guess my answer wasn't very helpful, was it?",Mini-stud. Stand up.,"Oh. Well, now Im sorry I asked."
Mini-stud. Stand up.,I spoke to your other partner.,"Stand, boy. We dont kneel for anyone beyond the Wall."
After Cuddy told you...,"No, I stayed away. Did it all over the phone. I asked for a reference, said you were applying for a plastic surgery job.","Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?"
"I asked for a reference, said you were applying for a plastic surgery job. Oh, God.",Yeah. beat He went nuts. Apparently you signed a non-compete. Now why would you agree to that?,"Yeah, well at least I didnt suck at customer relations."
I don't want to practice plastic surgery.,"You sign a contract because someone's making you, someone's getting something from you. coldly What did they give you in return?","Suit yourself. But, if it were me, Botox , wig ."

Let us try and fill our spare time with a new challenge. The winner gets immunity...,"The Hallway, Ross is eagerly waiting for the others to get ready, to go to the hospital."
I have a sick guy. I saw this magician last night...,The girl's fine. He didn't really cut her in half.,"Hey! Look at what youre wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magicians assistant? Thats..."

"If I'm right, do I stay?","If I say no, are you going to let your Patient die?","If I dont return, youll know I was wrong."

I didn't screw up that trick.,"Everything that's happened can be explained by you being forgetful and incompetent. You screwed up, you passed out...","Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I cant believe that I screwed it up so bad."
Know my favourite time to lie? When my life hangs in the balance.,Your life doesn't hang in the balance. You know your life doesn't hang in the balance. Your reputation might hang...,"And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachels bag you will find a halfeaten box of cookies in there."

Holds the cards out to House. Pick a card.,Too much trouble. Can I just pick my nose?,"OK, so now we draw cards."
I am not a hack.,Takes a card.,"Life hacking, man."
I don't screw up. Finn starts bleeding heavily from his nose.,A nosebleed that major means he's actually sick. Means the cardiac arrest was a symptom. Looks at Kutner. Stop gloating.,Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
I'm not gloating.,Then what's that smirk?,"Shut up, Im happy."
What about the underwear challenge?,I declare it officially on hold.,"But um, heres an idea, have you ever worn womens underwear?"
"Not really fair, but I get it. Throws a pair of red panties on the table, Everyone is surprised, House looks at Amber. Amber stands up and pulls her skirt down a little to show that she is still wearing hers. House looks over at 13 who looks disgusted by the thought. It's Cuddy's.",To Cole.

"I know. Hypothetical. A young Woman does something clumsy in public, and instead of laughing it off, she gets irrationally upset. Explain.",But this girl's not insecure. Seems more like she's afraid.,People do stupid things when theyre upset.
But this girl's not insecure. Seems more like she's afraid.,I think you're hiding a medical condition.,"Well, I cant believe youd say that."
I think you're hiding a medical condition.,"Doctors often try to ignore their symptoms because they think they can't get sick. If you've got something going on, I need you to take care of it.",Bored of you?
"Doctors often try to ignore their symptoms because they think they can't get sick. If you've got something going on, I need you to take care of it.","It's not compassion. It's self interest, I want my team healthy.","Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everythings peachy."
"It's not compassion. It's self interest, I want my team healthy.",Okay.,Thats it? No compassion?
What are you giving me?,How'd you do the trick?,What can I get you?
"Oh, if I explain it becomes mundane, and you lose the actual magic.",What do you mean the actual magic? Think you're actually sawing women in half?,"So you might say, its a magic ring."
You going to tell me what's wrong with me or not?,Connects the IV up. Magic is cool. Actual magic is oxymoronic. Might not Even be oxy.,I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.
You're not going to tell me unless I tell you? Laughs.,You got a nurse to plant the card.,I am not going to tell you yet.
I can't get a nurse to help me pee.,You got a buddy to plant the card.,I need to pee.
The fun is in not knowing.,"Grabs some scissors and cuts the IV line, Finn is shocked. The fun... House opens his hand to rEveal it was just a trick. Is in knowing.","Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own."
"Grabs his head. Oh, my head. Oh! I got a headache.",How bad? Is it new?,Cradle my head!
"It's not too bad. I'll-I'll just take one of these... Pours pills from one hand into the other. Vicodin. House grabs the now empty Vicodin bottle out of his pocket. Sticks his hand out to get the pills back, Finn holds his hand over House's and then opens it, but nothing falls out. House rolls his eyes.","You eat a lot of beets, you have an electric toothbrush, and you sleep less than six hours a night.","Okay. Well, you kids have fun. Im gonna go to sleep."
"You eat a lot of beets, you have an electric toothbrush, and you sleep less than six hours a night. That's impressive.","The red betamine from the beets stains the plaque deposits on your teeth, which are then swirled by your spinning toothbrush.","Well, those are indicators that Im farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human."
That was way cooler before you explained it.,It was meaningless until I explained it.,That was really cool.
People come to my show because they want a sense of wonder. They WANT to experience something that they can't explain.,"If the wonder's gone when the truth is known, there nEver was any wonder.",It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
"If the wonder's gone when the truth is known, there nEver was any wonder. You have tularaemia from your rabbits. I've put you on antibiotics, you'll be better in a couple of days. Sorry to spoil the mystery. Leaves.",Thank you. Pops a pill.,"Im on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders Ive found ever since."
I'll get it. Bends down to pick up the Vicodin and House checks out her ass.,Eyes boggle. Oh. My. God. Cuddy looks at him. You're not wearing underwear.,Andand then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Of course I'm...,"Skirt that tight, you've got no secrets. Skirt that tight, I can tell if you've got an IUD. You seen Dr. Cole?","Hes handsome, hes lanky, hes brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality."
Cole? No.,You're blushing.,No. Roy? No.
I am not. Looks down away from House as she hands House his pills.,"Look at me. Cuddy looks up at him for a second, House looks into her eyes as he grabs the pills. His eyes boggle again. Oh! Cuddy leaves. My! God!",Trust? The men in this room.
"Look at me. Cuddy looks up at him for a second, House looks into her eyes as he grabs the pills. His eyes boggle again. Oh! Cuddy leaves. My! God!",How'd you do it?,Now hes movin?
So I'm safe?,"In this job, yeah. Cole smiles. Crotch, on the other hand... How'd you do it?","Dont worry, everyone in here is safe."
"Prayer mostly. Elevator dings, then opens, Cole walks out down the corridor and House follows.","Just tell me, does Cuddy have her groove back?",How the hell did you get in the building?
It'd be rude of me to discuss.,You handed over her panties. I don't think gallantry's really an option at this point.,I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
The antibiotics aren't working. It's obviously not tularaemia or any other infection.,"Excuse me, we were talking.","Yeah... well, its been hard, theyre wearing the exact same uniform. And Ive been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike."
"Bleeding around the heart could mean botched biopsy, when Cole was looking for the...",Why would you accuse the Man who decides your fate of screwing up?,"Oh. Listen, do you think and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?"
Those really were her panties?,"Cole has travelled through the forest of crustaceans and brought us a treasure, and he has earned his reward.",Ahhoy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
"If I could just get the immunity, I would...","No, Sophie, you can't. Use whatEver criteria you want.","If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity?"
"If he dEveloped DIC after the surgery, Even a normal biopsy bleeds out of control.","So cardiac arrest and DIC, what's the common denominator?",A brain damaged choochoo train?
"So the main mass is somewhere else, throws up a clot, blocks an artery in his heart, causes the arrest. House watches as 13's hand starts shaking as she tries to put the lid on a pen.",Good. Go find out where he's hiding his cancer.,"Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head."
It was creepy. The Patient predicted his own death.,"Would have been more impressive if he'd predicted that he wasn't going to die. Of course, that takes longer to prove.","Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so."
"Yeah, could be adrenal gland disorders, blood issues, anaphylaxis.","If you're going to kiss his ass to protect your ass, at least wait until he's had a good idea.","Well, I never call me."
"He got scared right after a transfusion. Tainted blood has been known to cause a sense of impending doom, could also explain the DIC.",I predict all your pagers go off... right now. Nothing happens. Oh! But if it had happened...,Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
That doesn't tell us anything specific about...,Are you acting stupid because you know you're safe? ClEver.,Where did you get that information.
He's bleeding way too much for Amyloidosis.,He say anything about his hands or feet feeling weak?,"No, no, no, stay there."
"He said his hands felt numb, but that's explained by the blood loss.",No! Do not give me credit for that. Close doesn't count! That's how people get sucked into this stupidity.,And all of the sudden his hands werent the problem anymore.
That's how people get sucked into this stupidity. He's seizing.,Somebody stabilise him.,Yeah. Hes ganged up.
You knew they'd get paged?,"I noticed a trend... If nobody does anything, sick people often get sicker. You think it's remotely possible they had sex?",So did they call you to tell you your names gonna be in this?
"They're both single, it's still legal in the blue states.",She barely knows him.,Theyre not a couple!
"You know, in some cultures, hiring people to steal someone's underpants is considered wooing. You should move there. Because here it's just, you know, creepy.",There was no woo. This was an effective test. House scores.,"Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division."
"Kidneys are shutting down. Led to a sodium deficiency, caused him to seize.",Kidney failure means I was right about Amyloidosis.,She wont talk so much when shes choking on my cock.
So kidney failure proves I'm right about the bad blood.,Bad blood doesn't explain the heart or the liver.,I often forget other people have limitations.
His major symptoms didn't start until after we transfused him.,Is cardiac arrest no longer considered a major symptom?,Well yeahyeah the Scottish history is so much more
Not when it's caused by drowning.,So your new theory is that you were an idiot to take this case.,Yknow that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yes. Can I go test that theory now?,Waste of time. He needs a bone marrow transplant for the Amyloidosis.,No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee lil bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
"You'd have to irradiate him first. If they're right about the blood, you'd be destroying his immune system for nothing. House stares at Wilson. Which could be a good thing, does he have a really crappy life?",Go prove I'm right. Do a subcutaneous fat biopsy.,Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?
Go prove I'm right. Do a subcutaneous fat biopsy.,You've got two hours.,I think you should drink the fat.
That's completely arbitrary.,"No, if I'd said that you got three lunar months, that'd be completely arbitrary.","What, like theres a rule or something?"
We've still got 32 minutes left.,"Time flies, what have you found?",37 minutes left until the deadline.
"You're checking up on them. That means Cole's finished with the biopsy, and it was negative.","Inconclusive. Fat doesn't always give you the answer. Need to biopsy his actual organs, lungs, kidneys, liver.","I, uh... I let her win."
"We stick another needle in him, he'll haemorrhage.",Unless we start treatment for Amyloidosis.,They said whats left of him could fit in a wine glass.
Unless we start treatment for Amyloidosis.,Show me evidence of infection.,Wont make us any younger.
Show me evidence of infection.,He'll be dead in a day.,Happy birthday sweetie.
Like he predicted.,No!,As I expected.
Starts to leave. No. Don't.,You're playing the Cuddy card?,"Oh, no. You have to go."
That's why I'm here.,Amyloidosis was your idea.,Thats why youre here.
I was wrong.,"Yeah, me too, you were nEver fun. Give me the blood. I'm type AB, give me the blood. Takes off his jacket.","Congratulations, my lady."
WhatEver's in there could be killing him.,In where? How much tainted blood do you think they keep in here? How Many people would have gotten sick...,"Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height."
In where? How much tainted blood do you think they keep in here? How Many people would have gotten sick...,"Rolls up his sleEve. Ok. So transfuse blood from those donors. I'll be fine, we move on, treat for Amyloidosis. Holds out his arms. Fill 'er up.","Well then, whats the one true rumor?"
"Rolls up his sleEve. Ok. So transfuse blood from those donors. I'll be fine, we move on, treat for Amyloidosis. Holds out his arms. Fill 'er up.",I have a new theory. You're not stubborn. You're not getting it checked 'cause you already know the answer. I found an old picture in your wallet.,"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?"
I have a new theory. You're not stubborn. You're not getting it checked 'cause you already know the answer. I found an old picture in your wallet.,"I wasn't snooping, I needed lunch money.",Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket.
"I wasn't snooping, I needed lunch money. Figure it's your mum, except she looks about 32 years old. The only reason not to update a photo in 20-odd years is she's not talking to you, which would be interesting, or she's dead. Which would also be interesting. 13 gives House a look. She's dead.",Pretty young to have a dead mum. You were Even younger 20 years ago. I googled her obituary. Said she died at Newhaven Presbyterian after a long illness. Parkinson's?,"That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops."
Pretty young to have a dead mum. You were Even younger 20 years ago. I googled her obituary. Said she died at Newhaven Presbyterian after a long illness. Parkinson's?,I'm sorry.,"Oh! Thats interesting, since she died seven years ago!!"
Parkinson's? I'm sorry.,No you're not.,"Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke."
No you're not.,Huntington's isn't the only thing that causes tremors.,"We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it."
Huntington's isn't the only thing that causes tremors.,I think you're the only one on the team who drinks decaf.,"Ooh, go easy with the shaking."
I think you're the only one on the team who drinks decaf. I've been switParkng it out with regular Ever since you dropped that file. You're trembling because you're hopped up on caffeine. The first file wasn't my fault. Medical explanation for that is... People drop things.,You are.,Its okay. She thinks she has decaf.
People drop things. You are.,"With Huntington's, it's inevitable.",Im not a dropper!
"With Huntington's, it's inevitable.","Surprised. How could you not get tested? If your mum had it, it's a 50% chance, you're a bomb waiting to explode.",She doesnt know Im living with a straight woman.
"Surprised. How could you not get tested? If your mum had it, it's a 50% chance, you're a bomb waiting to explode.","Yeah because if you knew, you couldn't do any of those things. 13 notices something. What?","Well, I cant say any of us were surprised."
Could be pneumococcus. That'd cause chest pain and the stiff neck.,It's not pneumococcus.,So make that error!
Let me check your lymph nodes. House slaps his hand away.,"I'm not the Patient. The Patient is the one whose body is shutting down, I'm having a benign transfusion reaction.","Arg... Alright, Ill take care of it. throws hands out in the air"
"Pseudomonas would present as an armpit rash, take off your shirt.",You first.,Better put it on the list.
"House, you got to let us do this. We can't biopsy him without bleeding him to death.",You are not biopsying me.,"See, now its weird again."
How's your stomach? Any diarrhoea?,"Sighs. The more transfusions you have, the greater the chance of you reacting, I've had three in a decade. FEver will be gone in a couple of hours.","Listen to him, Andy."
You told us to give you the blood so that you wouldn't...,I am not sick.,No. Do you?
FEver is a symptom.,"But not of what the Patient has! My kidneys are working, I'm not bleeding out of Every organ.","If you dont want what most men want, then youd better tell me what youd like me to do."
"My kidneys are working, I'm not bleeding out of Every organ. Yet.",This is a waste of time. And it's distracting you from the actual case. Gets up and starts to walk away but stops after a couple of steps.,"Oh, great. Great. Youre doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going."
This is a waste of time. And it's distracting you from the actual case. Gets up and starts to walk away but stops after a couple of steps.,The room is spinning.,Get out of the way.
The room is spinning. You okay?,"No, I'm dizzy, and my mouth just went dry.",Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Could be a symptom of any number of...,It's a symptom of narcotics. Looks at his cup of tea. Who spiked my... Collapses on the floor.,"Uh, she works in the annex."
I'm going to run some stains. 13 stares at Cole. He'll be less of an ass to you.,Patient dead yet?,Wed better take these pants off upstairs or that stains gonna set.
Patient dead yet?,Look at his hands and sees that he has been tied to the table. That's a little much for a first date.,"No, shes not okay?"
Look at his hands and sees that he has been tied to the table. That's a little much for a first date.,Feels like you already got the... lung and kidney samples.,"Howard, weve only been on three dates."
Feels like you already got the... lung and kidney samples.,"Hey, you might want to use a little bit of lidocaine...",Do you have any tissues?
"Hey, you might want to use a little bit of lidocaine...",You drugged me.,Glass of water would be a start.
Stopped by the lab. Your mutinous team is starting to worry about life on Pitcairn Island. All your biopsies are clean.,Because there's nothing wrong with me. Did Foreman finally okay the Amyloidosis treatment?,It looks like Im going nowhere.
Patient's scheduled for irradiation at nine. Sits down. You risked your life AGAIN. You couldn't be sure he had Amyloidosis.,You can't be sure that I couldn't be sure.,I wish youd never told me.
"You did one test, it was negative.",Inconclusive.,Its only one colour.
"Well then, by all means, flood your body with possibly lethal blood.","I usually like to give the lethal blood to Foreman, but I'm the only one who's type AB.","Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them."
"Of course, you're type AB. Universal recipient, you take from Everybody.","Of course, you're type O. Universal donor. No wonder you're paying three alimonies.","No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?"
How do you know... What blood type I am?,Shrugs. I don't. Just seemed to fit the metaphor.,What is your type?
"No, no, no, no, no. Did you test my blood for something? Why would you test my blood for something?",I didn't. You must have told me what you were.,Do you think its really Tyrion?
Who the hell chats about their blood type? You had to have tested me.,Epiphany. There's no reason to ask anyone their blood type.,"OK, Ill just sit here and."
"You're about to run out of here, aren't you?","Nurse, can I have a moment with my Patient?",Im done. I gotta get out of here.
He's due in radiation.,It's too late. He's dying.,Professor Proton is dead?
He's dying. Told you.,I'm sorry I doubted you.,You coward.
"Laughs. I'm taking it with me. See, that way, it stays magic.","You were wrong about Everything. It was nEver magic, and you're not dying. Finn is surprised. What's your blood type?",Ill wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
Type A. House smiles. What?,"Trust me, it's way cooler to know.","Its a, its a cat!"
"Trust me, it's way cooler to know. Where's Finn?","Up my sleEve. It's not Amyloidosis. And his blood's fine, we just gave him the wrong type. Caused the DIC, explains the bleeding, multisystem failures.","Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasnt come back yet. She doesnt know where he is."

The decreased function could be from dehydration caused by vomiting due to a gallstone.,You agreed that the chem 7 would decide if it was a struvite stone.,"If like the four of us could all yknow, hang out together."

Why am I doing!,Shut up and look. Cate does as she's told.,What are you doing here!
She could pass out. She needs...,She needs to re-inflate that lung.,"Um, no, no."
Means it's not a kidney stone.,"Right side pain, vomiting, and now a lung that gets traumatised without any trauma. Sounds odd, pRobably is odd.","Based on what happened next, I assume it means would you like an enema?"

Since when do you let Patients participate in differentials?,"Since the Patient and her doctor happen to be the same person. Your kidney function is still declining, means you have a kidney pRoblem.","Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, thats my room."

Good for you.,She's annoying. Refused to take the antibiotics because other people might need them.,"Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?"
She said she cares about other people? What a poser. KUB is clean. You don't like her because she's a psyParkatrist.,I'm a compliCated Man. I loathe her for Many reasons.,Yeah! You dont like Kathy.

"PRobably, but we can't confirm it without a biopsy.",You can't analyse a biopsy without a stain.,"Yes. Yes, its possible."
We can't biopsy.,Cause they don't have stains down there. We need a substitute.,But what if we cant?
She can't biopsy that node without a surgical team and an OR.,"Anything with a strong colour could work as a stain. Printer ink, food colouring, coffee.","Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellies pay a hundred dollars. Angela?"

The health department. They frown on topless oncology. You're going to do a physical?,Have to. You and Foreman are going to be here looking for a stain. House leaves.,"Plus, theres almost no chance well see any of our coworkers half naked."
I can do the physical. There's no reason you need to watch.,I can think of at least three reasons. One of them's medical.,"Fine, I dont want to watch with you either."

Fiction is a waste of time unless you can laugh at it.,I love to laugh. Moving on. Moves the laptop again showing a glimpse of the half bottle of bourbon on the coffee table.,"Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd."
Back up. House stops. How bad is the insomnia? Let me quantify that. Do you drink two or three scotches before passing out in front of the TV?,You are so far off. It's bourbon. Gives her a better look at the bottle. Then continues showing the apartment.,"Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because Im exhausted!"
No photos anywhere. Family and friends aren't important?,"Well, you're sick. You have 20 people down the hall and you've had exactly one visitor.","Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brothers new baby on it, so."

"Stop projecting. You're anti-social, so you assume I'm anti-social.",Rolls his eyes. How about if I just get naked and you shut up?,You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.

It's the South Pole. I wear a lot of layers. Okay. Ready. Picks up the camera.,I saw socks. That's not naked.,Its so cold.
"Have I mentioned it's freezing here? When they discover lymph nodes in feet, I will take off my socks.","Use your right hand to palpate the nodes. Any node you can feel is one we can biopsy.

I was thinking... go from the neck and work my way down.,"Well, you could. But I'd nEver forgive myself if we found something before we got to your breasts.","Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah."
"I'm starting with the anterior cervical nodes. Starts to feel her neck, House sits up and puts down the drink.",Turn your head. LoCate the SCM muscle.,"Heres a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red."

"No swelling, no tenderness, and I can hear that, House.",Just thought it might help you relax. Anything in the axillary nodes?,"Mmhmm. Yes, Im fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said its still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it."
All clear. Both sides.,"Slide your hand to your sternum, pRobe for nodes. Moving slowly downward. Cate does as told.",Hes right. Were all on the same side.
"Down to what, House?","Sorry, can't hear you on account of your heavy breathing.",You gonna buy another round for the house?
"I'm supposed to be on oxygen, you tool.",Turns off the music. Hold it. Cate stops. Your fingers didn't go quite as deep. Feel that node again.,You know what does have an oh in front of it?
Feel that node again. It!it's swollen.,Looks like you're doing a biopsy.,Did I squeeze it too hard?
"Okay, take a deep breath... and insert the needle into the node.","Come on, Cate. Let's get this over with.","Uh, put your elbow in it."
Mutes the microphone.You used her name.,"Just trying to move things along, Bob. Wilson un-mutes.","OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
You need to pull back on the syringe. Cate tries to pull but nothing happens. You need to pull harder. Cate does so and screams in pain as the syringe fills with some sort of yellow liquid.,You okay?,The Queen cant kill me.
Are you okay?,It's a valid medical question.,"Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, Im dating you."
"I have nEver heard you ask a Patient that question. You've nEver asked me that question, and you've seen me fall down a flight of stairs drunk. You've slept with her.","She's 9,000 miles away. Elevator opens, they walk out towards the exit. And while a certain part of me unfurled!",I left this shit city because I didnt want to die in it.
"No, you! Somehow you've been intimate with her. Why are you following me?",Thought you were following me.,Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
"No, you are definitely following me.",Where are you going?,"Oh, God. I think someones following us."
Out to lunch.,You nEver go out to lunch. Means there's a reason you're going out to lunch. I assume that reason is a huMan being.,I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to.

Are you going to follow me into my car?,It's got two doors.,"Wait, Im leaving my car here?"
"Call off your dogs, House. Your little helpers are interrogating my Patients, swiping my charts, intercepting prescriptions.",Why would you think that I'm!,Mine stole my newspaper!
Because I'm not a moron. You had to be pulling the strings here. You think that because they make me miserable I'm going to give you cable?,Let's assume that's true. And it certainly sounds like it might be. What are you going to do?,"Okay. If you cant get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your WiFi?"
Nothing. I resigned from the budget committee. Shows House a piece of paper. I only joined the committee to help the hospital. You made me a liability. I now have zero influence over the hospital's cable policy. Walks away and smiles.,Well done.,Nothing! Its over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
It didn't work. There's nothing more that we can do.,Put these up. Hands them some fliers.,I didnt know what else to do.

Is there good news? You're back at home.,Of course. There's cable. And the freedom to work pant-free.,Its good to be home.
That is good news.,Wilson found signs of inflammation in your biopsy.,"Thats good to hear, cause Ive got some news."
"Autoimmune is just your latest theory. Like cancer before that, and a kidney stone before.","Take the prednisone, you'll get better, that'll be your confirmation.","So, as Joeys friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?"
"You practice medicine like it's a fire sale. You've wasted antibiotics, X-rays.",That was not a waste. We ruled out!,"No, its an invitation."
"We have a crew member here who has asthma. If he has an episode after I've used up the prednisone, he'll die.","There a good chance he's going to die anyway, since there won't be a doctor there to help him.","Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma?"
We should send her outside.,"Right, just tell her to head north until she runs into a hospital.","Ok, you know what, Im just gonna take her outside."
Notices something on House's desk. Is that my wallet?,"Yeah, you can have it back. I've already been through it. I like your ice on a sprain metaphor. Makes it seem like we're not killing her.","Okay, okay, okay, look, just dont freak out, but I kinda lost it."
She'd only need to be outside five minutes.,Without her mittens. Mom told me that was a bad idea. Especially that winter it was 70 below and I had dual kidney failure.,"Yeah, shes been out there for twenty minutes, Im surprised you didnt hear her on the way over."

"There are no ideas. The test for autoimmune is ANA. Unless penguins poop immuno-analysers, she's not!","Before A.N.A. testing, people had autoimmune diseases. How did they know?","You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins."
How did they know? C3.,Before that.,They didnt know?
You don't need them. Holds up a paperclip.,"When you shake the test tube, the paperclip will damage some of your blood cells.",You have a thing of paper clips right there.
No change. So how long should I give the cells to fatten up before I check them?,Couple hours. Or you could stop being a hypocrite and take the prednisone now.,Exactly. Are you sure youre doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.
Not bending to your will makes me a hypocrite?,"If your psych Patients deManded lab results, you'd nEver make a diagnosis.",I only do what my Lord commands!
"So I'm wrong. You sleep like a baby, your life is unfolding as you dreamed.",Everyone is miserable. You don't change that because people don't change.,"And when you recount your day, never say you woke up."
You want to beliEve that because then you're freed from any responsibility for your misery.,Oh shut up. I get enough of this from Wilson.,Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.
"And yet you keep hanging out with him. And from what I hear, you have spent more time with me than with any other Patient.",Sorry about that. Call me when you get the results. Turns off the camera.,Because he has your blood in his veins.
How's your Patient?,She has an autoimmune disease. Tell the psych department she's in denial.,"Hey, hows life with your baby?"
"Taub caught the error in time. If she'd just admitted the mistake, maybe I could've just suspended her. But... she's packing up, if you want to say good-bye.",We should be hearing from the South Pole in a few minutes.,"All right! Lets get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, were probably gonna have to clean this up! Yknow? Were gonna have to reschedule!"
We should be hearing from the South Pole in a few minutes. That's it?,Well there's nothing to be done. She screwed up. She's got no one to blame but herself. Cuddy leaves.,"Yeah, well keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole."
I got to go talk to Cameron.,"Cuddy wouldn't can her for one screw-up and if she did, she wouldn't come to me.",And I really really need to talk to David.
Why would she lie?,Timeless question.,Shes lying because she doesnt want you to know were dating.
LE Prep test was negative. It's not autoimmune.,You're basing that on a test done with a paperclip. Just take the prednisone.,"Wait a minute, his name is Dr."
Either find another diagnosis or find another test.,There is one way. You can take this experimental drug called... pred-ni-sone! Your Kidneys start working...,"A Dry Cleaners, Joey is there with Phoebe and is trying to get his picture put back amongst the other celebrities hanging on the walls."
There is another test.,"Scrunches his Parkp packet near the microphone. I, I think Foreman may have just broken up there. What he actually said was there is no other test.",Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
"If I go outside, we'll have our answer? Foreman nods. To House. And you knew about this?","I rejected it because if you're frozen solid, it's hard to get the needles into your arms.","Hey, Im going to go outside and talk to Dwight."
At least five minutes.,Eight minutes outside would kill a healthy person. And healthy people don't suck on oxygen masks. Healthy people can pee.,He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
"I'll go get Sean, have him come with me. Starts taking off layers.",Just take the prednisone!,"Well go. Im still recovering. So lets just, Ryan, could you get my coat please."
Are you all right? She collapses.,Oh I'm sure she's just fine. Cate? To Foreman Do you know if there's anyone down there who has a cell phone.,"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work."
"Took the station mechanic 20 minutes to respond. She'd already slipped into a coma. Started her on prednisone, but no improvement.","Means it's not autoimmune. Good thing she's in a coma, or we'd have to listen to her gloat.",Mmmhmm. Why dont you start by telling me what you got.
And where are we going?,To find the useful members of my team.,Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
You're letting them off the hook?,"Happy? Because of you, I'm not going to be able to watch law and order in Korean.",Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didnt tell them.
Why am I here?,Because I want to ask you about your girlfriend. I must know who she is or you'd have told me her name.,"Well, you know, theres no one way really, its just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, Im over you."
She doesn't have a name. It's some sort of birth defect.,"There's only about 12 people we both know. I can't remember five of their names, so we're down to... Cuddy! Your ex-wives...","Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name."
"Your mama. Elevator opens, they walk out. You need to run a kidney function test.","Yes, if only she wasn't in a coma, we could get her to run a test to find out why she's in a coma.","Ooh, boy. You should warn people theres no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch."
We could talk the mechanic through the test.,Too compliCated... Unless he's thirsty.,"Sure, you know what?"
And then you can fix it?,Let's say yeah.,So you know how to fix it?
Take a straight catheter and insert it...,"These are your only questions? Not, is it safe? Or, is there another way? Or, are you out of your minds?","It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt."
You wouldn't ask me if!,Wait a second.,"Just so I know, if I had asked first."
Why do you care how I feel about her?,"Because now, I know that I can get you to do anything to save her. Tell him how to tap the keg. Leaves.",Im sorry. I justwhen I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
"Because now, I know that I can get you to do anything to save her. Tell him how to tap the keg. Leaves.",You got Cameron fired.,"Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?"
Cuddy wasn't supposed to find out.,No kidding! Get me cable. How tough can that be? Cost a Woman her job. There's only one thing you can say to keep me from firing you.,This is the bite of a fly.
No kidding! Get me cable. How tough can that be? Cost a Woman her job. There's only one thing you can say to keep me from firing you.,Wrong.,Cable out! Let her go!
We're still fired?,That should be a hint as to what you're supposed to say.,"Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. So you had a bad day"
That should be a hint as to what you're supposed to say. We're sorry.,Wrong.,We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
I love you.,Wrong.,Im suddenly feeling flushed.
I love you. Wrong.,Right.,"Wrong, and lets keep it clean, shall we?"
Starts to leave. No!,"I didn't mean on this. Seriously, I need cable.","No, III gotta go."
"I didn't mean on this. Seriously, I need cable.","Milk, milk, lemonade?",Does my room have cable?
This tastes kind of watery.,That's bad news.,I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.
How do you figure out which one it is?,"We don't do anything. You're going to drill a hole in her skull. If she regains consciousness, it's increased intracranial pressure.","You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!"
And if it's the other thing?,"She'll die. But if it's the hypothalamus, she's dead anyway.","No, no, uh, its not what you think."
"If the pRoblem is the pressure in her brain, and I fix it, is she going to be all better?","Nope, but it'll give us more time to figure out what's wrong.",Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last nights chutney?
Starts to panic. I have to get someone else. I can't do this.,"You love her, right? You'd do anything to save her.",I dont know what my next move is.
"Not this. I can't do this. If, if she dies because of something that I did, then I!","Listen, listen. I am not going to let you hurt her. Okay? Now please... This is her only chance.","If she can do it, I can do it."
Okay. Gets up and walks towards Cate.,"Well, that was easy.",Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
"Bone's harder than wood, lean into it. The skull's only a quarter-inch thick. Once you're midway through, drill in shorter bursts. Sean does as he's told.","If it comes out the other side, you've gone too far.",What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
"The drill gets through the bone and Sean stops it. Okay, now what? Now what?",Let the fluid drain. Blood starts to come out of the hole in Cate's head. After a few seconds Cate starts to wake up.,l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead.
Sean? What's going on?,"South Pole doc is out of her coma, and now we have a new symptom. Increased intracranial pressure.",Scott! What in the hell is going on here?
Why are we out here?,That's the Patient room. ICP plus kidney pRoblems plus lung collapse equals?,We should really learn how to play the real way.
We ruled out cancer.,But not clots. What causes blood clots?,"Well, we determined the cause of the fire."
Deep vein thrombosis plus an existing PFO.,PFO would've been discovered in her pre-South Pole physical exam.,"My god, Im so sorry."
"What if the clots aren't clots? Atherosclerosis. Fatty plaque builds up on the arterial walls, pieces break off, block blood flow. Explains Everything.","She has zero risk factors. Forget fat, think clots.",I prefer to stand.
"Forget fat, think clots. No.",You're standing up to me?,Youve got fat.
You're standing up to me? Maybe.,Just to clarify. You should do that when you're right. Sorry for the confusion. How could a clot!,"Yknow you dont have to stand here with me, believe me"
"Could be a different kind of fat, fat emboli.",That's a perfect fit...,Glass of fat?
"That's a perfect fit... Except it's completely impossible! Fat emboli requires an unrepaired bone break. Between the x-ray and the exam, I've seen her entire! Epiphany. See, that's what I'm talking about. Kutner bows.",Take off her socks. Sean moves to her feet.,"Oh, I cant believe you called her fat."
"No, I got it. Takes off her sock rEvealing quite a badly broken big toe.",Your toe is broken.,Oh I got it!
"Oh, my god.","Bits of bone marrow have been leaking into your blood stream. Those fat emboli have caused blockages in your kidney, lungs, and brain.",Are you willing to risk it?
It doesn't Even hurt.,Cold numbs Everything. Does a particularly great job on the extremities.,"It didnt hurt, did it?"
You'll need to close the break to stop the marrow from leaking.,This one you will feel.,Youll break it.
To Sean Will you do it?,He drilled a hole in your skull after drinking your pee. I think he's up for this.,Hey Jim. Stanleys back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
"Grab the tip of her toe with your right hand. Hold the break with the other. Sean does as he's told. On the count of three, pull hard. One... two... three. Sean pulls, we hear a loud crack and Cate screams.",Now splint your toe. You'll be fine.,"I cant. Shes too strong. Shes, careful, though. You dont want to break it."
"Thank you, House.",Don't thank me.,"Thanks, thanks Dana."
To waiter. A bottle of the Bordeaux and some sParkling water.,"Well, you didn't pick her up. Which means she's coming from work too. Which means you're comfortable enough to meet her.","My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isnt this romantic?"
Damn. Thought I lost you when I walked backwards through my own footprints in the snow.,I think I've got it narrowed down to three possibilities.,"Well, wewe had to go back because I forget my jacket."
"Better leave, if you see her, it'll be cheating.",It's not one of your ex-wives.,Youd better let her loose.
Because they hate me.,"They don't. They should, but they don't. I called them. Someone new, but someone I know.","Well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you."
Did you Ever consider being happy for me?,Briefly. You ordering the wine before she got here!,You want me to be happy?
"Girls are good, House. And you know it. You solved your case because you cared about that girl.",You're demonstrating the illusion of Manly confidence. Which means you haven't closed the deal yet.,Im sorry. Im sorry. II should probably leave you girls alone.
I closed the deal. I just like her.,Still?,"I appreciate the offer, but if things dont work out with you two, Im swooping in on her like a vulture."
"You knew your Patient hated having cold feet because you did a physical exam, because you liked her.","Your theory is I cared, therefore I let her keep her socks on? If that's what love is, then I don't want to have anything to do with it.","Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, handshaking, hugging, prostate exams."
It starts with warm feet but leads to other things. Your mom and I will explain when you're older.,"If I'd made her take them off like I should've, I would've seen the toe and would've solved the case days ago.","Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot."

Cryoglobulinemia might account for the symptoms.,Except for the one you missed.,Youre being put into carbon freeze.

"Look, she's nuts, but we can't just give her ten ccs of atheism and send her home.","Religion is a symptom of irrational belief and groundless hope.

We should X-ray for malformations of the rib that could cause arterial twisting.,Malformations don't cause bloody urine.,Did somebody say baby back ribs?
It's who he might be. She's connecting with all the years she's not gonna have.,Better way of connecting to those years is to actually have them.,"Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now shes celebrating that by going on a date with him."
"Joshua got God to make the sun stand still. No reason God can't speed it up. And, by God, I, of course, mean you.",Told you we needed you.,"Its not God, Summer."
You wanted to see me?,And you came.,You saw me?
I feel pretty confident it'll be something interesting.,looking at the 'board Solve this case and the job is yours.,"Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, itll be a surprise."

pointing at House Then you've changed.,"If you do change, can it be the part of you that Chases me down halls, trying to change me?","Look, I get that you grew up here and youre attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too."
flabbergasted Do you know what this means?,That you made one good dating choice. The fabric of the space/time continuum could unravel.,Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
And yet you're going along with it. shivers a bit Are you being... self-sacrificing?,I'll sacrifice... a lab rat. I'll sacrifice a fly. I'll sacrifice two hundred on a mudder at Monmouth Park. I don't sacrifice self.,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasnt exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
I'll sacrifice... a lab rat. I'll sacrifice a fly. I'll sacrifice two hundred on a mudder at Monmouth Park. I don't sacrifice self.,"Shabbat Shalom, Wilson.",Ive sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
"You okay? Screen goes white and we hear Jeff fall to the ground. Oh, my god, Jeff!",The place is a mess.,"Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We shouldve told you about the broken elevator."
"Welcome to a world without nurses. Hands House some files. Here, you can start with these.","Doesn't take them. It's not my fault, I don't use nurses.","Well, whose fault is that?"
"Cuddy was looking for you, said she'd send you down here.","I know, that's why I'm here. Goes and sits down.","Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady."
Because Cuddy hasn't found you yet. Shakes her head and goes to look after a Patient.,She's going to look Everywhere except the place she wants me to be.,"Well, Im her son, how come she doesnt send someone to check on me if Im lonely?"
I've got an aortic dissection here.,What's with the idiot?,"Ugh, this again."
Ah.. Picks up his file. Fainting spell and recent history of dysgeusia. Everything tastes like lemon meringue pie. You want to take him?,No. Cameron makes an 'of course' gesture and goes back to what she was doing. To Jeff. Sir. Why do you have two lunches in front of you?,"Mmm. Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes.

Been here for two meals.,And you're happy with that?,Im been here about.
"Shrugs. No, I just don't see much use in complaining.","Seriously? It's a very useful tool. Gets up and walks over to him. Complain, you make people miserable. They do what you want to make the misery go away.","Well if I were complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying."
Still smiling. I'm sure it was an accident.,To Cameron. Is he Canadian?,Another happy accident.
"Uh, he's a low priority...",Is that a yes?,"Well, is that really a priority?"
Is that a yes? He's just...,Happy.,Does he have to be?
"Happy. Jeff smiles. I've got to stop this before it spreads. House whistles. Taub, Kutner, Thirteen and Cameron all look towards House. You guys are done. Taub, Kutner and Thirteen start walking over, Cameron looks annoyed.","Could be a metabolic disorder, toxic exposure, carcinoma of the tongue metastasized to the brain, Epilepsy, MS!","Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know youre all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. So, take it away."
"Sarcastically No, you're ignoring the big symptom. To House. What if we're looking at both the flu and decent parenting?","Okay, you two are perfectly healthy. This guy wasn't pandering, he wasn't vanilla nice, he was nice without any aspiration for personal gain. I'm thinking genetic defect.","I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
Laughs. Niceness is a defect?,"Three cavemen, see a stranger running towards them with a spear.","Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness."
And how long has the Patient been... suffering?,"At least as long as his wife has known him, 11 years.","Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet Ive had since I was twelve."
The chances of him having an undiagnosed pathology for that long...,"What are you saying? That evolution is wrong? Scoffs. Where do you think we are, 21st Century America?",How long do you think a week is?
"You want it to be a symptom because then we're supposed to be jerks, which means you don't Even have to try to be nice.","Okay, maybe I'm biased, let's take a vote.","If we act nice now, then were rewarding them for treating us poorly."
Taub and Thirty-One... Thirty-One?,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that either way was good with you.",I was ahead of the car.
"Too much axis tilt. House turns back to look at him. Don't release until your thumb's at the bottom of the ball. Chase gets ready to bowl, he has a glove on one hand. I assume Wilson was busy.",Again.,Just throw the ball.
Bowls a strike. Turns around and smiles at House. No axis tilt. House pops a pill. With Amber?,Again. Washes the pill down with some beer.,The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room.
"Still, it was nice of you to invite me, this is fun.","No, it wasn't. No, it isn't. I didn't invite you to be nice, I invited you because bowling isn't one of the two things guys do by themselves.",I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
What's the second thing?,Other hand. Bowls a gutter ball.,What is the thing?
"Well if people are incapable of being nice, why bother having the word?","Ah, the ontological proof of niceness. The existence of the word proves the existence of the concept. Look out for those minotaurs on your drive home.","Thank you, but how do I know youre not saying that just to be nice?"
"I thought motives didn't matter, only results mattered. So what are you going to do to screw up Wilson's relationship so you don't have to listen to me while you bowl?","I wish the best for them and their tragically deformed Parkldren. Bowls his second shot but we don't see the result, House doesn't look too pleased though","Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, whatshisname and the big blue chick in Avatar. Im gonna bowl now."
"Well, she's good... At being bad. You might not be able to destroy her.","Well as long as I give it my best shot, I can hold my head high.","Cut off her head, before she casts a spell on you."
"Cameron had this one insufferable friend. She wasn't going to get rid of her and I sure wasn't going to join them, so I just said, see her on Thursday's. I know it's not as exciting as an exploding birthday cake, but, hell, I don't want to hang out with her Every night anyway.",That's amazing. Cameron only has one insufferable friend? Chase bowls another strike. Turns around and House is gone.,"Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around!"
That's amazing. Cameron only has one insufferable friend? Chase bowls another strike. Turns around and House is gone.,Joint custody.,"Monica and Rachels, Joey enters, upset."
Joint custody. Of Wilson?,Unless we have another love Parkld?,"Yeah, well mymy exwife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as Im sure you are with your wife!"
Looks at Wilson Deal with him.,"He needs a mother figure. I'm not saying you're not entitled to spend time with him, I'm just saying I'm entitled too. Amber looks at Wilson again.","Thats enough. Sams no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so hes come here. Were not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. Hes our brother now and were going to protect him."
"No, crazy is what House would normally do in this situation... Swap your lubricant with superglue.",The Man knows me.,"Id suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well."
This is his way of accepting us.,It's actually a very touParkng moment. I'm proposing I get Every other day and Every other weekend.,"Hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!"
"I have yoga Wednesday's, you can have him then. But you have to have him home by 11. House looks at Wilson who doesn't look up from his paper. We can swap weekends.","Mondays and Wednesdays, and midnight.",And hes always at the yoga studio.
"If he's not home till midnight, we won't be asleep till almost 200.",Wilson? Make a ruling.,"Im telling you, somethings wrong!"
"Laughs. Uh no. You two are like dogs circling each other in the Park. Looks at Amber. And I say that with all the love in the world. You need to sniff each other's butts, bare your teeth, and arrive at some strange detente. Otherwise, you'll end up biting each other's eyes out. Again, with all the love in the world.",I'll let you sniff first.,"Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldnt be together, yknow."
"Take my deal, or get out of my apartment.","Take my deal, or I move in. Sits down.",Let us keep the apartment and
Wouldn't that be nice?,"To Cuddy. You are King Solomon. If you want us to cut him in half, we're cool with that.","Oh, Howard, I cant believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey."
You are overtly contemptuous of hospital hierarchy.,And covertly. Cuddy looks at him. But I suppose you didn't know about that.,"Oh, I didnt know you wanted her too!"
"Your attitude towards supervisory personnel is disrespectful, and a disturbingly large proportion of your comments are racist or sexist.",That top makes you look like an Afghani prostitute... Would be an example of that.,"I, for starters, I think that you should resign."
"Comes barging in. House, I got the...","It can wait. To Cuddy, I will sign, if you will give us a ruling.",The apartment. There is a knock on the door.
"I will give you a ruling, if you do the reviews on your team. Kutner shuts the door behind him and takes one of Wilson's Parkps.",I'd be happy to continue the mockery of this process. Sign's the review.,Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.
To House. Wednesday's till 1100 and alternate weekends.,Yes. Wednesday nights are ladies' nights at Cheetah's.,"FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule."
Wednesday nights are ladies' nights at Cheetah's. Calcium's normal.,Wow. It really could wait.,"According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconis pizza night."
It really could wait. Everything's normal.,And you thought it wouldn't be.,Well it can wait.
"He's a carpet cleaner, he's got a home full of hydrofluoric acid.",Doesn't mean his calcium should be low.,All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.
"Yeah, actually it kinda does, HF causes lower lEvels of...","LowER, not low.","No. Wait, wait, does it?"
Lower than normal.,"Lower than yesterday. Yesterday might have been high, what's lower than high?",Its high but its not that high.
"He actually has hypercalcemia, which is being lowered to normal by the HF.","So what gives us elevated calcium, bad taste, and fainting?","Well, at least you make each other laugh."
I take it you know?,Get the team. This is going to be fun. House walks off.,"Alright. Oh, I assume Im going to be reimbursed for the pizzas."
Get the team. This is going to be fun. House walks off.,"Hello, again. These people think you are not too nice.","Ok, so now that youre in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
Too nice? For what?,For life as we know it to have evolved without an intelligent designer. I'm going to prove them wrong. Your wife... is very ugly.,"Nice? They were nice. I mean, thats it? I mean, mittens are nice."
Deb. He's obviously trying to prove a point.,I think I just did. You're either perfect or you're sick. In my experience sick is much more common.,"What d? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?"
"He's not sick, he's nice.",Nice in the sense that your toaster is nice for making you breakfast.,"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life."
"You're wrong, he's!","Relax, there's no cure. He's going to go right on tasting lemon meringue pie, fainting, and being a sap.","Hey! I want to say something. Ive been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldnt even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didnt any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. Its like sometimes some of you act like I dont even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now were not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldnt have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didnt care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now youre with someone else. And thats... fine. Its... whatever. Thats not what... Im not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that Im just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. Its a good day."
What about the other symptoms?,He has no other symptoms.,Do you think they have yesterdays daily news?
But William's does.,"He's got the teeth, glasses.","Well actually, Ross doesnt."
William's cuts IQ by 20...,He doesn't work in the physics department. Except when they spill a black hole on their carpet.,What do you think their combined IQ is?
Except when they spill a black hole on their carpet. Elfin appearance?,"Yeah, he's more legolas than Keebler, but I bet you he can still crack off a batch of Pecan Sandies.","Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonards apartment, I wouldnt wind up sitting on the floor all the time."
"Yeah, he's more legolas than Keebler, but I bet you he can still crack off a batch of Pecan Sandies. Perfect pitch?","To Jeff. You love to karaoke, right?","Pitch, my lord."
Laughs. I suck.,"Modest, another symptom...",Okay. I suck!
"No, he really does suck.",Give us a warble. You know any Cher?,"Nah, hes an ass."
"He's stroking. Taub, Kutner, and Thirteen all rush over, put the bed down, flashlight in the eyes, the usual medical stuff.",Not a moment too soon.,"Another Hospital Room, Chandler and Monica enter and start making out."
You were wrong.,"Why do people say that with such pleasure? It's very hurtful, you know?","Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation."
It means the Patient gets to keep being nice. Why does that offend you?,"It's the way he said it. He wasn't reliEved, he was excited. Very happily. He was also wrong, and I say that with no sense of pleasure.","Basically, we think youre a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you."
"Patient tested negative for William's, which means the stroke and Everything else wasn't caused by...",You.,"All right, lets think about this."
What the hell was that?,"I have to give each of you perforMance reviews. Kutner looks at the paper, still a little shocked. Plenty of other conditions can cause Debilitating niceness.","Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would."
How is that supposed to help him?,"I don't know. How's it supposed to help Wilson? To Kutner. Cross out Wilson's name and the date, and then fill in your own...","Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?"
The point of a review is to give feedback to help...,I'm thinking neurosyphilis. Wouldn't show up on the MRI without contrast. Looks at Kutner.,I want to talk to you about your review.
"He doesn't think it's syphilis, but he's going to go run those tests anyway.",Because he doesn't know. That's why we do tests.,"Oh, hes just trying to butter you up."
"Because he's a wimp, because he's afraid of you.",You want me to intimidate him into not being afraid? Not sure I know how to do that.,Maybe were not ready to hang out as friends.
"Reviews make a difference. People have to listen, so they have to learn.",I don't think that the right time to tell the dog not to pee on the rug is semi-annually.,"Is this how youve been conducting all the reviews, Michael?"
You don't want to do the paperwork.,I am concerned about the rainforest.,Dont sign anything.
Sighs. I'll do it.,I know. Walks to his office.,Im going to do it.
"Laughs. I'm not perfect. But she loves me, and she's always loved me. Every minute, Every day.",Gets up to open the door. You're 15 minutes late! House opens the door and its some Guy in a suit standing there.,I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.
Have you heard the good news?,Looks confused. Miley Cyrus is playing a third night at the spectrum?,So did you hear the news?
"Holds up a book. Happiness is possible. Amber and Wilson arrive. And not just in this life, but in the next...","Oh, you're selling religion. I'm sorry, I bought some Islam yesterday. Lets Amber and Wilson in.","All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and youre looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I dont know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be."
"Well, it's where your light shows signs before mending... House shuts the door in his face. Have a good Evening.",You're late.,But the light indicates
You're late. 15 minutes.,"16 minutes, MY 16 minutes.",I might be late.
So keep him an extra 16 minutes.,To Wilson. You hear that? She doesn't care.,A few more minutes is a waste of our time.
"You're going mini golfing, what's it matter? You got a tee off time?",It matters because you don't get to decide what matters.,"Again, it was miniature golf."
Which was my fault.,Rolls his eyes. I had to take a dump. Anything else I don't need to know before you leave? Opens the door.,"You see, the danger was that I might under or overreciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan."
"Kisses Wilson good bye. Have fun on your play date. As she's leaving. You've got mummy's numbers, right?","Shuts the door and looks at Wilson. Daddy needs a drink. Walks off to get one, Wilson laughs.","Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?"
"Slurring somewhat. Are you trying to get me drunk? House smiles, Wilson laughs. What time is it?",1030.,Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Ooh... She'll kill you.,I'll get you home before lights out. Pushes the drink closer to Wilson who takes it.,"Ohh! Okay, Im going to have to kick her ass too."
"Great, then she'll kill me. If I get, if I get any more drunk, then I'm... It... Might not work. If you, uh, know what I mean.",Really? You'd think that one or more of your ex wives would have mentioned that to me.,"Oh, no, no, no, well now, theres always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening."
"Shocked. They told you? Wait, why do you want to get Amber angry?",Because I'm your friend.,"Well, if I had told you, then it wouldnt have been surprise, now would it?"
"No, no, no. You said you approved, you said you were taking the high road. For how long, the first exit? House's phone rings.","Answers. Hello, and thank you for saving me from being righteoused to death. Gets up and walks away from Wilson.",Sold. I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place. There. Its done.
Hematemesis could indiCate...,Don't put it on the board. Taub stops writing.,"Pennys busy with my mother, so Im in."
You don't think it's a symptom?,"I think it's my marker. Taub rubs what he had written off the board. He has syph, and what?","Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, youll know why."
"And syph, it can cause hematemesis.",Not Everyone agrees.,"Shes right, as long as youre vomiting, coitus is contraindicated."
Looks surprised. How... How could you...,"If you all thought it was syph, you wouldn't have woken me up in the middle of the night.","Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there."
"The bleeding's pRobably from liver damage, pRobably caused by ethanol in the cleansers or the penicillin.",Two more pRobablys than I like to hear.,I think youre high on paint fumes.
Liver tests and serologies are going to take a full day.,"Full night, actually.",I dont believe this.
Could it be any worse on her than loving somebody who can't love them back?,Looks at them. Yes?,Youre making it difficult to love you right now.
You might want to turn off the TV.,I'm multi-tasking. Also doing my taxes. And Cuddy. What'd you find out?,I want to go to bed but I cant.
"The Patient has hepatitis. Kutner, Thirteen and Foreman stare at him.",I assume from your omission of the word 'viral' before the hep that it's not another STD.,"The Medical Research office, Joey is there with Carl in the waiting room."
To Taub. We're all doing this.,There's more?,Not about taking credit.
You have syphilis. House looks surprised.,"Turns off the TV and turns to face them. No, I don't.","Umm, youve got some on your pants."
One of us found a vial of your blood in the lab...,Which one of you?,"Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, oror was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Yknow who Im talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers"
"You did, didn't you?",There's something I need to tell you.,"Oh, you did, didnt you?"
You returned him drunk. House turns around startled and sees Amber sitting on a chair behind him.,On time.,The apartment. Leonard enters. There is a strange man sitting on the sofa.
On time. Drunk.,On time. No tag backs.,"Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause."
The purpose of the time was to give me time.,So you didn't have sex?,Whatd you do that for?
I like sex.,Well you can have it tonight. The L Word is on.,"Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great."
"You don't get to decide what matters. Either you're genuinely afraid I'm going to make him miserable, or you're afraid I'm going to make him happy, or you simply can't stop screwing with anything that moves. It doesn't really matter, because whatEver the reason, you'll only get worse. Until either I stop seeing Wilson, or I stop you. Stands up. What do you think I'm going to choose?","If you terminate the agreement, it's not going to bring peace in the mideast.","Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?"
I'm not terminating the agreement. I'm amending the agreement. I'm adding penalty clauses.,Fine. WhoEver violates it gets their finger cut off.,"That wasnt a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now."
WhoEver violates it gets their finger cut off. I'm serious.,"So am I. You want people to drive safer, take out the airbags and attach a machete pointing at their neck. No one will drive over three miles per hour.","Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriends hand at the movies."
I'm not cutting...,We'll figure it out.,"Cut, cut! What are you doing!?"
Where is she wrong? House hangs he's head. What were you going to tell me?,Nothing.,"Oh my God, youre right!"
You're punishing me?,I needed to tell you something... privately.,Are you going to punish him?
I'm not going to tell her.,"You'll tell her. She's your girlfriend, you should tell her.","Well, why dont you tell her?"
You're my friend.,It's not the same. Opens the door and starts to leave.,Youre such a great friend.
Opens the door and starts to leave. Don't sulk.,Where am I wrong? Shuts the door behind himself.,You leave the room and let the grownups talk.
"Your Management style is counterproductive. You gave me authority over the team, just so they could undercut...",Critiquing the clap addled? That's sort of tasteless.,"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
I didn't feel like waiting until your genitals cleared up. You need to formalise my authority over the team.,"No, I don't.","So, guys. Ive been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office were better than that. Ok, now Im going to show you a picture of genitalia."
You don't think I'm qualified?,Compared to those three?,"Oh no, Im fully qualified to"
You want to punish Cuddy for hiring me without...,I like Cuddy. I like parts of her.,I am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.
You want to crush the team by crushing me?,I want to empower them.,"What, are you crazy?"
Mocking me saves lives?,The hospital will pRobably build you a statue one day.,"Nope, I think mocking you is more fun."
Or you made up that BS because you like humiliating me.,Wouldn't rule that out completely.,This is ridiculous.
Wouldn't rule that out completely. You busy?,"Almost done. To Foreman. Uh, so just remember, the rabbit goes around the tree and jumps down the hole. Ties his shoelaces up.",You lost this.
Negative for sarcoidosis.,"Run him for Everything you can think of. Lepto, sParksto, hemo, and the fourth Marx brother nobody Ever heard of.",That is unbelievable.
She saved his life.,Or she scabbed.,Who helped him?
"Starts writing on the board. We, uh, loaded him full of prednisone to try to fix the liver.","Good news is, he's running out of organs to fail.","Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe."
Roid rage after six hours?,"At that rate, by sundown, he'll have eaten most of us.",You poor things you must be exhausted.
"It's not frying his liver, it's frying his syphilis. The penicillin's working, the real Patient is emerging.",So... syphilis prEvents domestic violence. I'm going to be Even more attractive to the ladies.,"Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately."
I was going to test for a heart issue before the syphilis. PFO could explain the heart attack and reduced blood flow to the brain could explain the rage.,"Well, they're all good ideas.","I I do, I do not love Rachel."
Suspicious. WhatEver I decide? House nods. You're setting me up.,Laughs. Why would I do that?,"Amy, this is crazy."
Why would I do that? Shrugs. PFO.,The PFO's have it.,I was happy to send Michael on this trip.
"You had no choice, you had to treat him. What's done is done. Leaves.","You know that thing I was going to tell you, I've got to tell you. I've got to tell someone. You have to swear not to tell CB.",Hes really picky about his patients.
You have to swear not to tell CB. Shrugs. WhatEver.,"Well, that's not swearing, that's shrugging. It's actually the opposite of swearing.",Really? You promise you wont tell anyone?
I won't tell Amber.,My team thinks that I have syphilis.,I wont tell anyone.
Surprised. Do you?,Not yet.,Im not surprised.
Why do they think you do?,"Because I knew that they had access to an old blood sample, and I knew they'd test it sometime for something.",Do they know they dont stand a chance cause youre so great?
Why would you swap your blood? What are you afraid they'll find?,"Rolls his eyes. Shut up, you're missing the point. Now, they think that I'm on penicillin.",Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.
Looks confused. Is this some clEver practical joke that I'm not aware of?,"And as I get better, I get nicer.",Is this some kind of trick?
"Suddenly getting it, laughs. That's brilliant. House smiles.",Foreman thinks I actually value his opinion.,"Central Perk, continued from earlier."
I'll get my shoes. Turns to walk away but stops. So we don't need to talk about...,No.,"Uh, Mon, youyou gonna leave your shoes out here?"
So you're going to keep screwing...,"Yeah, and you're going to keep talking about it. We are who we are.",If you say screw you one more time.
"Patient tested positive for syphilis, right?",Is this some sort of recap?,"Hey, hey, be careful with that."
But why did he test positive for syphilis?,Oh! Uh... I know this.,Because he accomplished something.
"Either one, he has syphilis...",I was going to say that.,Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
"Or two, the test was wrong twice, or three, he gave us someone else's blood. House stops.",Who?,"Eh, you dont want to know about the third time."
Who? Smiling. Amber.,Get that idiotic smile out of my face. I've got to go on a killing spree.,"Look, its the same smile she has in the painting."
"Or, four, he has something that tests positive for syphilis.",Sighs. It's not chagas.,Three. Two. One.
He worked in Costa Rica before he was married.,"Is two a spree, or do I have to kill you too? Chagas wouldn't explain the niceness.",Yeah why dont you send that to him in Costa Rica?
"I've heard of remote tribes that actually practice acts of kindness, or the chagas caused encephalitis.",The MRI showed no signs...,"Theres a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin."
"Until we started him on steroids, compromised the immune system and let the infection flare up. I did another one. Shows House. It's not much.",Looks at it. It's plenty. You figured this out because I don't have syphilis? Kutner shrugs. Damn. That should have been my epiphany.,My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
Looks at it. It's plenty. You figured this out because I don't have syphilis? Kutner shrugs. Damn. That should have been my epiphany.,"Good news, bad news. Good news is we know what you have, it's treatable, you're going to live. Both Deb and Jeff smile.","Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need"
What's the bad news?,The cure is a grueling course of pills. It's like one a day for a month.,Hey! So whats the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
Now you're just trying to make me laugh.,"Yeah, like that's a challenge.","Okay, now Im laughing at you."
"You have chagas disease. It's a parasite, it's been asymptomatic for ten years.","Well not quite. Your brain's been swollen, not enough to see but enough to alter your personality.","Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, Ive attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, lets take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, its a koondis!"
Now we're back to that.,"He screamed at you, you don't think he can change?","Well, back to square one."
That was because of the drugs.,So you think drugs are more powerful than parasites?,"I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!"
Smiles. Neither am I.,"Shrugs. Neither am I, but that's because I don't care.",You can stop smiling now.
Opening it. Reviews?,"It was brought to my attention that on occasion, I am not respectful of hospital hierarchy. Sticks a lollypop in his mouth.","Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in."
"The word was contemptuous. Reads over the first review. Well phrased, thoughtful. Flips to next page. Identically phrased. Keeps flicking through. These are all the same.","Because, underneath it all, we are all the same. And Foreman refused to type his up.","Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael."
"Puts the file down. Well, it's more than I expected.",There's an extra one in there.,Go in single file lines.
"Picks it up again and finds the extra one, starts to read it. Your treatment of Patients is non-existent because you're not a doctor, you're an administrator.",Foreman convinced me that these can be helpful.,"I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day Im receptionist again."
"Continues reading. Your Management of employees is, well, let's face it, they're outside carrying signs. Stops reading and puts it down. The strike ended, the nurses have been back for two shifts already.",You'd think I'd have noticed.,We really need a strike here.
Smiles. I got a call from Amber today. Says there's been a violation of your contract. You've been seeing Wilson on her time.,"She breached confidentiality. You can let it slide, Officer. We're Even.","Ooh! Things with Donna are so... ohhoho! Theyre going great. I, uh... were just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. Im actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!"
Everything else is great. I just... I don't know. I guess I don't like ketchup anymore. Wonder what else I don't like. Deb looks worried while Jeff continues to eat.,Roll over. Patient rolls over with some help from Amber.,"Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?"
We need a tougher punishment.,Want to come over to the poopy side? Where are you two going Friday night?,"It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future."
Dinner at L'auberge.,Stares at her. You're lying.,"The Restaurant, after dinner."
"Um. Where are you going? My apartment's on the West Side. to the back of the driver's head Excuse me. You need to go the other way. Hey, did you hear what I said? as he reaches for the car door, the lock drops down What the hell is going on here? What do you want?",driving the car An autographed picture would be nice. Oh! And I'm also gonna save your life.,"Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom."
Just let me go. I won't press charges. Forget the whole thing.,"That's pRobably true, seeing as how you have a brain tumor.",How am I supposed to let it go?
You're that nut-job doctor that keeps calling my publicist.,"Actually, I'm the nut-job head of diagnostic medicine.","Hey, guys, dont forget, my episodes on TV tomorrow night."
"I run Every day. I don't get headaches. I'm fine. So, if you don't mind!","Actually, I do mind. I don't care if you die. But if Brock Sterling dies, Anna nEver finds out he's the father of Marie's baby.","I think Im gonna go for a run, you want to come?"
"But if Brock Sterling dies, Anna nEver finds out he's the father of Marie's baby. yells Help!","stands, echoing Evan Help!",Now I cant believe it!
getting out of the car Make it cab fare. I don't want you anywhere near my House.,"tossing the keys to a passing employee Uh, just put it in my spot.","Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car."
So I just press this button Every time I see a light?,"It tells me where your blind spots are. So! the twins They're gonna turn out to be yours, aren't they.",Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
I told you. I can't talk about that stuff.,"But you want to be done with this, right?",No! No! I told you everything! No! No!
"sighs One's mine, one's Julio's.",I knew it. pumps his fist Julio knocked her up before her appendix burst. You got her after.,"And yknow what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio."
How can you watch that stuff?,'Cause it's awesome.,Watch whatever you want.
It's preposterous. Not one real moment since I've been on the show.,"As opposed to shows that represent the world exactly the way it is, like! I can't think of any.","Oh! like what?! Oh Im sorry, I dont mean to pry... its just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch Access Hollywood."
enters What's going on?,Hospital is being inspected and Cuddy dispatched you to keep an eye on me.,I think I would have remembered that.
What's the test say?,"As I suspected, you have significant losses in the upper right quadrant of your visual field.","Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!"
Are you serious?,"No, it's a joke.",All right.
That readout says his vision's fine.,"No, it doesn't.",Youre taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
You lied to me?,I kidnapped you. You're surprised that I lied to you? Evan jumps out of the chair and grabs his jacket It just means that the symptoms are intermittent.,Yeah. Its cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
You kidnapped him?,It's sweet that I haven't lost the ability to surprise you.,"Im not kidnapping him, Im keeping him until I get what I want."
It's sweet that I haven't lost the ability to surprise you.,Are you mocking me?,Lady...you never stop surprising me.
My back. My back is killing me.,Don't care. Busy.,"My back is sore, Dwight."
Amber's damn mattress.,"Well that sucks. Don't buy a new one. He takes a syringe from a drawer, locks the cart, grabs his cane and turns to leave. Wilson follows","Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!"
Are you being sarcastic? Because we are buying one.,She's incapable of doing anything that matters without turning it into a zero-sum game.,"Which we are, andand we already paid for it."
We're buying a mattress for us.,Wow.,"Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!"
What the hell are you doing?,He needs an MRI.,What you doing?
He needs an MRI.,Give me one millimeter slices from the cortex down.,"Well, maybe you didnt want it to end?"
Any particular reason you decided to sedate a Patient for a procedure that's completely painless?,trying on Evan's sunglasses Guy has a history of violent outbursts during surgical procedures.,"Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch."
"Yeah, on TV. It's Evan Greer. He's the main stud on House's soap. Frontal cortex looks clean. No tumors.",Increase the magnification on the occipital lobe. You watch because you like or because I like?,Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases.
I was unemployed. I,"Bzzt. Sorry. That's not an answer, that's an apology. If we're Ever to come out of the darkness, we have to be proud","Well, I didnt get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren."
"Occipital, frontal and temporal lobes are clean. So's the optic nerve. Definitely no tumors.",He's fine?,Glad I could help.
"Uh, what should we tell him?",See if you can talk him out of suing me.,"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
Foot numbness has a huge differential.,It gets a lot narrower when you add in peripheral vision pRoblems.,"Yes, hows this Theyre so uncomfortable its like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!"
He already kidnapped and sedated a guy against his will. Makes sense he'd also do something to numb his foot so he couldn't leave.,But it doesn't make sense to include the symptom that he caused in a differential he's so desperate to solve.,"Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the persons will, so Michael asported him."
Unless he didn't mean to cause it.,"Stick to the filing, sweetheart. Let the doctors do the doctoring. Either toxins or a vitamin deficiency",Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
"I'm guessing when you drugged him, you didn't catch him and ease him to the floor. He could have pinched a nerve in his ankle when he fell. You need to run an EMG test for motor nerve entrapment or the inspector will own your ass.","Kutner, leave the room. Wait thirty minutes, come back and tell her the test was negative.",Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
Is it okay if I use that time to do the test?,Get out of here.,I have a test for business school tomorrow night.
emptying a plastic bag of papers on the desk The rest of them can help me with all this stuff.,They're busy.,You have a desk.
Why don't you have Rico do it?,You can't tell me you didn't notice that pause.,Why not? Penny did it.
She's nEver waking up.,"Ah, this is a whole new experience in super high def. I had no idea Marie wore an underwire.",Whats your problem?
What about the way he's holding that stethoscope? His thumb and forefinger are meeting at an odd angle.,Could be demylenation from toxic exposure.,That is crooked on that side.
"Yeah, excellent job so far. House, outside.",Keep watParkng. You'll nEver guess what Rico's got in that box.,"Well, youre doing a good job."
You have an obsession with an actor or the character he plays. I feel for you. You need to work it out. But I need you to do it when the hospital's accreditation and my job are not on the line.,You want the star of the hottest daytime drama on TV to die in your hospital?,There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
"No, I want you to cure him without committing any more felonies.",I can't do my job if you're going to tie my hands like that.,"No, Im just gonna help him, you know, get deUrsulaized, like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her."
Fifty-one weeks out of the year I let you run around like a monkey in a banana factory. All I'm asking is that you tone it for a few days.,I want that TV.,Oh. Oh. Oh. One thing you need to know about me. I dont quit until something tears or pops. You look like youre getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
We're not bargaining.,You want something. Either you're bargaining or you're begging.,We are NOT signing those papers.
Me keeping my job is good for you.,"Yes, but it's better for you. I just want us to be equally happy.","Great, so you want me to stay at a job Im not happy at?"
approaches EMG was negative for nerve entrapment. Means the foot's a real symptom. Could be vitamin deficiency.,Or a toxin.,"No, no, Im not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you havent slept with any of your coworkers."
Or a toxin. Or atherosclerosis.,Or a toxin.,Are you kidding?
Why is toxin a better idea?,Might not be. We'll know after I'm finished searParkng his set and dressing room for medically relevant stuff. Gotta go. Need a decision.,Youre kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
You're not going to cut your own throat.,"Yeah, that sounds like me. to Kutner Test for heavy metals, organics, biotoxins and search the home.","If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, youd say the razor worked."
Really. Just as long as I get to help you break it in.,Pack your Manhood on ice. Maybe the hospital can reattach it.,"Oh sure, and when youre ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right."
calling from the store You were so wrong. She's letting me choose.,You choose does not mean you choose.,"I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones."
"Really? Sounded like you choose. I suppose it's possible she meant House is soooo, so wrong.",It's a trap.,"No, youre supposed to say, Rock the house."
Amber doesn't do passive-aggressive.,People who do aggressive don't like to limit themselves. Could a leaky space heater cause vision pRoblems and numbness?,"Oh, you mean passiveaggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?"
He'd of gotten better at the hospital. It's not a trap.,Did I hear a question mark at the end of that sentence?,And here I am in the trap.
"House, look, she's",Gotta go. hangs up,"The beach house, Phoebe is coming down the stairs all packed and ready to go."
"The gin bottles are all gifts from fans. Brock Sterling drinks it on the show but Evan doesn't drink at all. He's on this whole health kick right now. Fruits, nuts did you take those from his dressing room?","No. You're not going to marry Brock, are you? We've been waiting four years for him to make it official with Anna.","Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party."
Are you really a doctor.,"Glioblastoma. Need more proof? So, no toxins on the set, how about his regular life? Unusual hobbies? Unsavory friends?",Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?
No. I've been out with him. He's as vanilla as they come.,And by out you mean!?,"No, whats he like?"
"Well, I asked him on a date last month. We went out a few times but we weren't right for each other.",Too small or too large?,He asked you out?
Is that medically relevant?,"I'm a doctor and it's relevant to me. So, yes.",Is that a relevant factor?
We nEver got that far. We made out a while then he just said he should go home. He's a real gentleMan.,thinks and looks at the seeds in his hand Now that'd be interesting.,"Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo."
thinks and looks at the seeds in his hand Now that'd be interesting.,He's impotent.,"I hold in my hand, a beet seed."
One bad night and a couple of sunflower seeds and he's got autonomic disregulation.,"It's more than just one. He can't Even remember the last time he was able to salute. It's cool, huh?","Dont listen to him, hes still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system."
B6 wouldn't show up on a tox screen and we didn't find anything at the House.,So all we have to do is filter the B6 out of his blood. Prep him for plasmapheresis.,"Youre a box short on the black, mediumline ballpoints."
Just because he didn't salute doesn't mean he can't.,looks around And can you find out where that voice keeps coming from? And tell it to get out of my head.,"Im sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight."
Plasmapheresis has risks. We should have him spend the night in the sleep lab. See if he gets a reflex erection.,"Confirmation is for wimps and altar boys. We don't need to wait for a reflex. If he can't get engorged the way God intended, he can't get engorged.",Ive read and I dont know anything about this personally but they say prostate stimulation can help.
I'm not showing him my boobs.,"Lack of response to your chest tells us nothing. Thirteen, show him! exhales loudly Where can I find a decent set of knockers around here?","He told me he couldnt show it to me, but he has a gun."
Thus the word atypical.,"In that case, it could be an atypical bunion.",I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigners perspective.
"without pausing from charting Could be Graves Disease. Extreme hyperthyroid disease leads to systemic pRoblems including numbness, vision loss and cardiac arrest.",You want to be here.,"So, you feel like a dad yet?"
I have to be here.,Just say the word. I'll fire Thirteen.,"I am here, right?"
Just sign the forms. Thirteen looks up,Smart move. I was bluffing. She's right. We should fry the thyroid before it fries him.,"Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or."
"Uh! I know it's more exciting this way, but shouldn't we confirm you're right before destroying one of the most important glands in his body?","If that gland has drawn a bulls eye on his heart, then no.","Yeah honey, Im standing right there!"
Nuking his thyroid puts him at risk for vascular lesions and all kinds of cancer. Protocol says we should do an iodine uptake test.,whispers We? aloud Anyone else want to run a useless test while Brock's thyroid plots its next lethal move? Thirteen raises her hand. Kutner and Taub follow It was rhetorical.,"All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, its not a big deal."
"House is right. House stops writing, mid-signature","Seriously? I mean, I am, but you think so?",That was the last signature I needed.
What are you doing here?,Just grabbing a snack.,It cant be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
You keep food in the morgue?,"Well, if I keep it in the lounge, Everyone else eats it.",No! Thats where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
holding up a food container with someone's name on it That's 'cause it's Everyone else's food.,Oh. I thought it was just Everyone else's bags.,The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
throwing Everything in a covered trash can The accreditation board will light us on fire for this.,"They're not going to find out. Unless, of course, Conway planned on inspecting the morgue in, say! two minutes. feigning ignorance Is that why you're here?","Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run."
You're going to get me fired over a sandwich?,No. Over a TV. And you're not gonna get fired because you're gonna fold.,"I am not gonna get fired, because Im not gonna act on it."
"No, I won't.",But you're gonna push it.,No I wont.
Dr. Jaime Conway. I've heard your name.,"Most people have. It's also a noun. pause I sometimes come down here to relax, unwind. Maybe grab a",Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid buildup.
Sweet Sauce. Conway stares,It's a nickname.,"Oh let her in, Brusco, Im hungry."
An ironic nickname. Wow. It is almost two. Aren't you supposed to be!,"Oh, yeah.","Its a nickname, Ill explain later."
Thanks for the warning.,Any time. leaves,"Hey, I hear what your saying, okay?"
Doesn't the doctors' lounge have that same TV?,"Nope. They've got a 12 inch, exactly like the one that used to be in here.",This is where I thought the barca lounger could go!
Files are done.,I'll be doing a dance of joy just as soon as my leg is healed. to the maintenance men Can you tilt that down?,"Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! Youre kidding! Youre kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!"
"I know the paperwork annoys you, but Patient records are important. You can't just let them sit there.",I had to.,"Yeah, its crazy."
You miss me. You hired Thirteen to replace me.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. All pretty girls are fungible. You're avoiding.",Paaamolaaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
I miss the job. I miss running around playing private investigator. I miss... the puzzles.,"Seriously. I'll fire Thirteen. Or Kutner, if you think Thirteen is hot.","Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything."
His kidneys are failing.,I told you to nuke his thyroid.,Because were broken up.
It's a good thing we didn't. Kidney failure means it wasn't graves.,"So, your test screwed me and our Patient's kidneys. You practically poisoned him with iodine.","Im not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him."
Which he could have handled easily if his kidneys were healthy. All we did was rEveal a new symptom. Usually you're all for that.,Must be the rancid tinge of betrayal that's put me off.,"And sometimes, Ill want you to steal third, and Ill go like this."
You were wrong.,turning on him So tell me to my face. You nEver hesitated before. The Board's turned you into a coward.,Oh youll probably take care of that on your hands.
I did it because it was the right thing to do.,You did it to pass an inspection.,I did it for my son.
Does it matter? Kidney failure on top of the other symptoms points to an autoimmune condition which means that any of his other organs could be next. We've already started dialysis. We need to run ANAs for autoimmune.,"You're right. You and the team, go measure the ceilings.","Oh, Im sorry, Shelly, I cant see it."
"You and the team, go measure the ceilings. Excuse me?",Accreditation board guidelines state that no object can be less than 18 inches from the ceiling. Make sure we're in compliance.,"Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?"
There's nothing in our office that would be less than!,I don't mean us. I mean the whole hospital.,"Still, Id really like to see this office with you in the bosss chair."
Have you met me? I can take care of me. I need you to take care of you. I have work to do.,You made it to page 8. Mysterious hospital visit for soap doc.,Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
"Wow. I'll be sure to send my Mom a copy. They told me I have an autoimmune disease, like lupus or sarcoidosis.",That's what we're here to find out.,Hey guys check it out!
You really as good as Everyone seems to think you are?,Are you really as miserable as Everyone seems to think you are?,Youre good. Youre not as good as you think you are.
I just want to do something that matters.,"Nothing matters. We're all just cockroaches, wilDebeests dying on the river bank. Nothing we do has any lasting meaning.",Well I just wanted to say Im doing it.
And you think I'm miserable.,"If you're unhappy on the plane, jump out of it.","But Im hanging out with my friend, and were having fun."
I want to but! I can't.,Mmm. That's the pRoblem with metaphors. They need interpretation. Jumping out of a plane is stupid.,"I want to, but I dont think I can."
"Well, what if I'm not in a plane? What if I'm just in a place I don't want to be?",That's the other pRoblem with metaphors.,"Uhm... You know, once were in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin..."
So you're afraid of change?,"No, you're afraid to change.","Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it."
"When I get out of here, I'm not gonna be afraid anymore. I mean, how Many guys get a second chance?",Too Many. Half the people I save don't deserve a second chance.,You really want to go out there again?
And to your other sister.,You realize you're reciting lines from last season?,"Alright, this goes without saying, but Im just going to say it anyway."
We're gonna do all the things I promised. Just help me get out of this bed.,Cooling blankets in here.,"Come on, lets get you to bed."
We've got him on broad-spectrum antibiotics but he's slipped from delirium into a coma.,"Good news is the last time Brock was in a coma, he fathered two Parkldren.","Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nicelooking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch lets put your dad here. Lets put your dad in a nursing home."
Unless it's a fungus. We could see that under a microscope.,"Test him for fungi, parasites, all creatures great and small.","Oh sure, a little piece."
Where are you going?,To lie down. I need to think.,"Not in a thousand years, Catherine."
To lie down. I need to think.,Could be rat bite fEver. But his glands aren't swollen. Which one are you gonna get?,So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
She told me to get the one I want.,"So get it. Listeria explains the sepsis, possibly also the heart pRoblem.",I told her Id have to think about it.
But not the numbness.,If the listeria caused encephalomyelitis which then caused the numbness.,Not when youre sitting in that chair.
I want a waterbed.,Wow.,"Nono, its okay."
I've always wanted one. I know it's ridiculous. It's just! There's something nice about the thought of being rocked to sleep in water. pause No mocking? No Freudian analysis of how the waterbed is really a great big vagina I want to crawl into?,I'm ignoring you because you make me sad. He's on ampicillin. Which means if it's listeria he would have shown some improvement.,Why dont you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
No. It's a whole! thing. You need special sheets and insurance and,Who cares? You wanted one your whole life. You're a grown up. You can afford it. Stores sell them.,Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
"Most adults don't go through life the way you do, House, indulging our Every whim.",You don't deserve to be happy.,"Oh, of course, because Im the only adult around here."
And yet I am. You?,"It is stupid. he puts down the pillow and starts to leave Live the dream, Wilson.","No. But I am, I am human, right?"
"It is stupid. he puts down the pillow and starts to leave Live the dream, Wilson.",It's not an infection. It's an allergy. That's why it's not responding to antibiotics.,That does not sound stupid to me.
"This isn't a soap opera, House. People don't just wake up from comas the second you give them drugs.",Especially if we give them the wrong drugs. What'd the tests say?,"Oh, I dont watch soap operas."
It was negative for fungus and parasites. But that doesn't mean,"The more infections we rule out, the more likely it is that it's not an infection.",Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
"He has no history of allergies or asthma. Most importantly, none of his symptoms remotely resemble an allergic reaction.",Allergens could trigger an allergic vasculitis. That would explain the symptoms.,"Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?"
One in a million times. Septic infection always explains his symptoms.,But an infection is nEver resistant to Every antibiotic.,"Yeah, it makes me sick."
An infection is rarely resistant,And allergy nEver responds to antibiotics. NEver beats rarely. QED I won. There were chrysanthemums in his dressing room.,Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
My God. Why didn't you say he'd been exposed to plant life.,"Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrins, a neurotoxin and a know allergen.",Oh. You couldnt have watered it?
"He has an infection. If we give him steroids, we'll kill him.","He has an allergy. If we don't give him steroids, we'll kill him.",Oh that explains all the womens underwear.
Not as fast.,Fast enough. We don't have time for the rest of the tests. We have to do something. And what we're doing right now isn't working.,Thats the only logical inference.
Fast enough. We don't have time for the rest of the tests. We have to do something. And what we're doing right now isn't working.,A hundred milligrams methylprednisilone.,Why dont we just do it now?
A hundred milligrams methylprednisilone. Patients' names?,It's one Patient.,"Come on, Rachel, come on!"
You want to give one Patient a hundred milligrams? That'll jump-start a car.,Perfect. The Patient's in a '69 Ford Coma.,"To jump start a car, first pop the hood."
"Anything over 50 milligrams, I need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy. It's protocol. And the inspector's here.","I am 99% certain that she'll consent. he heads behind the counter For the sake of the 1%, why don't I just!","Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, yknow."
You're not allowed back here.,"Well, tell the inspector he can put it on my tab.",You should not be here.
100 milligrams of methylprednisilone is an overdose.,We were wrong about the infection. He's suffering from a sEvere allergic reaction.,He just told me at the counter.
The team hasn't finished the test for allergy. His symptoms don't,"In rare cases! Trust me. At the end of this conversation, I'm right.",You know what I think your problem is?
Then confirm it. Get a blood test.,What is it about this sEvere and deepening coma that makes you think we got time for protocol?,"So, I uh I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby."
Protocol has saved your Patient from having his thyroid destroyed and his blood drained.,"If you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong. Don't talk about protocol.","Okay, let me tell you what were looking for."
My job's on the line. You're job is on the line.,Okay.,"What do you mean, take my job?"
He was still right. It was an allergy.,To what?,"Well, maybe he was right."
To what? Thank you.,I was wrong. to Cuddy You should have stopped me. he leaves,What? Oh my God! To who?
"And as thrilled as I am about The Lady Slipper being the best nightclub Port Lawrence has Ever seen, doesn't compare to the happiness that I feel when Hello?",Don't hang up. What was the verdict?,My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to Kings Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.
"What was the verdict? $200,000 fine.",You should have been fired.,I was found guilty and fined $533.
"Good night, House.",There are bubbles in his glass.,Good night guys.
Can't this wait until,My Patient is allergic to quinine. Cuddy turns on the light and sits up.,Now I cannot wait to see this.
And you got this from bubbles?,The symptoms started two months ago. It's also when Brock started downing gin and tonics like a Brit staving off malaria. The gin was fake. The tonic was real.,"Uhhuh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!"
And tonic water is loaded with quinine. Huh. Nice job.,You should've been fired.,You know its just herbal tea.
I'm taking back the TV.,I saved his life.,"Hey, guys, I need to use your TV."
That wasn't the deal.,The contract clearly stated no takesy backsides.,That was never agreed upon.
"Good night, House.",What are you wearing.,"Night, you guys."
"Good night, House.","Good night, Cuddy.",Good night Sheldon.
Do you like that?,Uh...I don't know.,You like that do ya?
Do you want me to use my butt again?,House sees a very short flashback of someone bleeding. I don't know how I got here. Exhales into his hand and smells his breath. How Many drinks did I have?,"Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt."
Your scotch hasn't Even arrived yet.,That means I was drunk when I got here.,"Yeah, Ill have a scotch"
Still dancing. What do you mean?,That's four words. The accepted diagnostic test for global memory impairment is five random words.,"Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?"
Are you okay?,I'm...Dancer sits on his lap. Trying to find that out. Give me five... Animals.,"Well you do a lot, so just dont."
Um...Cat. Bird. Monkey. Rhino. Goldfish.,"Closes his eyes. Monkey, Rhino... Grabs his head. Either I'm massively drunk Looks at blood on fingertips.","After much deliberation, weve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet."
"Sees the blood on his hand. Oh, you're bleeding.",Or it's someone else's blood. Do you see a wound? Dancer winces as she looks at his scalp. How bad is it?,Or a gong.
It's all over.,"I have a concussion. Retrograde amnesia. Pats his pockets. I have no keys, no phone. I've been mugged.",All right! So thats it! Its over! Everybody knows!
No you haven't. You already gave me a twenty.,Did you earn it?,Of course I have!
Did you earn it? Not yet.,Someone is going to die.,I didnt get one.
Looks alarmed and yells toward the bouncer. Kenny!,"Not you. I saw something, a symptom. Someone is going to die unless I find them.","Okay. On the count of three, Ill shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out."
Someone is going to die unless I find them. Who?,I have no idea. Keep the change.,Some dead man.
I have no idea. Keep the change.,I saw somebody dying.,Keep the change.
You saw thirty people flying into glass and metal.,I saw a symptom before the crash.,"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, yknow?"
"You're concussed. You don't know what you saw and you don't know when you saw it. A week ago, you noticed a symptom in a soap star.",Bad argument. Since I was right about that.,You also got a nosebleed watching Up.
Finishes pulling stuff out of Houses head. That's all of it. A few stitches will hold your brain in place. Starts trying to put in the first stitch.,Pulls away. Ow!,It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
Hey! Hold your head still unless you want me to sew your nose under your eye.,Why was I taking the bus?,Why are you looking at my forehead?
Because you were drunk.,What if I saw someone and I followed them on from... Somewhere in Princeton?,Because youre too smart to trust a drunk.
Somewhere in Princeton? You okay?,Perfect. Uh...Uh...You. Points to Taub. Get histories from Everyone in here.,So where did you study?
Did you just forget his name?,No. To Thirteen Lesbian. Find out if anybody on that bus was taken to other hospitals.,"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know."
You just forgot mine.,"No, Thirteen. I just wanted to call you a lesbian.",Dont even get me started on yours!
I'm not a lesbian.,"I was rounding up, from 50%. To Kutner Find my cane and motorcycle. Figure out where I went last night.",Okay! I justI didnt know that you are a lesbian.
Pulls out a pen and opens a file. Where's your cane and motorcycle? And where'd you go last night?,You're going to trust me? I lie about Everything. The three of them leave.,Were wedged between the copier and the railing.
You're going to trust me? I lie about Everything. The three of them leave.,How much bigger could it get?,But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one?
"You don't think it's House motions for Wilson to get the crutch nearby for him. Wilson grabs it and hands it to House. A little weird that there's both a giant crash and a simultaneous, mysterious symptom sighting? House realises something.",What if it's not a coincidence?,"Another Waiting Room, Phoebe and Joey are trying to find out where the guy with the broken leg is."
You mean like the hand of God reaParkng down and screwing with you?,That... Or the symptom caused the crash. Looks around. Did you see anybody in a bus driver's uniform?,"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be."
That... Or the symptom caused the crash. Looks around. Did you see anybody in a bus driver's uniform?,"Right here. Purpura on Ralph Klamden's neck, indicative of leukaemia. Caused a bleed in the brain, and hence the accident.","Okay, driver, driver, if youre not gonna stop this bus, then Im going to stop it for you."
I have leukaemia?,"No, we just ruled that out, pay attention. To Wilson He pRobably had a seizure.","Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella."
I didn't have a seizure. I got hit by a garbage truck.,Which you drove into while you were seizing.,"Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, theres injury."
You saw the bus driver exhibiting the initial stages of a seizure and didn't bother telling him to pull over?,Hey! House walks over to one of the crash victims being wheeled out in a wheelchair by a nurse. Nobody leaves here until I say they can be discharged.,Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.
She said I was,Is she me? Feels his forehead. You have a fEver.,Youre kidding! Did you tell her I wasnt?
"No, I'm fine. 98.6.",I need him to stay.,"Yes, 98.6. Youre gonna be fine."
I just have a stiff neck from the crash.,Stiff neck. Yells to Everyone in the ER. This Man has meningitis. We need to quarantine the whole ER. No one leaves here until their full workup is complete.,"And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it."
You left here at 523 p.m. Your motorcycle nEver made it home.,"Well, that covers ten seconds out of the four hours I can't remember. Where else did you look?","Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley."
The other eight were taken over to Princeton General.,Looking through the files. It would be helpful if these came with head shots and resumes.,"Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill."
"Reading off one of the files. Twenty-something year-old Jane Doe. Kidney contusion, laceration on her leg",Both of which are expected complications when someone goes from 60 to 0 in no seconds flat.,How can reading my journal be an accident?
The weirdest thing we've got is a ruptured spleen.,"Okay, new plan. We make a list of all the bars between here and the crash site. Find out where I went, we go there","And theres a country called Argentinaaaa, its a place Ive never seeeeen."

We're going to go to the ER and do our jobs.,Someone is dying because I can't remember,"Hey, what are you guys gonna do?"
"Medical hypnosis can bring the brain to a class II theta state, increasing focus and memory retrieval.","You're not doing to make me do the Parkcken dance, are you?","Nothing, its just that hypnosis is beyond crap."
In a soft voice. Just relax. Keep letting go of any intrusive thoughts.,"Lying back with his eyes closed. So what, you saw an ad on the back of a comic book?","Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?"
Wilson is done talking now. Chase glares at Wilson. Visualize the bus. The way it looked. The way it smelled. The people on it. What they look like.,"This is a waste of... Suddenly House is on the bus, which is empty. Time. Looks around. Cool. Chase appears on the bus in front of him.","Phoebes cab. Phoebe is driving very fast, and a terrified Ross has closed his eyes."
Focus on the details.,The bus is empty.,Stay on target.
"Shh. Resumes talking to House. Just focus. Clear your mind. Back on the bus, now Wilson is there too. Think back to how you felt. Details you saw.","Looks around. I can't see out the windows, and I can see you guys.","First I want to say that its not Sheldons fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadnt drugged him he would have taken it to his grave."
"Why did you get so drunk at five in the afternoon, alone?","I need a reason? Looks to his right and Wilson is sitting next to him. God, I hate 'beer' brand beer.","I just felt like drinking alone, because Im deep and dark."
"When he's hypnotized, can he lie? He...","I can be mistaken, but I can't actually lie under hypnosis. Continues drinking.","Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me!"
What are you running away from?,"When I'm drinking without you? What am I running away from? Hmm, One of those imponderables. Can you hold off on your insecurities until we find this Patient?",Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
Do you see anyone in the bar?,"Looks around sees some people playing pool, some just drinking, all of them have no faces.","Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar?"
He's concerned about you. Why does that mean he's insecure?,To Wilson Will you get your girlfriend out of here?,"Oh, why would he do this?"
Amber's there? You've got Amber in your head?,You put her in my head. I can't Even have a conversation with you in my subconscious without her tagging along.,"Amber, I want you to know that Ill always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother."
Well she better have her clothes on.,Sighs Unfortunately. Pause I didn't mean to say that out loud.,"Whoa, hey, that ladys all kinds of naked."

Where are you going?,"To smell a bus, obviously. Taub, Thirteen and Kutner follow him out. Foreman stays behind.","Well were not gonna put out stumps, come on."
Why are you smelling the passengers' clothes?,Smell is the most powerful evokerater of memory. Takes a couple of Vicodin. I need to get back on that bus.,"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
Okay. So why are you taking so much Vicodin?,"If Cuddy asks, blocking the pain helps focus the memory.","Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?"
"You split your head open, you should rest. Hands him another piece of clothing. Anything?",A hint of... Exploded bus. Takes another couple of Vicodin.,How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?

You're wrong. It's not working.,"So, you're saying I'm not here. Walking towards the bus driver.","No no, its not working on me."
"If this were a real memory, you'd be limping. House looks down and notices that he isn't limping. And you wouldn't be talking to me. I'm obviously a hallucination.",Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.,"No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty."
Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.,We're both in my head. You'd think one of us would have noticed the blood.,"Oh, okay. II ate way too much."
Why haven't you had a head CT yet?,Who do you want me to treat? Me or you? Did you have a seizure?,Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?
Dumb question. The brain's too fried during a seizure to form memories.,"Dumb answer. I wasn't asking you, I was asking me. Because you've already proven that you're not here.","Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that!"
I'm getting a headache.,Is that a clue?,"Oh no, I just decided not to."
"He can't. House turns around and sees that same dark haired Woman from earlier on, now there are other passengers around. The hallucination is your messed up brain's way of reasoning out a pRoblem.",You weren't on the bus.,"Holy crap, Morty."

"When you were under hypnosis, you were talking to Amber?",I wanted to see her naked.,And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
"Seriously, what were you hiding?",I want to see her naked.,Were you hiding from me?
You want to see Everyone naked. Why would you hide that?,"Laughs. Well some guys get upset when you objectify their girlfriends. But if you're okay, I've got a digital video camera. So we could",I couldnt say that I was naked because shes allowed too see me naked.
"Why would I be upset that you're treating my girlfriend like you treat Every other Woman on the planet, unless...You're not? Unless it's deeper than that. You WEREN'T objectifying her.","Trust me. I want to do some very nasty, demeaning stuff to your girlfriend.","Listen, Im gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you."
It's a longitudinal fracture of the temporal bone.,I banged my head.,I dont know how to spell it.

Im going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. Ill be forced to be some large mans tutor.
We've scanned his head five times. Looks at House and notices blood dripping from his ear. You're bleeding.,A little thing called a bus crash. It's just a scalp laceration. It could be hidden in his optic Parkasm.,"Ok, its very faint, but I can still sense him in the building."
It's coming from your ear. You think that's a good thing?,Ignores Foreman. But that would have affected his eyesight. I need to take a bath.,I think its coming from your bag.
"Hallucinations and smells were kind of working, right? Why the bath?",Hypnosis gave me a nose picker.,"Please, could you just try it for me?"
I don't think I was Even born when that movie was out.,Well then you're too young to be a doctor. That movie was released in 1980.,Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?
That was twenty-eight years ago.,"No, it wasn't, shut up.",It was a long time ago.
Did you just forget what year it is?,No.,"Ah, no. Right month, wrong year."

Gets up and walks over to House. Then I guess this isn't a memory. It's a fantasy.,"If it's a fantasy, you'd be wearing... This. Cuddy clothes suddenly change to a much skimpier outfit.",Rajs apartment. He wakes up clutched in the arms of the large lady. Tries to get away. She clutches him tighter. He shrugs and goes back to sleep.
"You're convinced your Patient is dying, and you want to waste your time with a sex fantasy?",Don't blame me. Blame my gender.,"In the future, when a girl asks for some illadvised sympathy sex."
"Well, I'm not here to indulge that. I'm here to help you figure out what symptom you saw. Your Patient was driving the bus, so all you could see",Why can't you do both?,I think Im gonna takeoff.
"Your Patient was driving the bus, so all you could see was him sitting down. Most likely facing forward.",House smiles as he watches Cuddy.,"The Hospital, the camera is placed as though it were Bens eyes."
Could indiCate aortic insufficiency.,Marfan's syndrome.,Did I do something?
Or syphilis. Takes off her skirt. She is now just wearing her white bra and underwear - which are glowing under the black light - and her black stiletto's as she swings around the pole to face House again.,What if his earlobes were just drooping?,All right. Woman hasnt tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly shes not decent?
What if his earlobes were just drooping? Ehlers-Danlos?,Or cutis laxa.,Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
It's not fatal in adults. She turns around. With her back to House she unclips her bra.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's an adult, very good point. Keep going. She holds her bra up and turns around to House again who is leaning forward watParkng very closely.","Im sorry! This never happened to me before! Im an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!"
"I'm distracting you. She stops dancing, and sits down beside House. She's wearing a suit again.","Screams. No! Dance, Woman!","Alright, well, Im gonna go get dressed for the dance."
You'd rather be diagnosing.,I screamed no.,Heading to Philly.
"Hey, over here. House looks up at the bus driver and Cuddy disappears. Remember me? I'm the sick guy. House gets up and walks over, without limping.",Tell me what I saw.,"Oh, just like I said."
Was it the blood dripping from my ear? Shows House his ear which is dripping blood.,That doesn't make sense. Because your shirt wasn't stained. And because that was me. House's ear starts bleeding.,What are you doing to do with that letter.
"I could have had a subtle hemiballismus, indicating the early stages of Huntington's.",Huntington's wouldn't explain the abdominal pain. And it's only on the table because we're thinking of Thirteen.,"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with."
A shuffling gait could suggest Parkinson's.,Except there's no such thing as shuffling sitting.,What sort of hobble?
Appears behind him. He moved when he helped the old lady up the steps.,Turns around and walks over to her. Who are you?,The stairwell. Amy is helping Leonard up the stairs.
I'm the answer. Look.,At what?,"Alright, here, you want an answer the answer is"
"Here. House turns around, the bus is full of people and the Bus Driver is helping an old lady up the steps.",To Mystery Woman.,"The Hallway Between The Apartments, Ross and Rachel are coming back from the hospital."
Help him up.,Jumps up. I got it! It's Parkinson's.,Help him! Someone help him!
House. Your ear.,Start him on levodopa.,Pennys apartment door.
You should sit down. House!,Get that out of my face.,Do sit down.
Welcome back. I'm Nurse Dickerson.,I don't need your name. And I got your profession from your super competent technique of melting my retinas.,"Hey, Pam... its Jim. Um, I have a doctors appointment in the city. So I probably wont be in till the late afternoon. Just thought Id let you know. Okay, bye."
Verbal faculties seem to be intact. Do you remember passing out?,I remember puking on Cuddy's shoes. Turns his head. Ow.,"No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me."
Yeah. Skull fractures tend to hurt.,It'd hurt a lot less if you didn't swipe my pain pills.,Didnt it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?
Dr. Cuddy's orders. Wants me to regulate the amount,"Sees a security guard standing near the door. Wait a second, you brought muscle?","I told you, you cant regulate every aspect of our lives."
Dr. Cuddy's orders.,Means I was wrong.,And what are those orders?
Thank you. But Wilson's wouldn't explain Phone rings and he answers it. Foreman.,Lying on his couch using his mobile. How did you eliminate Parkinson's?,"Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex."
"Well, the tests confirmed the abdominal pain was caused by liver failure.",I assume you've already ruled out hepatitis and Wilson's.,"Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart."
Give him five minutes. Brainstorming a few possibilities isn't going to explode his brain.,"Then if she's wrong, that makes this phone call that much more exciting. What about hepatic fibrosis?",Isnt it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
It could be thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.,Did I mention this diagnosis needs to make sense?,"So, where were we?"
"Why doesn't it make sense? The bus driver's Asian, his potassium is slightly low","If he got paralysed while driving the bus, don't you think I would have gotten off at the next stop?","Shut up. Lets just get Koothrappali and go. Lucky bastard. Its got to be that stupid accent of his. Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, Im stumped."
Not if the next stop was at a 90 degree angle into an SUV.,"The bus would have slowed, I would have noticed","Fine. Were travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now lets assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, well be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and oh look, they built a new putput course."
TPP has all the confirmed symptoms. There's no downside to testing.,Genetic test is too slow. Nurse takes phone away from him so he yells out. Run the bagel test!,"You hid behind a tree yelling get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah."
Answers it. Yeah?,In his bathroom using a different phone.,You gonna answer it?
I told you not to lock the door.,Yells out. Still wiping! To Kutner. Put the phone up to bus driver's grill. Kutner does as he's told and House listens to the bus driver's breathing.,I made him tell us.
Who are you talking to?,My large colon. To Kutner. TPP is not consistent with your Patient's laboured breathing.,"Okay. Youve got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and youll be as good as new."
Did you take my cell phone?,My large colon did. I'm negotiating its release.,I thought your phone got stolen.
I'm negotiating its release. Help!,What's happening?,Im going to get it.
The test worked. He collapsed.,"You're half right. He's wheezing, isn't he?","Besides, I dont need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair?"
"He's wheezing, isn't he? Yeah.",You can't wheeze without moving your chest muscles. This isn't TPP.,"Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carols great and Im sure youre a very attractive man, but I."
Then what is it?,Well how am I supposed to know? I'm not there! Hangs up the phone.,"Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean."
It must be a pulmonary embolism. Cuddy walks in with House.,So why haven't you pushed a vial of tPA?,What? What? We did?
I asked him back in.,At the tail end of me Patiently explaining how you idiots were idiots.,"All right, so well ask him to come back."
We pushed tPA ten minutes ago.,That means it's not a clot.,"Come on guys, PUSH!"
Get him to the OR to suck it out.,Must have just screwed up the intubation. Checks the tube. Seal's good.,Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
"It's a clot, House. They start moving him out.","Wait, wait. They stop. Look at his teeth. He's got shiny new caps. He's had recent dental surgery.","Im sorry Im late, what happened?"
House! House!,House! Turns around and sees Thirteen standing there. Oh. To Thirteen Get a syringe.,"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?"
Yelling through the glass. I didn't bring you back here so you could stage a coup! Kutner tries to open the door but it doesn't budge. Thirteen goes to remove the crutch.,Listen to me.,"Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door."
"Knocks on the glass. Dr. Hadley, open the door. Transcribers note We have a name! From here on out I will be referring to Thirteen as Hadley.",I'm not plumping his pillows here.,"Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve oclock."
I can't risk you stabbing him in the heart looking for an unconfirmed air bubble.,Stab him.,Dont blow too hard.
Bangs on the glass again. Dr. Hadley!,See? She doesn't Even know your name. Yells. Stab his heart! MaParknes start beeping.,"Michael, just give us our clients back."
Looks at the screen. Sat's at 75.,"Yes, he's suffocating.","Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs."
If you're wrong,"Shut up and make a decision. You keep standing there, he's dead either way.","Oh, dear Lord, a police officers glancing in our direction."
Open that door. Hadley stabs his heart just as they finally Manage to get the door open.,Holds up his hands. Don't shoot!,"Phoebes, Phoebe is opening the door."
The O2 sats. MaParknes stop beeping. There was an air bubble. He's okay.,The other nurse always used to tuck me in.,"Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?"
I'll be on the couch. With a shotgun in my lap.,Worrying about me?,So Id be sitting by myself?
Making sure you don't try and make a limp for the border. Get some sleep. Turns out the light.,"I'm not sleepy, Mummy.",Get some rest.
Takes the blanket off and sits up. Me neither.,Who are you? And why are you stalking me?,Whats with the blanket?
"Technically, you're stalking me. She plays with her necklace.",Looks at her necklace which is a yellow orangey colour with something in it. What is that? Mosquito?,"Oh my god, I got my very own stalker."
Maybe just a fly.,In the ointment. So there's something wrong. There's some detail I'm not noticing that's spoiling the big picture.,"In the Martin family, we like to say, Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly."
In the ointment. So there's something wrong. There's some detail I'm not noticing that's spoiling the big picture.,Is this significant? Or is this dream just going in a different direction now?,The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
I guess that depends. Still brushing House's hand against her cheek. What are you going to do with that?,House looks his hand which has a red ribbon in it. I have to tie this around you. Ties it around her leg.,"Well, maybe Ill bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it."
Ties it around her leg. I'm cold.,Stay with me. Why did I say that? Blood starts to ooze onto the ribbon.,"When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket."
Stay with me. Why did I say that? Blood starts to ooze onto the ribbon.,Hey.,"Careful, now. We dont want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
Hey. Go away.,It's not over. She turns around and looks at him. I saved the wrong person. She sits up.,Hes still my older brother.
It's not over. She turns around and looks at him. I saved the wrong person. She sits up.,"This wasn't just a dream or a fantasy, or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland.",It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you.
So the bus driver with the air bubble was just a coincidence?,Nope.,"Its a little coincidental, but believable."
You're not leaving. House walks over to the closet and pulls out a blood pressure arm band and puts it around his arm and starts pumping.,What's the most dangerous thing a Patient could do when his brain is on the brink of herniating?,"Okay, look, Im gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can."
"Elevated heart rate, BP... Which is exactly why you need to stop. House grabs her hand and sticks it on his neck so she can check his heart rate.","Instead of sleeping, I'm going to be pacing around this apartment trying to decipher those visions.",I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
Why does this matter so much?,I don't know. Heart rate?,What is the big deal?
Heart rate? 127,BP? She walks away and grabs a stethoscope. Contextual memory. I need to get back on that bus with all 31 passengers to remember who and what I saw.,"Uh... I have other issues. Im terrible at math. Overweight. You youre in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what."
I'm not going to call in crash victims because you've gone insane.,Maybe I don't need the actual victims.,Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Maybe I don't need the actual victims.,Who's playing Anne McKeehan?,A list of people you mean to kill?
You think that staring at pictures on our shirts is going to be more effective than hypnosis?,"Well, if only you'd stop talking, the re-enactment could stimulate activity in my hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex.",All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
Stands up. Are you okay? House stares into space. What'd you see?,It just slipped away. Takes some pills.,What do you see?
Is that Vicodin?,Nope. Just a little memory pick-me-up.,That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
Are you crazy? Alzheimer's drugs will make your brain go into overdrive.,That's the point. It'll speed up my neuronal firing. Turn up the voltage on my memory.,"Well, its not just doing simple cognitive tasks."
And blow out your heart. How Many did you take?,Just now? Or including the ones I took on the ride over?,And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
"House, this isn't worth House.",Looks to his right and sees the mystery Woman sitting facing him. She is wearing a red scarf now. Why are you here?,"You know what, if you wanna look for a house, thats okay."
You beliEve in reason above all else. There must be a reason.,You have something to tell me.,"Im on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find."
Yes. Who am I?,"That's asking, not telling. Who are you?",Do you know who you are?
You know who I am.,"If I did, I'd be passed out in bed instead of OD'ing on physostigmine on the 6th Street cross-town.","Come on, I mean, you know me, you know."
What's my necklace made of?,Looks down at the necklace. Resin.,"This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the kings fool."
Who am I?,I don't know. Why the guessing game?,"Okay, two things didnt happen."
Because you don't know the answer.,"And if I don't, you don't. But you know the clues.","Because I have balls, and you dont."
I know what's bugging your subconscious. What's my necklace made of?,"Looks at the necklace again, realises and whispers. No.","Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?"
Who am I?,Shakes his head. Doesn't make sense.,I wish there were more.
What's my necklace made of?,Amber.,"The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver."
What's my necklace made of? Amber.,I have to tie this around you. Removes the red scarf from around her neck and uses it as a tourniquet around her right leg.,"Jewellery? Seriously?

Amber. What?,"Amber. It was Amber. Tries to sit up, Cuddy helps his head onto her lap. She was on the bus.","Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, dont tell me, I want to be surprised."
"You almost kill yourself, and all we're getting is drug-induced fantasies.",Have you spoken to her?,It almost feels as if youre about to arrive at the point.

Why do you think Wilson's leaving?,How Many times do I have to use the word idiot?,"He shows promise and Jim, I dont know I hes been a disappointment."
"And that's a good enough answer for you? WhenEver anyone does anything out of the norm, you have to tell them what screwed-up process is really at work in their head. That is why I locked the two of you in a room. So you would say something stupid and insensitive, and maybe with a little bit of truth. But you didn't.

Almost dying changes nothing. Dying changes Everything.,I'm sorry.,"Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed."

You just did the test.,She didn't squint. Which means the eye thinks it's fine.,Does that sound like Janice?
It was wrong.,I know.,Its not right.
"I know. The eye doesn't think. The brain thinks, which means if the thinking's wrong, the brain's wrong. Which means it's spread to the brain, which means it's too late for us to remove the eye. Which means we're gonna have to remove your whole head. Don't worry. He holds up a huge meat cleaver. It doesn't hurt.","Hallucination. That's a brain thing, right?",And we learned that you dont need an eyeball to do that.

"No, none of them had brain issues.","If his pupils dilated, if his pupils were fixed, if there was a twitch...","No, were just four people with neck problems."
"He got hit in the head, he died, no mystery. That was your point.","Yesterday. You live, you learn. Who shot this?",He was murdered by a shadow.
Guy who runs the gym has a camera. Uploads the nasty stuff online.,"Can't see the dead guy's face. I can't see his face. Can't see the twitch, can't see the pupils",Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
I thought I already talked about not judging.,What kind of idiot wears argyle socks with construction boots?,So youre not judging me?
Who is he?,He's apparently a very bad private investigator.,Strong am I with the Force.
"Uh, why is he pretending to fix the coffee maParkne?",Because I wanted to find out what you guys found out before I find out what he found out.,Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?
"The kid has a tummy ache. Also, the dead guy was exposed to mercury, mold, and hydrous perchloric acid because their sex pad was next to a garage that was demolished after those toxins were found. Oh, yeah, that will be $2,300. He pulls a sheet off a mini notepad and hands it to House.",I'll get you a check.,"A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are sitting at a table."
"No, I don't take checks.",You think I'm gonna stop payment?,Will you take a check?
You think I'm gonna stop payment? Aren't you?,"Of course I am, $2,300 is insane.",Yeah. Im paying you to stop.
"No, actually, that price includes footage of the boxing match from four different angles. 30% of the crowd paid by credit card. I got their names. Four of them had digital cameras, which I composited like NASA did for the pics of Mars. You know, the rovers and all that.",Pupils were dilated.,"Actually, I didnt know the magazine was paying for it."
"But he didn't drop his hands, which means he maintained muscle tensity",Say it.,"Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Supermans flight is a feat of strength."
You were right.,"God, that was petty of me.","Well, I didnt hear the phone ring."
Does that PI guy mean we don't have to break into people's homes anymore?,It's the whole reason you went to medical school. I'm not gonna take that away from you.,No. Its just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
He's better than we are.,And costs more. Gonna biopsy the brain.,Some of us are just a little better.
Gonna biopsy the brain. No.,Say it.,"Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon."
"You were right, but no.","Temporal lobe controls speech, hearing, memory. She loses those things, she's gonna be a terrific date, but beyond that",I dont know why Joey had to kiss her!
"We cut out a piece of it, good chance she's a vegetable. Nothing to hear, nothing to say, nothing to look back on.",You're right.,Youre right. Youre right. She seems happy. We dont tell her.
So it's okay to stab his brain because he's old?,"No, it's okay to stab his brain because he's dead if you don't. Get the widow to say yes.","Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"

You're back to cancer?,Metastasis is just a fancy word for screws around.,"No, back to happy."
Any type of cancer?,I don't know.,"Oh, now its a spare room?"
There would be evidence of cancer.,There is. We just haven't found it yet.,It wouldnhelp. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
You need it to be cancer so you have an excuse to talk to Wilson.,"Give me something else that explains this constellation of Patients, then you can call me an ass.","Oh, so thats how it works?"
"Perforated intestine. If this thing started as normal bacteria living in the intestines but got into a blood vessel through a vascular anomaly in the bowel wall, then they would affect Every organ through the blood stream. It screws up Everything. For Everyone.","Okay. It's a long shot. It is possible that I'm an ass. Ironically, we need to do a colonoscopy to confirm.","Its interesting your father didnt help around the house and Howard doesnt help, either, so in a way, Howards not only like your father, but hes also like the child that youre afraid to have."
The anomaly would have to be intermittent or they all would have died within a day.,"She starts getting abdominal pain, shove a tube up her rear before it can get away. And test anyone else with stomach pain.",If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
Everyone else is dead.,Not Everyone. The one thing the donor gave to each of these people is his DNA. Anyone else have his DNA?,"Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me."
You want to do a colonoscopy on a healthy four-year-old?,"She has a tummy ache. If Kutner's right, it's not a tummy ache, it's a fatal brain or heart or lung or liver or pancreas ache.",Nobody cares. Do you know how long its been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
I'm not gonna scare the hell out of the poor kid's mom because of a long shot corollary to a long shot theory.,Fine. Tell her the truth. Then ask if daddy knows who the real daddy is.,"Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but thats my issue, not yours."

shouting back Not until you learn to read. to House You're supposed to trust friends.,I don't know the guy. I got no logical reason,The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
To be his friend? Have you nEver seen an after-school special? That is part of the pleasure of friendship trusting without absolute evidence and then being rewarded for that trust.,You're taking pictures of a guy who's having an affair with his own sister. And you're lecturing me about the rewards of trust.,"I dont understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?"
"There are two types of people that hire me. No, actually, there are three types of people that hire me, but the third type's irrelevant to the point I want to make.",Do you have a special rate plan for being a pain in the ass?,"One, two.. Didnt say three, did I?"
One type wants to find out that they're right. One type wants to find out that they're wrong.,Which type am I?,Are they right?
You're the third type.,You lead with the irrelevant types?,"Yeah, I know the type."
You're the type that doesn't care if you're right or wrong because they've hired me to investigate the wrong person.,That's an actual type?,"No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong."
You want me to check out Wilson. You want to find out if he's,How do you know about Wilson?,"Well, bigshot, If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes."
What do I do for a living?,You checking me out? Have I been paying for that?,"God, what am I doing with my life?"
"So far, you haven't paid for anything. You want to find out he's pining. You want to find out if there's something about him that will tell you he's gonna come back or something you can use to make him come back.","House thinks, then looks away as he asks Is there?",You should probably just meander back there take a look.
"No, no, there's nothing. Sorry. long pause That will be $900.",I gotta go. I'll get you a check.,"Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars."
Colonoscopy was clean.,Then that just leaves cancer.,I dont need anything at the Galleria.
The fact that the kid's colonoscopy was negative doesn't prove anything.,"Yes, the fact that it didn't prove anything didn't prove anything. Excellent point.",Your sister sits by the side of the King.
The opening would have to be open shortly before death.,"Unfortunately, we can't know when shortly before death is until shortly after death. And that seems like an obstacle.","Thatll be a neat trick, when youre, when youre dead!"
What if there was a way around that?,Then we're kind of all sweating over nothing.,I could manage my way around that.
It's not gonna,Do it.,I dont think this is gonna work.
What if it is autoimmune?,What if we don't have conversations we've already had?,"Alright everybody, you are doing great!"
We don't have time to dismiss things we've already dismissed. Nothing fits.,"See, that's an example of a conversation we've already had. She's sick. Something fits.","See, this is exactly what we do not have time for."
Something fits. MS?,"exasperated No! Okay, from now on, no one says anything unless no one's said it before.",Wait. I dont think yours will fit me.
Where are you going?,You guys start immuno-gels on her CSF to look for hidden protein markers.,What if I told you theres a huge ticket up right behind you?
Treatment for what?,Cancer.,"All right, everyone calm down!"
It's not cancer. Chemo's toxic.,It's something. Which means we should treat her for something.,"Rust, is boat cancer, Ross."
It's something. Which means we should treat her for something.,She's fine. Where's her chart?,But it is something.
You rang emergency to get her chart?,I know.,Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go?
You found cancer?,No.,"Oh, they found her?"
Then you have tests indicating,Nope.,You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow.
Then why should I sign it?,That's a good question.,"Well, Im not signing away my rights."
So you do have proof that it's cancer but you can't tell me because it might affect the way I react to the medicine?,"If that were true, and it would certainly make sense, do you think I could tell you that it's true? enormous wink. She signs.",I hope I get to work with you someday again.

The world was ugly. You think the world would be any different if your leg was fine?,No.,"Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?"
"Think you'd be any different if your leg was fine? I mean, the doctors told me that my life was gonna be so much better once I could see. I would date, I would dance, but, uh, the guys I hated dancing with before I hate dancing with after. My parents were still dead. I was still alone.",You're fun.,Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent.
You don't seem all that different.,I haven't given up. He leaves.,Notice anything different about me?
"Wilson's got a new job, hasn't started yet, but",So who are we following?,What is he doing now?

"No, I'm following the one halfway in between that point and that point.",House focuses on the target with his cane. Pretty. Who hired you?,I didnt see where it started but I saw where it ended.
No one. I just like her.,You're stalking her?,"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monicas mom..."

"Well, then you stay four feet behind me.",How do you know what they're talking about?,"Okay. Okay, you dont have to walk behind me any more."
I'm in the same grief counseling group. I recently lost my mother.,You'd get laid more often if you told them you lost a kid.,"Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesnt it?"
I didn't lose a kid.,You're a PI who can't lie?,And he lived.

"Oh, you've nEver come up.",In the grief counseling or in the other,Hey! What happened to you? Why didnt you come up?

"No, we don't. Better is better. Who cares why?",I do. And so does Tetrault.,But what if it is better than ours?
And so does Tetrault. Who?,The dead tuba player.,He does? Who is it?
The dead tuba player. Tibalt.,"The point is, he died last, but he died. Which means she's gonna die too.","Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. Whats that piece of tape?"
Tibalt wasn't receiving cancer medication.,There's a cancer drug that's used off-label for arthritis.,"Yes. He wasnt, though, was he?"
There's no record of arthritis.,Did you interview all the tuba students?,Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
"If he had joint pain in his hands, he couldn't have played.",Then it wasn't in his hands.,Maybe we shouldnt play due to the circumstances.

This makes no sense.,"I know. She's dead unless we can find what's cancer... but not cancer. They all think, silently. Something's missing.","What Im about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing Ive ever said."

That's not the way it works.,"You have a way of thinking about things. It's sloppy, it's undisciplined, it's not very linear. It complements mine. It drives me down avenues that I wouldn't otherwise",Hey. Ooh! Dont sit down!

"No, you won't. She's crashing!","on intercom from observation area You might want to check her IV. From here, it looks like saline instead of chemo.","Okay, will you just go help her change please!"

"Cut the crap, House.",Your wife has a separate bank account in her name only. She's been making weekly cash deposits for about a year now. No withdrawals! yet.,Are you funny?
That's it? A bank account?,A secret bank account.,Is it a secret bank account?
What makes you think it's a secret?,"Because if it wasn't, you'd call it the bank account.",What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
"Damn. Always forget to use the right article when lying. It's not secret. We're refurnishing. We set the budget, set up an account. I just couldn't make it to the bank the day we opened it.","You're spending almost $100,000 on furniture?","Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay?"
He said you told him he was better. What's happening? What's wrong with him?,She is hot.,Hes miserable! What happened to him?
She is hot.,Obviously the drugs weren't out of his system.,"Oh, yeah. Shes hot."
"None of these drugs, nor the drugs that they're derived from, are known for causing seizures.","By themselves, no. But three unproven, untested drugs? It's like the mod squad. No one could stop them.","Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them."
Ridiculous that they let people take potentially dangerous drugs for money.,"Just to short-circuit that discussion, people should not be testing drugs because they're desperate.","Yeah, I dont understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us."
"Ergo, welfare kills sick Parkldren. First drug",Why don't we call it bisexidrine?,"No, youre right, Pam, lets just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it."
"Bisexidrine is designed as an anticoagulant. Phase one indiCated some risk of nausea, ED and insomnia. Second drug.",Cuckoldisol.,Some exciting new antianxiety drugs.
She is having an affair?,Worse. Sex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional. Can be easily regretted. Money is always a calculated decision.,"Yeah, no. Shes not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here."
My wife has her own bank account that House doesn't think I know about.,Shocking. Discuss.,"All right, my turn."
Which is the third drug?,"Worldssorestkneesisil. Kutner smiles Cuddy used to have that title, by the way.","Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Exlax?"
"There's a million ways these drugs could interact if they're doing what they're supposed to. If they're not, two million.","And it'd be interesting to know which of those interactions was causing the pRoblem. Unfortunately, we don't have to. We just have to stop the interacting.","Okay, Sheldon, Im going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive."
If we don't know which,Stop them all. Put him on dialysis. Clear out his system.,How would we know that?
"Rapid detox risks arrhythmia, another seizure, hepatic failure.","Difference is, we know what those risks are. Put him on dialysis.","I think after this, Ill be dead."
You were right about the dialysis. He made it through the night without any more seizures or visual symptoms.,And I am going to be just as right after breakfast up in my office.,"Alright, uh...alright. Im gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat."
"You can screw with me all you want at work, but stay out of my personal life.",What did she say?,"I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but its hard, when you."
Did you just hear what I said?,I heard the part about you can screw with me at work all you want.Want my advice?,"I didnt inherit Littlefingers spies along with his position, Im afraid."
Of course not.,"Good, 'cause I have no idea what you should do. I only know what you're going to do. You're gonna",It wasnt that bad.
I said I didn't want your advice.,I said this is not advice.,I thought I made it clear to you thered be no need to speak to me on this matter.
What purpose could that possibly serve?,None. Which is why I'm not saying you should. But you will.,So what was it for anyway?
What's your end game?,Where are you?,Whats the second part of your plan?
in the clinic waiting area At the track.,"That's, like, six miles away. How cool are these things?","In the womens bathroom, above the sink."
I feel like an idiot. The Woman sitting next to him shifts further away. I'm not giving you any more of my stuff.,You have those night vision goggles?,"So move along, give me my chair and there wont be no more trouble."
You have those night vision goggles? No.,You're lying.,"No, you have such beautiful eyes."
You like making him miserable. You like driving people away from you.,He deserved to know the truth.,"I dont want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him."
There was no truth until you dug it up.,"You do know that stuff exists Even when you can't see it, right?",I dont even know what the truth is anymore.
whispering It was a truth that mattered to him and a truth that mattered to her. Why did it matter to you?,"First of all, stop saying a truth. There is only one truth.",A piece of info that she know that I had.
That may be true for you.,leaving the elevator and talking loudly Miserable people save more lives.,"Yeah, I guess thats true."
"Yeah, that makes sense.",Usually I have more of a fight on that one.,Why isnt this bothering you?
So why are you making Taub miserable?,I just said!,Why are you doing this to Andy?
Could be his immune system's on hyperdrive. Cytokine storm.,studying papers in front of him Why would you pay for a three-year gym membership and only go twice?,"Oh, I cant believe you called her fat."
"He just completed a total dialysis. If it was the drugs, he'd be better.",Or he'd be worse. pause I take it none of you saw Trainspotting.,Cause I know what youre trying to pull here.
You think swelling is a symptom of withdrawal?,You think it's a coincidence that three new symptoms cropped up as soon as we took him off the drugs?,"Sorry, Michael, I dont think theyre real."
It's possible some of the symptoms,"fiddling with pill bottle Either the drugs are the answer, or the drugs are a coincidence.",No. Im being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
So how do we do it?,Hair of the drug that bit him.,How could we do what?
"That's ridiculous. If it is the drugs, they're dangerous, and they've already caused","That's why we're gonna put him back on the drugs, and then wean him off again. Just much slower. The fellows look at Foreman. Why are you looking at him?","You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, youd double their price."
Try it out.,You heard the boss! Go!,Give it a whirl.
You heard the boss! Go!,Taub,"No, no, that was my boss."
Drugs could have set off a dorMant neurological condition.,"Good point. Coming clean can cause a lot of damage. Alienation, divorce.",I think its best that you not know.
My wife's buying me a car.,I was talking about the Patient.,Getting my wife a week off from work.
You were wrong.,Divorce was metaphorical.,"Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine."
What about Kluver-Bucy syndrome? Bilateral lesions in the temporal lobes. Visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality are the key symptoms.,Good thing he's got that girlfriend.,Im curious about the whole social construct.
You owe me an apology. Any rationalization you had for meddling in my private life disappeared when she had good reason,"You're right. Fact is, nothing I said applies. You had no reason to forgive her. Therefore, no reason to seek forgiveness. No reason to be an idiot.","Okay. Thank you! Thank you! BecauseIm sorry, all right. Because yknow what? She didnt want menot important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision."
Kluver-Bucy wouldn't explain the seizure or the cytokine storm. Withdrawal complications.,"Then again, she is handing you a giant gift that you don't think you deserve.","Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?"
The damage can be a circulatory issue rather than structural. We wouldn't see that on the MRI.,Foreman's right.,"Thats funny, the damage doesnt look as bad from out here."
Odd that a Man who can't run would own so Many pairs of sneakers.,hands Lucas his jacket You wanna hang this up when you're done?,"Ah, come on, sneakers are easy."
I have to find something embarrassing about you.,"No, you don't.",I know all that.
"I ordered us Indian. Not too embarrassing, just something credible.","getting beer from the refrigerator Well, if you hand her that, she's not gonna need you anymore.","Oh, I wish Id know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese."
"Well, if I don't hand her anything, she'll think I'm incompetent.",I don't care if she thinks you're incompetent.,Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
This isn't gonna work.,It's worked so far.,You know what?
"No, I'm no good at lying.",I know. That's why your cover is that you want to do her. takes Vicodin,I.. I.. I need a good lie.
I like her. I don't wanna do her.,Then what's the point of liking her?,No no no no.
I meant I don't just want to do her. I like her. What do you think you're gonna find out about her?,Something! personal. Something embarrassing. I spend half my life negotiating with that Woman. Anything I can use to scare her into saying yes.,"Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me."
Anything I can use to scare her into saying yes. Okay.,Okay? You're okay with being paid twice to facilitate blackmail?,I dont want to do that.
"Here it is. Circle of Willis, the vessels are narrow.","Narrow for you, normal for him. If there were pRoblems with the vessels, he'd have had symptoms long ago.",What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
Not if something else changed.,Like?,"No. Were throwing out the entire playbook, were starting from scratch, were implementing a brand new system."
His heart. He could have recently gotten an intermittent arrhythmia.,"I know heart and head start with the same three letters, but you gotta read all the way to the end.","Theres no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?"
"The experimental drug is causing arrhythmia, which causes low blood pressure. Combine that with those narrow vessels, the brain doesn't get enough blood. That causes all of his symptoms. If we can trigger the arrhythmia and identify it, we might be able to stop it from killing him.",Been home?,"Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. Hes not a lord."
Been home? No.,Good. Do an EP study. Find the arrhythmia.,Are you just getting home?
"How long you plan on keeping me from going home? Until you're convinced I'm a different person, one who won't do anything stupid?","Guilt fades quickly. By Wednesday, you'll be fine.","Once youre safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
Right ventricle. And why do you want it to fade? Why do you suddenly care about my marriage?,Because! if it ain't broke,"Its left sweetie, but thats okay sweetie, thats a tough one."
You obviously think it is broke.,You obviously think it ain't.,I think this thing is broken.

"Going again, charging to 120.",Have you been dyeing your hair? He's inspecting Brandon's temples.,"Im sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue."
"No. House, clear.",Right. steps back,No... cleaning... up.
steps back Ow.,The hair is growing in red.,Step back and shut your mouth.
His heart rate is stabilized.,to Taub Does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color? Either he's lying about dyeing! or just dying.,"So she looks at me right, and she goes, Im sorry, dont I even know you?"
to Taub Does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color? Either he's lying about dyeing! or just dying.,Red hair means it's not Kluver-Bucy. Melanin affects hair color. What affects melanin?,"But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover."
Hormone panels were all normal. Age.,He's turning prematurely crimson?,It was before my growth spurt.
A genetic disorder. Waardenburg syndrome causes arrhythmias and can change hair color.,And make you deaf. Next.,"Yes, Chandler, thats exactly what it is."
Found a long QT interval. I think it's RoMano-Ward syndrome.,Explains the irregular heart rhythms.,"Ya know, I just, so weird."
Explains the irregular heart rhythms.,But not the ginger nut.,"All right, hows this for revenge?"
"If he's got RoMano's, he's got at least five gene mutations. Not a big leap to think he has others that would give him the hair.",It also gives him the likelihood of sudden and unexpected death.,"He sometimes wears glasses, write that down."
Beta blockers don't work. His heart can't handle an ICD.,Pete Best.,What are you doing here?
"Pete Best was actually a great drummer, but I assume you mean the Patient needs a cardiac sympathectomy?","PRobably should have just said that, huh?","Oh, hes playing organ for a childrens rollerskating party."
"Start cutting nerves, you risk his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating.",So he saves a fortune on karaoke maParknes and deodorant.,I told you to put tape on his mouth.
You think he's stable enough for surgery?,"If he was, he wouldn't need it.",You must be very proud of your son.
"This isn't progressing. It's there, then it's not, then it is. It's a new symptom, intermittence.",It's irrelevant. He's pacing and the other two follow him.,Im going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isnt so overwhelming.
Since when is a new symptom irrelevant?,Since it points towards the same disease. Intermittence can fit with RoMano-Ward. We still need to do a sympathectomy.,Oh.. I dont know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
Maybe we missed something. Toxins.,"When? When you checked Every bottle, Every can, Every tube of paint? Or when you detoxed him twice?","I know! Its like Im being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!"
He's lost weight since he got here.,That's a symptom of trying to cram hospital food down a throat he can barely get air down.,I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here.
"It's not a symptom, but what if the toxins were stored in his fat cells a year ago, and now they're being released into his bloodstream?",So where you gonna get this old paint? City dump?,This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
On his old paintings. We know he hasn't sold one in ages. But there weren't Many in his studio. He's hid them somewhere.,"If you're wrong, he could drop dead from RoMano-Ward at any moment. You okay with that?","Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around."
Just give me a few hours.,You got one.,"Uh, just give us a few minutes."
"It's not the paint, it's the drugs.",He's not on the drugs. He sits down.,Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
"I know it doesn't make sense, but I'm looking at his paintings for the last six months. They're normal April, June, and August. But they're distorted May, July, September. He shines a light on a different painting as he names the month each was painted. Every other month, he was having visual agnosia, because Every other month he was on all three drugs simultaneously. The statin was one month on, one month off. I don't know why the symptoms keep coming and going, but it is the drugs.",They're hiding under the stairs.,He painted that.
In the fat? That doesn't make sense. These drugs aren't fat soluble.,"I said stairs, not closet. What was the last drug he was on before the drugs he was on when the symptoms started?","Oh. You got me again. This isnt nonfat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me."
I'm not sure. I think,Antacid.,Im not sure.
How do you know?,"It makes sense. Also, I'm looking at the file.","Howard? Uhoh. Make room, Visigoths. Sup?"
She didn't buy it.,Damn. So you didn't get anything.,She bought it?
Nothin'. We pRobably overstepped. You're really not the cheerleader type.,"On the other hand, I figured she pRobably wouldn't figure me as the photoshopping a photo and planting it in an obscure college paper type either.","Oh! Shes not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, were not married... yet!"
"Heh. Yeah, about that. I took a little trip to your alma mater.",You took a little trip 150 miles.,"Look, you and I went to different high schools."
"Online, by phone. I meant I did research. House sits and picks up a guitar. They start improvising together. That's a real photo, isn't it? no answer Wow, that is humiliating.",There was a girl.,They did it right there on the couch.
"Even more so. That's too bad. You wanted her to see you in a different light, and! not only didn't she see it! She didn't Even beliEve it was possible.","You know, people hate people who have theories about people.","Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her."
You want me to back off?,Would you?,"Why should I back off, you back off dude."
Are you okay?,I picked Cameron's pocket down in ER. I came up with a doozy.,"All right, hurry up and close the door so they cant hear us."
Your mother called twice.,"She's still healthy. This 25-year-old Woman, on the other hand!","Oh yeah, like you never called!"
Her messages sounded kind of urgent.,"Well, that's the way women sound when their spouse of 50 years dies. He goes into his office, hanging his cane from the top of the doorframe as he enters.","Yknow, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didnt get her messages yet."
Your dad died? Are you,Yep.,"Of course, my grandfather died when I was five."
"House, call your mom.","What are you, my mom?",Pennys apartment. Knock on door.
We can continue this differential in five minutes.,"Are those bags under your eyes? You were up all night. You told her, didn't you?",Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.
"I don't know what your daddy issues are, but don't deflect them on me.",to the others Told his wife he's been getting some strange. She kicked his adulterous tuchus to the curb.,"Well, I like to think I take mostly after you."
"Anybody read Parknese? Otherwise, we have no idea what these doctors did to her.","Kutner, you're sort of Asian, right? Get it translated.","No, I umm, I read about her in Moms suicide note."
"What about Meckel's diverticulum? If the surgeons didn't remove the diverticulum, it can cause pain, bleeding.",Too high up for a colonoscopy. CT could miss it. Ultrasound's fastest. And since I'm fastest with the ultrasound!,"And Harrenhal, I suppose thats off the table as well."
"House, let me do the ultrasound. You need to deal with your dad and stop","I'm not deflecting because I'm avoiding something deep. I'm deflecting because I'm avoiding something shallow. Seriously, I'm fine. I didn't Even like the Man.","Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, Im gonna go talk to mom for a while."
"I'm not deflecting because I'm avoiding something deep. I'm deflecting because I'm avoiding something shallow. Seriously, I'm fine. I didn't Even like the Man.",No Meckel's. He hands her a box of tissues. Were you there for the rice or the reeducation camps?,And youre frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
I was there to track down my biological parents.,"Like a salmon returning to the stream where it was born. Did you become whole again, or did you get eaten by bears?","Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard."
They denied my existence.,"Four parents, and not one of them taught you to cover your mouth.",But you told them you werent?
"Doctor, we're her parents.",I'm just a technician. Her doctors will be by later. You can schmooze then.,"Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary."

quietly They were treating her for! very quietly SARS?,"Not very effectively. But SARS explains the cough, causes hypoperfusion, which explains the ischemic bowel. It's perfect.","Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?"
Lung involvement isn't very sEvere.,"getting on elevator Okay, well, so call it ARS. Start her on ribavirin and interferon.",How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.

I'm doing this for your mom.,I'm not doing this at all.,I would do it for my mother.
"I'm not doing this at all. If there were something to be done, I would have done it in the year he spent dying. He checks his pockets. You took my Vicodin? I'm in pain. Wilson pulls the Vicodin bottle from his inside pocket, opens it and gives House a pill, all without looking at him. One? So the Vicodin is my leash. One'll take the edge off, but it won't give me enough relief for an escape back to Plainsboro. He swallows it.",Where's my phone? Wilson ignores him. It's the team. It's their ring tone. nothing Forget it. The Patient's blood is on your hands.,"Okay, what if he buys his own desk?"
House? You there?,I'm being held against my will. Call the police!,Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.

"Give me my cane, I'll go to the damn funeral.",I said I'd go to the funeral. I didn't say when.,"Sweetie, are you sure you dont want to come with us to the funeral?"

So he was a bastard. He was still your father. You're biologically programmed to have feelings for him.,"No, I'm not.",I didnt even know he was my father until after he was dead.
Feelings aren't rational. I know you have trouble with anything that can't be quantified and counted.,He's not my biological father. Wilson looks at him. I figured it out when I was 12.,"Im just saying, you pretend you dont, but you have feelings just like everybody else."
"Of course. You were a brilliant, socially isolated 12-year-old, and you create a parallel universe in which your life doesn't suck.","I look at the facts. First of all, he was deployed on training exercises off Okinawa during the time I had to be conceived.","No, just because Im living my life like it was 12 years ago doesnt mean Im delusional."
"And since you're 150 years old, air travel was impossible.",His second toe is longer than his big toe. Mine isn't.,My father wouldnt send you.

I think we may need to call House again.,You lost track of your speed? I think that was Hitler's excuse. Lost track of the Jews. No one held him responsible.,"Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith."
"I'm not playing, House.",You were protecting me. Anybody in their right mind would have ratted me out.,"I dont want to play a game, Sheldon."
I'm just trying to speed things along. You are going to this funeral.,Make it fast. I don't want to miss the anal cavity search.,Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?

Large cyst. Something going on there?,"Wilson's getting arrested. How large? SUV sized, or mid-range sedan?","Okay, can someone please tell me whats going on here?"

I'm sure there's other smart doctors.,You'd be surprised.,No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
to House You told me you'd taken care of this.,I did.,Lets just say I took care of it.
First words you Ever said to me.,I took care of it. You must've screwed up somehow.,You know thats the first time you ever said that you love me.
It's a really old warrant. Isn't there a statute of limitations on this kind of thing?,It's suspended when you flee the state.,No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
I was fresh out of med school. I didn't know anybody at the convention.,"You heard the Man, Wilson. You don't have to explain.","Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was."

"So I I asked the Man to stop, politely.","Yeah, you yelled politely.","If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh."
"I was polite the first couple of times, but courtesy made no impression on this ass. So I threw a bottle into the mirror, which successfully conveyed my message.",And smashed a ten-foot antique mirror. And set an example to two other patrons who threw shot glasses.,"Excuse me. Okay, Ill be honest with you. Ive just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized youre a human being Im a human being. I could just say to you"
I think I have the picture. I assume you're the guy who was playing the song.,"No, I was the guy who bailed him out.","Sure, he was in your band?"
"This guy was a total stranger to you, and you bailed him out?",It was a boring convention. Had to have somebody to drink with.,You stopped and got him takeout?
"And there's the foundation of our entire friendship. If you hadn't been bored one weekend, it wouldn't Even exist.","Hey, there were 3,000 people at that convention. You were the one I thought wasn't boring. That says something.",But then you and I had some time together.
It also says something that you lied to me about getting the charges dropped!,I got a Lawyer. He cut a deal. You didn't call the guy? You have to show up at the arraignment. Everybody knows that.,Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me.
reading a fax You can go.,What? He he's a fugitive from justice. That whole story was lies. He stabbed a Man.,"Fax, why dont you just send it over on a dinosaur?"
unlocking the handcuffs Louisiana doesn't want to pay to get you back.,Forget Louisiana. He was driving recklessly through your comatose village. Do they put lead in the jelly doughnuts here?,"Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already?"
They're not now. It's not the gallstones.,"Well, of course it's not gallstones. Who thought it was gallstones?","Umm, yeah, uhhuh, theyre implanted."
You said steamroller.,I also said construction site.,"That was your choice, not mine."
Gallstones could cause a pancreatic cyst.,"to Wilson Will you just turn around. The thing is two hours over already, and that's the third time we passed that colonial with the cross burning out front.","Oh, the Huntsman is good."
I'm not lost.,I'm not talking about what caused the cyst. I'm talking about what the cyst caused. Everything.,"No, Im lost too, I think she skipped a step."
"Cysts are symptoms, not diagnoses.","Unless it's a multiple cyst, with connections to other organs! like a steamroller.",That is not what I said.
Chase isn't gonna go groping around when she's got kidney failure. Bubbles.,Is that your new stripper name?,She already likes soap bubbles more than us.
"Yes. And also, we inject bubbles into the cyst and follow where they drift. If they end up in the other organs, we know you're right, cut it out, she's fine.",Bubbles is right. Go echo. He hangs up.,I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
"I'm so glad you're here. Oh, it's a load off of my mind just to see you. She hugs House. Thank you, James.","Mom, how could you delay the funeral?",Thanks Rachel. Andand dont forget youyou can come visit her anytime you want.
"Honey, your dad is dead. He's not going to care. Do you know what you're going to say?",I don't know. Just let the minister or one of his buddies from the corps!,"Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care."
"The lord is my shepherd, I shall not want!",quietly to Wilson I am not talking We were strangers who shared some geography 30 years ago.,"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do."
"Right, he had no influence on you at all. The father who was compulsive about punctuality.",His issue. Which I deliberately made not my issue.,Our father was more of a father.
"Thereby making it your issue. Compulsively showing up four hours late, ignoring discipline, ignoring rules.","looking around Oh, God, he's here.",That is an excellent question.
"Who's here? looks The one you're pretending is your father? Nice pick. He looks like Sean Connery. So back when you were devising this fantasy, did you tell your father Dad, I refuse to recognize your existence because I have chosen James Bond as my dad?",I used different words.,"Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing?"
What? Hearing that your own son hates you so much he's replaced you in his mind? That's gotta suck. How did he take it?,I already told you. He didn't speak to me for a summer.,"I cant relate to that, my son hates my guts."
"at the podium It means more to me than than I can say to have all of you here today. And now, uh, our son Gregory would like to say a few words. House doesn't move. Greg?",There's a lot of people here today.,"If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence."
"There's a lot of people here today. Including some from the corps. And I notice that Every one of them is either my father's rank or higher. And that doesn't surprise me. Because, if the test of a Man is how he treats those he has power over, it was a test my father failed. Wilson looks embarrassed. Blythe looks worried. This Man you're eager to pay homage to, he was incapable of admitting any point of view but his own. He punished failure, and he did not accept anything less than",He loved doing what he did.,Your father was an honorable man.
Put it back.,"Well, he's not gonna miss it.",Turn it over.
I'm done enabling. You can't Even let them put him in the ground without making it serve your agenda?,You really want to do this in front of Everybody? You wanna punish me or them?,You hate these fanatics as much as we do.
"How can I still feel surprise? You would take, Even this, a moment of real huMan grief, and turn it into a farce.","Oh, cut the crap. You enjoy what I do. I nEver had to force you. You like coming along for the ride.","Uh, nope. Nope. This isnt the surprise. Its surprising, um... because you didnt expect it. But you will... youll know it when you see it."
"Yes, that's why I'm cheering you on now.",This is about you needing to be prepared for the worst.,"And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"
Don't bring Amber into this.,"And you weren't ready. That makes you angry. The world sucks, and you didn't have time to brace yourself.","All right. Hey Rach, while youre in there, throw something on Alicia Mae."
What happened out there is your show!,You're scared to death of losing anyone that matters. So you dump the person who matters the most to you!,"Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?"
I'm not scared to death. I'm moving forward!,Because no one can take away from you what you no longer have.,"Well, I dont think there is anything to do."
"Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. Your father's death is about you. Amber's death is about you. I can't imagine why someone wouldn't want to be your friend!","Admit it, you're angry and you're scared of losing me.","When I lost my own father, I didnt have any friends to help me through it."
"I'm not angry, I'm not scared.",Admit it.,Im not trembling.
I'm not afraid.,Admit it.,Im not worried.
I've lost people. It happens.,Admit it. Admit it!,"What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?"
"What are you, five? Stop repeating","Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Come on, admit it. Admit it!",Its only one colour.
"Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Come on, admit it. Admit it!",Still not boring.,I cant believe you wont just admit it!
Did you know I was gonna do that? Because I didn't know I was gonna do that.,I know you have trouble losing people.,Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna
"So I peeked at the return address. Diamond, Fairbairn.",Divorce attorneys. Your first wife had just served you with papers.,"Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address."
Did you know that when you bailed me out? Were you! doing something nice for me?,What did I say about being boring? He picks up his phone and starts dialing.,"Yknow what? Youre right, Im sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely."
Hello? It's House. turns on speakerphone,How'd the bubble test go?,Oh the phone!
House is thinking House?,The images aren't grainy.,"Howard, you know were saving up for a house."
They sure look grainy.,I've seen pictures of you where you look tall.,They are awfully boxy.
Atrial myxoma is more likely.,MRI for a better view. And call me back and tell me you're embarrassed because my eyesight is better 500 miles away. I need a phone number.,"Come on, come home with us and tomorrow Ill, Ill take you to Legoland."
MRI for a better view. And call me back and tell me you're embarrassed because my eyesight is better 500 miles away. I need a phone number.,"I'm a doctor in New Jersey, treating one of your clients. A young Woman looking for her biological parents.","Hi! Yeah, Im calling on behalf of Monica Gellers eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. Hes out of town, but does she want to see the oncall doctor?"
"You know, you could just wait for the MRI to have your curiosity satisfied.",What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?,"You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh."
What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?,"Did the parents look tan? The disease she has is genetic, which means they should have it too.","Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody."
They don't look more tan than anyone else.,Discolored teeth?,"I know, but look at me all tan."
They're farmers the village doesn't Even have a dentist.,Right. Thanks.,Little village people.
"But if it matters, I'm not convinced they were her parents.",Why not?,"Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so."
"Because they said they have no daughter. The Man was adaMant, and the Woman seemed confused and frightened.",Thank you. He hangs up and turns to Wilson. Differential. Say you're a middle-aged Parknese Woman!,"Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?"
Say you're a middle-aged Parknese Woman! Fine.,Say it.,Im not gonna date a 55yearold woman.
I'm a middle-aged Parknese Woman.,"Girl comes to you, says that she's your long-lost daughter. Why would you be frightened?",Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type marsupial.
I'm frightened because she's a threat? Maybe she knows something?,She hasn't seen you since she was an infant.,Youre afraid of her.
Maybe an inheritance issue.,They're peasants.,Perhaps theres some arrangement?
Her very presence is a threat. She what year was she born?,'83.,Its not? When was she born?
She's not supposed to be alive. Parkna introduced the one-Parkld policy in 1979. Say they didn't want a girl. They tried to kill her.,Maybe the baby doesn't die. Maybe the father panics or regrets it. Takes the baby to an orphanage. Maybe he doesn't tell his wife.,"Hey, buddy. Hows my favorite dog, huh? Hows my favorite dog? Youre subdued. Did you give him a beer?"
Who freaks out like she's seen a ghost 25 years later when the girl shows up.,Why does attempted murder from 25 years ago suddenly become relevant to her health now?,Why would the little girl creep you out?
Maybe they gave her something toxic. It would have to be fat-soluble.,"This is fun, isn't it?","Woah, hey, yo."
"This is fun, isn't it?",Let me see the MRI.,"Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?"
She started vomiting as soon as we started the scan.,Then let her vomit through the MRI.,Im trying to save you from yourself!
I already had this conversation with Wilson just go with it. Poison?,Buddha wouldn't make it worse.,"Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke."
"Maybe the weight stressed her back, which",Makes sense if she's nEver lifted anything in her life.,"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath!"
She actually didn't get sick till she tried lifting it that second time. I'm guessing the weight changed.,epiphany Anybody have Taub's pager number?,hmmmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
epiphany Anybody have Taub's pager number? What's up?,"Maybe give him a call. If he tosses that switch on the MRI, she's dead. X-ray her brain.","Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?"
"Maybe give him a call. If he tosses that switch on the MRI, she's dead. X-ray her brain.","Pins. Push them through the soft fontanelle of an infant, you skewer the brain, and the hair hides the entry wounds. It's the perfect crime.","Ha! See, I knew, I knew youd get it on the first guess. Isnt it cool! Its an apothecary table."
What changed at the temple?,Same thing that changed in the MRI.,I meant a Hindu temple.
I hear your Patient's gonna be all right.,Is that why you're here? A colleague checking up on a Patient?,"So yknow Ross its funny cause, you look familiar to me too."
Something goin' on?,"I'm celebrating. He hands Wilson a sheet of paper from his desk. Wilson looks at it, then back at House. My mom hated him too.","Hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want."
"Your DNA test showed no match? That's incredible. At the age of 12, you actually figured out your father wasn't your birth father? That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Why should it depress you?",It doesn't depress me. Doesn't make any difference at all. That's what depresses me.,"I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know."
"Well, I guess nobody gets to choose who their parents are. I'm not Even sure anymore if we get to choose who our friends are. pause I spoke with Cuddy. She hasn't filled my position yet.",If you're coming back just because you're attracted to the shine of my neediness! Wilson smiles slightly I'd be okay with that.,"I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose."
"I'm coming back because you're right. That strange, annoying trip we just took was the most fun I've had since Amber died.",You hungry? Wilson nods. House gets up and they head for the door. House stops. Wilson.,"And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back."
Wilson. Yeah?,My dad's dead.,What about Lee Meriwether?
I don't know. House.,putting up a finger to stop her Eh.,The box says kitchen.
walking toward him I have a case I think you might be interested in.,turning quickly and heading out of his office Not now.,Aye. Ill take you to him.
A 26-year-old Woman had a tonic clonic seizure.,What about me speeding away says to you let's chat?,Lets get out of here.
"History of fatigue, and two years ago she had a retinal vein occlusion.",She's diabetic.,"Thats a bit childish, isnt it?"
"No, she's not. And she has no history of hypertension. She holds out the file to House, which he ignores",approaParkng Wilson's office It can wait.,Actually were out of the lobster ravioli.
approaParkng Wilson's office It can wait.,I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.,"Youve reached Senator Robert Lipton, please leave a message."
I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.,"Oh, my goodness. I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured.","Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, its in the diaper bag."
"Oh, my goodness. I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured.",I wish I had learned this valuable lesson earlier. I was waiting by my window for an hour. Why are you late?,"Well, its a long story, but umm I broke Joeys chair"
I had a breakfast meeting at Mickey's Diner with the Mercy people to tell them! Wilson sees a donut on a plate and a carton of milk behind the bookshelf I'm coming back to work here. He pulls the plate and the milk toward himself Sorry if it interfered with your plan to maim me. pause Donut's a nice touch. He takes a bite of the donut,turning and opening the door to leave It's my way of saying welcome back. House leaves. Cameron is still waiting in the hallway,"I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Merediths life by hitting her, with my car."
The seizure could be the result of dehydration or something neurological. She holds out the file again which House takes this time,looking at the file Or the ecstasy you found in her system.,"So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?"
"According to Dr. Hadley, the Patient took the drugs about five hours before the seizure, so!",obviously curious What does Thirteen know about it?,What is wrong with you?
"Uh, apparently she was with the Patient last night.",looking at the file again At 300 AM? Cameron shrugs,And where is she this evening?
looking at the file again At 300 AM? Cameron shrugs,"lecherously Oh, yeah! PentHouse forum meets medical mystery. Maybe there is a God. He heads back to his office","Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five."
"lecherously Oh, yeah! PentHouse forum meets medical mystery. Maybe there is a God. He heads back to his office",Empty transient sex?,"Oh, dear Lord."
Not diagnostically relevant.,Depends what we're trying to diagnose. It's how steep of a spiral you're on.,Not a good idea.
Also not diagnostically relevant. Retinal vein occlusion was fixed. Her doctor said it was a venous anomaly.,Is he in this room?,"Oh, thats nice."
She parties till 300 AM. That's why she's always tired.,Yet you seem fine.,"Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening."
Makes sense. Bone marrow's in overdrive. Too Many platelets. to Thirteen Sorry.,"Thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis. And no, that one wasn't a metaphor. Suck out some marrow. That one was.","Dwight! Stop it! Can you help me please, Im being crushed."
"Thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis. And no, that one wasn't a metaphor. Suck out some marrow. That one was.",I like to watch. He follows her out the door,"Heres one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like Id never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord."
I can handle this alone.,"You've already handled it. That's why you need a chaperone. Of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone. So feel free to ignore me.",Maybe its the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
"You've already handled it. That's why you need a chaperone. Of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone. So feel free to ignore me.","You know, if you're in the mood to start kissing, or groping, or showering.","Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?"
You're Dr. House?,I assume my name came up last night in the form of a moan.,"so I talked to the scout, it looks good."
"WhatEver you think we did, we we did. And then some.",Lights on or off?,"Well yknow, we did other stuff too."
Do you have a medical rationalization for that one?,Light sensitivity.,Schrute. Mister Schrute.
Light sensitivity. On.,"Figured she had more shame than that. Did she talk dirty, or did you rely on vague hand signals? House is writing something on a clipboard","Oh! I see what happened. Its because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, youd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
"She's, uh, pretty direct about what she wants.",I'm learning so much.,"Oh, she does want to."
I'm learning so much.,"Okay, score the score. Scale of one to ten.",I am learning so much from you.
wincing from the pain SEven.,holding up a piece of paper with a large number 7 written on it Finally got one right. Thirteen looks thoroughly disgusted,"Well, you know what, its kind of hard for me to talk about it."
You want to investigate him because he ate a donut?,He claimed he had a morning meeting at Mickey's Diner.,I think I left a donut up here.
What do you think you'll find out?,"I'm worried that he might be, a spy.",to investigate the crime scene.
He's been gone four months. You're worried the friendship has changed.,I'm just not sure if he's working for Hirohito or the New England Patriots.,"Ahh, oh thats OK, I mean, hes probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff."
You played a practical joke on him. He didn't laugh.,"I need something to lord over him, a lie","Umm, he said he thought I was funny."
He didn't try to retaliate. He moralized.,He always moralized.,Retaliation. Tit for tit.
He always moralized and got Even. He hasn't fired back.,Things always change.,Thats it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
And that sucks.,Yeah. Find out where he was. House gets up and leaves,"Oh yeah, that sounds great."
We had to use paddles to stabilize the Patient's heart.,"Eye issue, brain issue, now a heart issue. Sounds like a real case to me.","My God, when hes on the table and they use the paddles on him."
"Yeah, I get it. I was wrong. Can we move on?","You're just upset! Because the whole time she was with you, she was thinking of my huge, thRobbing! Diagnostic skills. Drugs would explain Everything.","Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous."
"This morning, you rejected drugs.",That's when I thought that Thirteen was right and was just jerking her around. Cardiac arrest means she could be a serious user.,"Yeah, uh, I just, I figured Id get that first relapse out of the way."
"That means that something she did at my place set this off. Either she brought drugs in, or she grabbed something from my medicine cabinet. And that means my place needs to be searched. Now, I'd be happy to do that myself, but unfortunately that would be far less titillating for House, so he's about to come up with some convoluted medical reason why I have to stay here while he goes through my stuff.",Patient's dad had bypass surgery. Means she's a candidate for atherosclerosis. She needs an ultrasound. That was much less convoluted than what you just said.,Shes enjoying living with you and she didnt want it to end early.
"I'm not giving you my keys. If you want to do this, I'm going.",Who could pick a lock?,"Okay, Im gonna need to search your car."
I'll go. Make sure he doesn't steal any underwear.,You're a disgrace to your stereotype. Move over.,All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
Think you can pick a lock faster than me?,No need to pick. House shows Foreman a key and uses it to unlock the door,When did you learn how to pick locks?
Nice. Steal from your employees.,NEver. I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.,Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
NEver. I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.,Always imagined she'd have a sex swing in the living room.,You hired your husband a hooker?
Give me my key.,Don't have your key.,I have a copy of your key.
You expect me to beliEve that you hired Lucas to investigate Everyone except for me?,Waste of money.,Do you think that after what you did to Han were going to trust you?
I already know Everything about you.,pointing with his cane Thirteen had her purse. That's gotta be the Patient's. Check it for drugs. I call shotgun on the bedroom.,"I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me."
You know that I stole a car when I was a teenager. You know that my mom has Alzheimer's. You know nothing else. Foreman has put on latex gloves and is searParkng the purse,Want me to have you investigated? When did you get so needy?,Theres a security guard coming by.
Purse is clean.,Last night wasn't the first time that Thirteen brought home some strange.,"Im sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?"
You found her diary,No toys.,Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
"No toys. You sleep with the same person over and over, that's when you need accessories. First time is plenty exciting on its own. He takes something from the drawer Unless!",You think an asthma inhaler could be used as a sex toy? He gets up of the bed and gives the inhaler a squirt,"Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?"
There are ways of getting to know people without committing felonies.,People interest me. Conversations don't.,By stalking them?
both are smiling Like Thirteen.,to Thirteen Brown recluse. Found it at your apartment. Their venom can cause seizures and heart pRoblems. Unless the ultrasound showed anything,He killed his king.
No. What room did you find it in?,"Bathroom. Nice bidet, by the way. Very refreshing.","No I left it on my night table your night table, by the lamp."
I don't have a bidet.,Oh. Spider's not the only interesting thing I found. He pulls the inhaler out of his jacket pocket,Does that mean theres no toilet paper in the bathroom?
You moved? Who cares?,He doesn't.,Damnit!! Did you move?!
Spider bite doesn't explain anything unless the Patient was actually bitten by a spider. He stands up I'll do the exam.,Don't be ridiculous. That would be inappropriate. It'd be better if a Woman gropes her. There's no sexual tension that way. Thirteen stands to go do the exam,No dont tear out your eyes!
"Blood test confirms low potassium lEvels. Explains the numbness in her hip. It's not good, but I think we've got time for at least one or two comments about my personal life.",Which you just wasted with that comment about my comments. Low potassium means her heart pRoblem was a symptom of a kidney pRoblem. What caused the kidney pRoblem?,"I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage."
Could be IgA nephropathy.,Not without blood in the urine.,Make it stop!
Not without blood in the urine. PSAGN?,Not with normal blood pressure.,"No, I dont think its possible."
"Renal tubular acidosis. Her kidney's don't filter acid out of the blood. Excess acid drives down potassium, causes kidney calcifications.","If it's RTA, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications.","Yeah, I think I know what youre talking about."
"If it's RTA, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications. CT her kidneys. If you find calcifications, we have our diagnosis. House continues on down the corridor, Thirteen heads back to Spencer's room",What's he doing now?,"Okay, so what is solder?"
He's playing that carjacking video game. He'd get a lot farther if he didn't stop at all the red lights.,Maybe he was doing something he thinks I'll mock him for.,"Theres Andy, hes in his car."
Maybe he was doing something he thinks I'll mock him for. Like!,Just about anything.,"Maybe he found you, um, a bit much."
You don't think it's that.,I don't think it's just about anything?,I dont think that this is
"You don't think it's about anything trivial. If you weren't worried, you wouldn't be sitting in my car.",Maybe he's seeing a shrink.,Then why are you talking?
Maybe he's seeing a shrink.,Doesn't matter if it isn't.,Maybe hes going to church.
The breathing pRoblem started after we fixed her kidney pRoblem. Means the RTA isn't the underlying cause.,Where's Thirteen?,"Oh, the springtime thinks that its the best."
Traffic's bad. She's pRobably just,Not here.,Because youre in the right lane behind a bus and you wont go around it?
"It's not her lungs. No masses, no infiltrates.","Her lungs are working, but she still can't breathe.",The bll is drrbing!
That could signal autoimmune or some kind of dystrophy as the underlying cause.,There's only one way to find out if her airway failed.,Im the hell person whose office this is!
Just spoke to my brother.,"And by brother, you mean?",My brother is dead.
I mean my parents' other son.,Wow. Same dad.,He shares no blood with me.
"Got a call last week from your PI. You lied. You did have me investigated. You've been taunting the team with what you've learned, but you nEver came after me. grinning Means you couldn't find anything.",You're right.,"I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it."
grinning Means you couldn't find anything. You're right.,"That's because you haven't done anything stupid, spontaneous, or Even vaguely interesting since you were 17. And that's just sad. The elevator door closes",You saw the ship sail away?
to House I found her in the clinic giving herself IV fluids.,At least you could've let her finish. She looks terrible.,She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
She has a fresh nightclub stamp on her wrist. She's in no condition to practice.,"Unless this is a prelude to an actual spanking, there's no reason for me to be","She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?"
But I can suspend you until you do.,to Cuddy Because she went to a nightclub in her free time?,"What? What do you mean, suspend me?"
"to Cuddy Because she went to a nightclub in her free time? Or because she had sex in her free time? Patient was undergoing routine surgery for RTA. Didn't need Thirteen here for that. And I don't need you making my employees punch a clock or pee in a cup. to Thirteen, nodding his head toward the door. Let's go. Thirteen hesitates",opening the door Come on. Cuddy looks stunned,"Fifteens the point, the point is fifteen."
as they walk into the clinic area Thank you.,"By the way, they stop the surgery was not routine, Patient stopped breathing and you missed a differential. You're fired.","Youre welcome, oh, youre going to step right, okay, Ill."
What? You just defended me.,"No, I just prEvented you from getting a drug test. PRobably saved your career. I'm already taking responsibility for one doctor with a drug habit. He pops a Vicodin","All right, Ill stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
I don't have a drug habit.,The slutty party girl is fun till she pukes on your shoes. Then she's just a pain in the ass. He leaves Thirteen looking confused,"Why? When I look in the mirror, I dont like the face that looks back."
The slutty party girl is fun till she pukes on your shoes. Then she's just a pain in the ass. He leaves Thirteen looking confused,I haven't sat on this couch for four months. It remembers my cheeks. I miss this.,"I missed most of the party Charlies a girl, right?"
Me too. Me trying to work. You interrupting.,"Oh, come on. Your Patients can wait five minutes. Get me caught up. Come on, what did you do? Travel? Did you get a new hobby? Did you meet someone?","Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, Im stuck at the office all day."
"Actually, yes. I sort of, started, dating someone.",Great. What does she do? Is she! an actress?,"Well, have you been involved with someone where you havent broken up?"
No. Why would you think that?,I just figured you'd want something a little more! Exciting!,"No, but maybe the reason"
"She's not! You're gonna find out anyway because you're gonna meet her. She's! a prostitute. Used to be. She made some mistakes. Single mom, had some drug issues. But! she's so smart.

"I know this is awkward, but we need to talk.",There's a reason that we've evolved a feeling of awkwardness. It tells us not to talk about things.,"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first."
I was emotional because of the adoption falling through. And you actually let your huMan side show for a moment. That is why we kissed. I just want to say thank you for not! taking advantage.,"You're welcome. Any time you want to stop kissing, I'm there for you.","Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever."

He can Chase me out once he's done doubling up in agony.,"to Stewart WhatEver your big pRoblem is, it's caused a complication we call colon FOS.","Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, thats also why I chose you as a roommate."
I made my wishes clear.,"Uh-huh, and if the crazy fairy were here, she could grant them.","I was giving clear, concise orders."
I'm not insane. I I feel pain when I go outside. So it it's rational to avoid that pain.,Except now you're feeling pain inside.,Then youre insane.
We can give him drugs for the blockage.,"And if it doesn't work? That blockage will rupture your intestines, spew sewage throughout your body. WhatEver you're scared of out there, aren't you more scared of death?","Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing."

What's going on between you and Cuddy?,Bad lovin' gone bad.,"What is up with you two, Holly?"
Seriously. Why didn't you argue with her? She just threw us off the case.,Because ignoring her is a lot easier.,You heard her.
It's like the red badge of idiocy.,"If the confederacy had mosquitoes, we'd all have southern accents and I'd be paying Foreman less.","However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak."

"No, she always chastises you. And you'd always come running to me to complain. So you're acting different too. You're scared. You are scared to get involved.",How is that scary? It's rational. Emotionally mature people who work together should not date. Guaranteed breakup. Guaranteed ugliness.,"Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why dont you say something?"
"Any relationship that doesn't end in a breakup ends in death. Everything falls apart in the end. That's your worldview. The corollary, which you keep forgetting, is that you have to grab any chance for happiness.",Why does this matter so much to you? Cuddy and I are fine. The only person getting worked up here is you.,"Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face."
I don't want you to be fine. I want you to be happy. I think if you dated her,Are you familiar with the adverb vicariously?,Im not fine.
If I wanted to ask her out,You did ask her out. Last year. WhatEver happened there?,I just asked that girl out.
I don't know. I wasn't interested.,Wrong.,"I, I dont know."
"Wrong. You were interested. But Amber grabbed your genitals first. But now you're single, and that makes you miserable because you think it's too soon for another relationship. So you're gonna make me miserable. Please, get a girlfriend, or a life, or something. For me.",Better or worse?,"You know what, Michael?"
Worse. Drugs aren't working. I think we should do the surgery in his House like we planned.,"Well, then one of us wasn't paying attention because I thought that surgery thing was just a trick.",Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
We prepared the room. We hung the drapes. It's pRobably ten times as sterile as any mobile operating theater you'd find in a battlefield.,We still need Trapper John.,"You mean cause this room isnt supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?"
Chase doesn't want anywhere near this surgery. Maybe you could talk to him.,I can't understand a word he says.,And Gertie cant stop crying.
I can't understand a word he says.,Taub. Doing anything later?,Does he understand what were saying?
"I will. And in fact I've nEver done this before because I went to med school, not nurse school.","to the Lawyer Hey, wanna see if your client's actually made of money?",Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?

Little bleeder here. Cautering.,"Hey, wait. The gas","Fine. And heres my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasnt bled yet. Clearly you dont have the patience for all that."
"Hey, wait. The gas",to the Lawyer That always happens during surgery.,"Before I come in, you should know, I have gas."
We should run a blood test for celiac.,Not fast enough. Not accurate enough. He stops tossing the ball Force-feed him wheat then do an endoscopy as it hits his duodenum. See if there's an allergic reaction.,"Hey, Pam, Im assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him."
"So is the blood test, which is painless.","Foreman, listen to that little voice in your head that's coming from the telephone. speaking directly into his cell phone on the desk Force-feed him.","David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse."
I'm guessing that's a new technique.,"Hey, you remember that idea that Cameron had about trying to torture the Patient into admitting himself?","You know, most people dont realize this technique has actually been around for a few years."
Pretty sure it was your idea. You want me to slow down the test?,"Wow. Everyone's got all these great ideas today. pause So you're thinking Patient won't leave because leaving causes pain, so we gotta make staying more painful. That actually makes sense.",What? Youre okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
"You'll increase his pain, but not enough to make a difference. He's on morphine.","He's on morphine now. Pretty soon he'll be on less-phine. 'Cause when you restock, you'll actually be giving Cameron IV bags of saline.","Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam."
And why do you think I'll be doing this?,Same reason you did the surgery.,And where are you going?
That was because it was an emergency.,No.,"Oh, thats ridiculous."
looking over his shoulder at House She's having me sleep on the couch. Just for a few nights. I'm not doing this to save my job. I'm doing this to save his life.,looking back at Taub Right. That's what we'll tell Everyone.,"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job."

"Yeah, she's a little nuts. But she's beautiful, smart, funny, and most important, she can stand you.","Yeah. I came here to have you lecture me on Cuddy, not because there's a killer mosquito chasing me around my apartment.","Yeah. Shes really funny, and shes warm. And shes just... well, anyway."
"House, there is no mosquito. This is all about Cuddy.","Ah, she's bugging me. Poetic.","I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily."
Have you seen this bug?,pointing to his hand Have you seen this bite?,Youve seen one of these?
No. What I've seen is a suppurating wound that you've scratched and mutilated into a gangrenous state. Delusional parasitosis.,I am not imagining things.,STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?

"No, you're not afraid of authority. You're afraid she actually is right for you. You're afraid to take a chance because it's too big a chance. If it doesn't work with her, then maybe there's no one out there.","I am not rationalizing. I'm better off alone. Also, you seen her ass recently?",You will. Youre thinking too much.

He hangs his coat on the coatrack,"Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, its actually extremely plausible."
She's an eMancipated minor.,"In a factory? Either an Olympic gymnast who busted her leg, a Parkld star who blew all her sequel money on drugs, or she's just a lying runaway.","Yeah, if shes old enough to get married, shes old enough to follow the law."

Kutner can do the echo on his own.,Yes! But he'll be very lonely. So I have to ask why?,"Yeah, he does, but its not the same."
I've been asked to help run a clinical trial. That okay with you?,Good for your career. Great for your street cred. What's in it for me?,Why do we have to do something together?
You have four doctors and nEver more than one case. It means I have time to work on other things. And they'll have more chances to step up.

Didn't you just say it's not?,Not all heart damage has to be structural. Drugs could have caused intermittent tachycardia. He gets up,Its not. Things would be easier if it were.
She builds her own furniture. You think she skips work because she's feeling a little weak? She needs steroids.,"Steroids could cause an irregular heartbeat, making her current one irregular-er-er.","Like she basically has a hobby, for a job."
We started her on haloperidol. She's stable. Lab tests showed the delirium wasn't caused by a metabolic pRoblem. Means we still don't know what caused it.,"popping the Vicodin Yeah, we do. Nice job, Foreman.",She died when I was little.
I didn't switch her meds.,But your decision to stick it to the Man clearly inspired Oliver Twist. He picks up a water bottle from the table and takes a drink,Nah. everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
I treated her based on the symptoms she presented.,"You treated her based on empathetic orphan syndrome, and almost killed her in the process.",So I have a flaw!

And is not based on wishful thinking that she's safe and happy?,Im now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mindhunt break and look for a heart or some in the break room when youre through.
And is not based on wishful thinking that she's safe and happy? Prinzmetal angina.,Silent and unhappy is better than vocal and unhelpful.,"Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein."
No reason it couldn't cause an artery in the brain to spasm. Leads to the delirium and the pulmonary edema.,"Foreman, give her ergonovine to cause vasospasms, and run an fMRI to see which artery's dancing.","Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however"
"No signs of spasm, impeded blood flow, or brain dysfunction. It's not Prinzmetal's. All the fMRI showed is House was right. She was lying.",Only relevant if it can cause pulmonary edema and delirium.,I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts.
"We find out our Patient's been raped, and that's your response?",Is she a psych Patient?,How do you want to handle it?
Rape could mean STD.,Thank goodness one of you doesn't have a heart.,"Im not going to rape her, Im going to fuck her."

She lied about dead parents because it's better than rapist parents. You find that unsympathetic?,That's it.,But still her father.
That's it. What's it?,Her whole life's a mess. What rhymes with mess?,"Yeah, yeah, what is it?"
"It's not stress. She has none of the usual Manifestations. No hormone imbalance, no cardiac","Yeah, she's drowning in her own lungs, and she's delirious.",You bought a crib without me?

It was killing her.,"But since she's still dying, the arsenic obviously wasn't killing her.","Oh, but its made her so happy."

I'm okay with that.,"No, you're not. You are designed to have opinions and to force them on people.",Im okay with the logic of it.
"It's her life. Point wasn't I'm dying. Point was she should live. You should have told her. Instead you tell her to call the cops, give her stats on DNA markers. Everything's by the book.

That was her explanation.,That makes sense. How long did it take her to come up with that?,Does that include Thats What She Said?
It was her immediate reaction.,That doesn't make sense.,"She saw that, huh?"
The fact that it makes sense doesn't make sense?,Emotional is immediate. She went to rational first. Means there was no emotional to process.,"Oh no, now its not gonna make any sense!"

Her BP's fine.,I know.,"Yeah, she tops out at 130."
Exercise-induced asthma actually fits.,I know. You know. She can't know.,"Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out."
The only good way to test for EIA is to recreate the conditions in which the attack occurred. But we can't exactly make her run out in the cold on a broken ankle.,"Get creative.

You said forget the,Tssss. Dr. Thirteen has the floor.,"Yeah, lets just forget it."
Bypass could create malabsorption issues. Leads to low potassium.,Very stupid. Her potassium's fine.,"Well, if you dont."

He's at the sink with the tap turned on. It floats.,What else floats in water?,"Um, wheres the shower?"
What else floats in water?,Looks like I was wrong to dismiss apnea. You guys can stay up all night gloating in the sleep lab. He drops the glove on the bucket and leaves.,Hes not gonna make it.

I don't think replacing that was part of the renovation plans.,"It is now. Lucky for us, we can treat all those toxins with the same thing chelation.",Thats what I said when we moved it.
The chelation didn't work. Her muscles are still deteriorating.,That rules out toxins. So what else can go wrong when the Hindenburg deflates?,"Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as youre up, we could talk."
Why aren't we doing this in your office?,Obviously because it would be stupid to do this in an office with no furniture. Cuddy! overreacted to my overreaction.,Because were not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.

"Superficially, I loved it. But deep down, I think I was miserable. Why? What's going on?",You weren't miserable. You gave something away to make a relationship work. You rationalize that you're getting something back.,"All I know is, it wasnt the way I dreamed it would be."
"Okay, I'm gonna go get Cuddy's approval for the brain biopsy.",Leave 'em there. I'm gonna do the biopsy myself. He leaves.,"Um, Im gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care."

Could be lymphoma.,Not with normal LDH.,None of you will get it.
ITP fits. We should start her on methotrexate.,"Absolutely, and total body irradiation.",Youre a dentist.
"TBI will promote cancers, kill her digestive tract.","Don't forget, stop her from bleeding into her brain.",Really? Thats so cool. Ive always wanted to learn...
"It's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal.",True.,You have little regard for your own life.
True. Must be somebody's job to stop me from being reckless and irresponsible. He gets in the elevator. Nobody can stop me from being premature. He chortles goofily as the doors close on him.,Got a Patient with ITP. Need to hit her with radiation.,"Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?"
to person on the phone I'm gonna have to call you back. to House Methotrexate.,"Good point. On the other hand, if she bleeds in her brain, she's gonna need a Special Ed class of her own.","She got the way to move me, honey."
"On the other hand, if she bleeds in her brain, she's gonna need a Special Ed class of her own. Fine.",Really?,"A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an exmodel, and now she wants to do something with her brain?"
"Yeah, if you think it's right, do it.","Hmmm. Some people thought you were gonna be brutal, marking your territory.","No, because thats the right thing to do."
"Some people thought you were gonna be brutal, marking your territory. Who?",Nobody. Just because I call him nobody doesn't make me a racist.,"In case you remember, I was defending my honor."
"I'm not gonna play games. If you come to me with a request and it makes medical sense, I'll say yes.",I need oral sex. I'm pretty sure biological imperative qualifies as medical sense.,"No. Hey... I mean, although its just for fun, you know we want... I was counting on you man."
Can I return my phone call now?,I don't really see how that's gonna be possible.,"You know, can I call you back?"
Patient won't respond to methotrexate. Bleeding time hasn't improved.,You have a medical dilemma for me. I have one for you. I need a reason to not do total body irradiation.,We havent decided on anything yet.
Other than that Cameron said you can't.,She said I can.,"No, you cant."
Then why don't we just do it?,"Because it's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal.","Oh, do we?"
Then why don't we just don't do it?,Because that would let Cameron in on the fact that I nEver intended to do it.,Why dont we talk more about it instead of doing it?
"This is gonna be convoluted, isn't it?","I figured I'd ask for something really crazy, so she'd shoot me down and get the whole I can control House thing out of her perky little system.","Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?"
Unless we irradiate her. Without the radiation. We book the nuclear lab. We fill out the paperwork. We bring the Patient down there. We do Everything but flip the switch.,Go. Do. Don't flip.,Like everybody elses.
"And is there anything we should be doing, you know, to actually help the Patient?","Trust me. In the long term, this'll help all our Patients. In the short term, double the dose of methotrexate and add prednisone.","Oh my God, who died on this?"
"The Patient said she had to go pee. Maybe when she got up, she started to urinate. Increased the vagal tone, caused arrhythmia, and stopped her heart.",Who has to go pee in the middle of a nuclear procedure?,"Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?"
It wasn't really a nuclear procedure.,She didn't know that. The others look at him. People don't die from peeing.,Going into nuclear something thats not where the scene was going.
Like the classroom with the broken heater and the cold metal table in the procedure room.,"Oh, for God's sake, get a room. Immerse her in an ice bath. The cold will activate her cold agglutinins.",And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so.
Causing her heart to race.,Confirming our diagnosis.,He could temper her worst impulses.
And giving her another heart attack.,"Lucky for me, there's a flaxen-haired maiden who loves to say yes.",And dumping her on her birthday.
You hired me to do this job. Let me do it.,"Oh, I'm sorry.","If thats my job, then so be it."
"If you're gonna wait, you can wait outside.","Unless the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to dump the baby, because she hates the baby and thinks she made a big mistake.","So what, like people are gonna come in and think, Uhoh, Im outside again?"
It's not a big deal. I was having a bad day.,Is Wilson gonna be in trouble?,"Its alright, its no big deal."
For betraying my trust in a vulnerable time? No. Why would that bother me?,"He was worried, made a bad choice.",Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.
You saying I should give her back?,Much better than having a mother who doesn't give a crap.,And I have to give it to her?
What did you want?,We got a green light. Go draw the Patient's blood.,Dude! I put that thing on my face!
Go draw the Patient's blood. Why?,To see if it clumps in the cold.,"Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin Jake?"
She's making you confirm your theory before you treat?,She approved the bath. Just thought we ought to do a test to confirm.,Cool. Cause she says youre doing a great job as weird friend who doesnt have to be at every appointment.
I think she was playing you.,getting on the elevator Go draw the blood.,She suckered you too.
You come to procedures now?,Only the ones that might involve stopping the Patient's heart.,I imagine youre familiar with the procedure.
Cameron tell you to be here?,Shut up.,Is Joey here?
"He was extremely sensitive to touch, yet he had a! a tactile fascination with newspaper. I mean, he wouldn't read it. He would just! just touch it, crinkle it. I thought maybe that was a way in. Papier mch and! and it was. He let me into his world.",Please tell her that talking will ruin the test.,"No, that was my way of telling you."
"All the kids I try to become a part of them, and then have them become a part of me.",How much longer till the heart attack?,Do you love your children?
"I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was eight years old. NEver wanted to be a pediatrician, though.",Now they're both talking.,When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials.
It's not cold agglutinins.,I'm not surprised. She obviously has brain damage. Taub looks at him. Seriously.,"Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?"
"She screwed up a room number six years ago, and you decide she has brain damage?",Transposed digits. Classic marker for number confusion. Means she has a lesion in her left parahippocampal region.,"Yeah! She is cool, and shes so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious . Thats not how she used it...?"
I misdialed a phone number this morning. Must be contagious.,She also forgot to pee before your fake test.,I had sex today.
So she has a small bladder.,Shows an inability to predict the future.,"Oh, so thats how it works?"
"Also loCated in the left hemisphere of the brain, close to the parahippocampal region.",Means the damage is ongoing.,"No, no, no, no, I dont think thats where it was."
"Two subtle clues, six years apart. That's hardly compelling evidence.",I'm compelled.,"A little obvious, perhaps."
"That's not what this is. Every time a decent person comes in, you set out to prove that they have brain damage.",I nEver said her deranged personality was a symptom.,"I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when youre being dishonest so I can see what lights up."
You don't need to. I've been here five years. I can hear your thoughts from my apartment.,Can you hear me now?,"No, you dont have to, and you cant because I, I live here too."
Move onto another organ.,I did.,"Starve, most likely."
The screwed up numbers and forgetting to pee points to her being a huMan being. The platelet dysfunction and cardiac arrest points to a pancreatic tumor.,Or multiple sclerosis.,"Well, I hope youre still committed because Im pregnant."
Or we could not cut into her brain. It's just her pancreas. We should do an ERCP.,"Well, we could settle this with rock, paper, scissors, but, unfortunately, there are people who adjudiCate these disputes.","Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay?"
A pancreatic tumor is much more likely to kill her.,"Not this week, not next week, not next month.","Okay, its fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, whos got ya excited?"
The number confusions six years ago. You don't think we have time for an ERCP?,"The heart attack was six hours ago. Now, maybe it's planning to go into hiding for a couple years, or maybe it's gonna hit her lungs.","Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have? Im sorry, that was a little abrupt."
Stop! We have to assume it's the brain.,I'll go fire up the biopsy drill.,"Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain."
"No, we had to assume it's the brain until we prove otherwise. Do an MRI, T-2 images.",You want me to do another test?,"Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters."
"You should be able to see the MS plaques. If they exist, you can do your biopsy.",No.,"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didnt you?"
"Even magnified images of her hippocampal region, nothing.",This is surprising.,"Im tellin you, she leaned back, I could see her brain."
So can we cancel the biopsy?,Go ahead with the ERCP.,"You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults?"
I need to talk to you about Remy.,Who?,"So, I uhm."
Who? Thirteen.,What did you call her?,"When I was 13, I"
She's on placebo.,And you want to change that.,Oh my God.
"Or I respect your opinion, and I want to hear what comes to your mind.",Has she invited any of her lesbian friends into bed with you?,Id like your honest opinion on something.
I was mistaken. He starts to leave.,Drug gonna cure her?,"Yes, yes I actually saw him leave."
"turning back It looks promising, reducing symptoms.",No cure then.,And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
"The question is, are those few years worth risking the rest of your life in medicine? No.","There, that wasn't so hard, was it?","I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD."
"There, that wasn't so hard, was it? Thank you.","You're welcome. Foreman turns to leave again. Unless you love her. Foreman turns and stares at House. If you love her, then you do stupid things.",And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
"The surgeons were able to drain the pleural effusions. The Patient's breathing on her own, but she's still pretty weak.",Lung failure proves that one of us was right. Who said brain?,"I write erotic novels, for children."
"Yes, you predicted that her lungs would fail, but the MRI was negative for MS.","I was right about the where, but not the what.","Uh no, theyre still here but I think Im about to leave."
Are you talking about cutting into her skull?,"Actually, I'm talking about cutting off her skull, exposing her brain.","Chopping off Joffreys head, you mean."
ERCP was negative.,"leaning over to hold Thirteen's hands And she agrees with me because she agrees with me, right, sweetie?","Though if you did, its more zeroes than youre expecting."
All we need is a more sensitive test. Endoscopic ultrasound.,turning and grabbing one of Kutner's hands in both of his Just accept that you've been proven wrong.,"Yeah, this has happened before."
adding his other hand to the pile You were also proven wrong. Why don't I get a second test?,"Because if I'm right about the brain, then we don't have time to indulge your wrongness.","Uhhuh. Prove it. Lets see your penis. I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong."
getting up to leave Let me know when Cameron says yes to cutting off our Patient's skull. I'll be doing the endoscopic ultrasound.,"Good news. He comes the rest of the way in. I don't need your approval for some crazy, unproven treatment. I just need to do a test.",that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
You wanna remove your Patient's skull.,Remind me to revoke Kutner's telephone privileges.,Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
I didn't realize that was an AMA-approved treatment for MS.,"Not searParkng for MS, but what set it off equine encephalitis. Turned a cool breeze of MS into a Cat 5 storm.","I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily."
I didn't realize your Patient was a horse.,There's been huMan cases.,This isnt your horse.
Not when it's 30 degrees outside. Transmission is by mosquito.,"So she got bitten six months ago, or it's some other infection.",I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
"You're asking me to let you cut off the top of someone's head. I need more than, I'll know it when I see it.",So you want proof before you let me go looking for the proof? This is the test.,We just need a picture of the top of your head in case we burn some of your hair off.
You have to give me something.,"Cuddy's gonna love you. The Patient, on the other hand, is gonna hate you until the day she dies next week. Actually, this idiot will pRobably forgive you. He leaves.","See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when Im about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ..."
Don't worry about it. It's just the picture that came with the frame. You can chuck it.,Kid with a raging viral syndrome and three dead mosquitoes. I'm off to storm the Bastille.,"All right, hand me that other box of photos thats the very last one."
looking at a vial inside the baggie These aren't mosquitoes.,Fruit flies. Close enough.,"Yeah, well, I dont like bugs, okay?"
Acute viral nasopharyngitis? One of her students has the common cold?,"Team's not what it used to be. On the other hand, Kutner ran his endoscopic ultrasound, didn't find peep.",I do not sit on my sons war councils.
So disproving it's her pancreas proves it's her brain?,"Yes. You used to do this job, remember? That's what used to pass for evidence.",Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Now I do this job. You brought me three dead bugs and a runny nose.,I can't find you the proof you want because it's trapped inside her head.,"When I found you, I thought youd been dead for days."
What do you want me to do? Say yes just because you're House?,"I'd certainly like that, yeah.","No, I really wanna live with you!"
Cameron actually said yes?,"Nope, I'm just obsessive about clean cuticles.",Monica said that did she?
Sawing off the top of her skull and placing electrodes on her brain is insane.,"Right, we should be retesting her pancreas for the umpteenth time.","Excuse me, this whole idea is insane."
"You're skipping steps because it's Cameron. You haven't figured her out yet, and you want to see how far you can push.",I'm skipping steps because our Patient is skipping steps on the way to being dead. If you've got a better idea!,"Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, youre gonna have to try. Youll just gonna hate yourself if you dont. Oh come on answer it! Its driving me crazy!"
"We should remove her spleen. Splenic lymphoma explains the damaged platelets, the heart, the lungs.","If this doesn't work, the spleen's all yours. He heads into the OR Unless I kill her, of course.","Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy."
"If this doesn't work, the spleen's all yours. He heads into the OR Unless I kill her, of course.","Not only will this allow us to clock your brain's processing speed, you'll also get free cable for the first three months.","There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready."
A blue car. Is that part of the test?,"Nope, my lease is up next month.","Well, that is probably from the test drive."
"I'd nod yes, but I can't move my head.",showing another flash card This pen is red. Its ink is red. Is all ink red?,"For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no."
Cameron's letting him cut into our Patient's skull based on nothing but dead bugs and someone else's runny nose.,"There are two pints in a quart, four quarts in a gallon. How Many pints in five gallons?","What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopuss mind in SpiderMans body?"
"to Rachel Okay, all right.","That's my old boss. loudly And by old, I don't mean former.",oh... hi.. goes to Rachel with open arms
Insulting me is not gonna make me go away.,You're not here. Obviously I'm not trying to make you go away. He holds up another flashcard. Hint the answer is a number.,We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me.
Is she serious?,"Well, she's certainly not funny. Put the phone down. Pick up the baby. Make us all happy.","She is kidding, but dont ever disagree with her again."
I can BP's dropping.,Get it back up. I got a whole stack of these.,"You know I can, my man."
"Oh, that is so annoying. Can you make it stop?",Baby's crying is annoying you? to Cameron What's her nerve conduction?,"Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is."
14.3. It's actually speeding up. But her BP's 80 over palp. We're gonna have to stop.,That doesn't make any sense.,"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down."
"Please, turn that phone off!","Why does the baby annoy you, but no one else does? I mean, you're right about her, but",No. Please dont use my cell phone ever again.
Can't dose her with anesthesia till the last batch completely clears.,How come the baby annoyed her?,That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
Her blood pressure's in the tank. I hope she lasts two hours.,What was different? Our Patient loves all things annoying.,Because not everybody knows about the party.
She'd love this conversation.,"She's an earth mother, takes in the freaks and rejects of huManity and tells them they're a-okay. So what was different?","Well, I dont think she wants to talk to anyone right now."
"Her head was open, you were asking her questions, a baby was crying.","She had low blood pressure. According to the laws of physics, low blood pressure causes light-headedness, chest pain, but not annoyance.","Did she think you were choking or Im sorry, thats great."
Move your feet.,You decided to keep her. Thank you for telling me. You can go now.,People think youre pulling the kings strings.
I talked to her. We connected.,You talked at her. You had a chemical reaction.,Wed like to speak with her.
Are you trying to annoy me?,I'm trying to explain you.,Are you laughing at me?
"I know it doesn't make any sense, but it was real. It was there. You want to hold her? to Rachel Come here. Come say hi.",taking the baby You think we'll bond?,"Rachel, how did this happen?"
taking the baby You think we'll bond?,Is that cute?,So youre going to give me the baby?
Is that cute? A little.,"If I threw up on you, you'd be pissed.",Thats kind of adorable.
Your puke isn't as cute.,That's 'cause of your hips.,"Well, maybe a little."
Plenty of people live perfectly normal lives without,entering Spleen's fine.,"You, how can you say that?"
It's not her brain.,Of course it's her brain.,You got all that from the back of her head?
You looked at her brain. You took off her skull. You found nothing.,Didn't look in the right part.,Keep looking. What do you see?
She has a patent ductus arteriosis.,"When you get stressed, your blood pressure goes up and forces open the ductus.",Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
"I know gas is expensive, but I could've given you a ride.",Elevator's broken.,You could have offered me a ride home.
"Dana Miller, the cancer researcher. Spontaneous pneumothorax.",Awfully thin file.,Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
She just got admitted.,Lots of things can cause pneumothorax. Why don't we let eight or ten other doctors rule out the boring stuff?,"Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?"
We wanna take this case. She's maybe five or ten years away from curing retinoblastoma.,popping what looks like more than one Vicodin pill Which would make this case attractive to anyone who has some vested interest in people curing the incurable.,"If she doesnt think that we should apply for this patent, shes being patently absurd."
We have a case?,Did you just get to work?,We got a problem?
Am I in trouble?,Did you take the elevators up?,"Come on, help me out."
"to House So, steroids for asthma?",Yeah. Do a CT looking for hyperinflation to confirm. The team files out,"No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypoallergenics."
Come here. Look at this. Come here.,Adorable. Elevators keep crashing. Is Mercury in retrograde or what?,"Come here. Okay, be right back."
Elevators can be capricious. Sometimes it just seems like they're out to get you. She keeps playing with the blanket. Why would she do that?,walking back around to the front of the desk Why do you think the elevators would be out to get me?,In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door.
"I don't know. Maybe they wanted to take time off to spend with their little dumbwaiter. But then they had to leave it at home with an elevator sitter, because you drove the replacement elevator to quitting because, you're incapable of listening to anybody but me. That's just a theory.",You're wrong. I don't Even listen to you. Either do your job or go home. Leave me out of it.,"Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft."
I am gonna do my job. It doesn't mean I have to do it happily. Doesn't mean I have to do it without resentment. And it definitely doesn't mean I have to do it without seeking vengeance on the person making me be here. Congratulations. You've officially dragged me down to your lEvel.,Okay.,I will do my job to the best of my abilities.
You've officially dragged me down to your lEvel. Okay.,"to the custodian Hey, Blue.",This is the level youre stooping to.
"Well, then, why are you a doctor? Why aren't you sitting by a pool in Fiji knocking back mai tais?",People act in their own self-interests. You're all here because you're happy to be here. Or at least because it's your best option.,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
I'm here because I want to help people.,"No, you're here because it makes you feel good to help people.",We were sent here to help out.
So... you're happy to be here?,Does it show?,"So, so youre here too?"
Could be pulmonary fibrosis.,Do a biopsy.,What kind of business are you in.
You said that would be stupid.,Does she know? Because Jonas Salk would not approve.,"No, I said your idea was stupid."
Your belly's full of blood.,"First her lung deflates, like me after a cold shower. Now her liver starts to bleed, like me after",I showed him some card tricks.
"Now her liver starts to bleed, like me after You okay?",Great. Just practicing my clown college audition.,"Yeah, great. Um, Ill put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom."
We were in the GRC.,"Lung, liver, go.",Sometimes we were.
Shouldn't you be obsessing over who did this to you?,Nope anybody bother MRIing our Patient's liver for tumors?,"Come on, dont be mad."
"If you're not obsessing, you must have already figured it out.",Yes. So I'm obsessing about why you're not obsessing about why our Patient's liver suddenly sprang a leak.,"You dont need to know, you dont deserve to know, and you will never know."
"There's a tiny spot on the caudate lobe. Could be a granuloma. He hands the MRI scan to House Erodes into the hepatic artery, causes the bleed.",looking at the scan What caused the granuloma?,"Hollys coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party."
"Blastomycosis. Could have been asymptomatic for months. It hits her lungs, we give her steroids. It blossoms and attacks her liver.","Get a piece of her lung, stick it under a black light.

"Get a piece of her lung, stick it under a black light. If it glows, sick Parkldren who need her souffls can breathe easier.",Foreman.,Oh! Thats disgusting. Thats barely healed.
Foreman. Again?,sitting down behind his desk You have a pRoblem.,"Andrew, if you say no one more time, youre fired."
"I told you, I didn't",Then you really have a pRoblem. The way she turned her head to look at the MRI... I think she's losing her peripheral vision.,"Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods."
Because she turned her head?,I'm happy for you.,You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head!
I hear Cuddy's SEAL training finally came in handy. Should I be investing in a flak jacket?,You're safe.,Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
"No carpet bombing? No burning of Dresden to teach her a lesson? Well, since you're incapable of taking the high road, I assume there's some deeper, more long-term strategy in effect.","Cuddy's not playing games. She's not looking for lEverage. She wants pure, unadulterated vengeance.","Well, she didnt execute me, so thats a promising start."
And your counter-move is to let her have it?,The only time to strike back is when I want something.,"Dont do that, youve got gold here."
"Yeah, that makes sense too.",Too?,"Yeah, yeah, that, too."
"I was thinking you actually feel guilty about taking her away from her baby. But your explanation's good too. It's completely inconsistent with your character, but whatEver.","Oh, thank you, rationalization Man. You have saved the village. You wanna eat? He gets down off the exam table","I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you."
picking up the file from the exam table You forgot your file. He sees the name on the file Dana Miller? The cancer researcher?,Not anymore. House opens the door and exits,"No, Mom, its the same guy Ive been going out with for the past two years."
"I did a free flap closure to avoid any scarring. She was lucky the scratParkng didn't cause any brain damage. But the first thing she said when we woke her up was, It still itches. He sits down beside Kutner","Itch receptors are only in the top two layers of skin. Which means she's not actually itchy, she just thinks she is.","Doesnt look happy, so Im guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon."
"Why do you have to quit to do it? If I want to do something, I do it. If you can figure out a balance, there's no burnout.","Thanks for the lesson, Deepak. The itParkng started yesterday, not eight months ago. Meningitis, encephalitis... He snaps the Vicodin bottle shut and pops a/some pill/pills","Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because somethings difficult doesnt mean that you quit."
So would a brain tumor.,"Well, how 'bout we stop guessing and MRI her head instead?","If it wanted to kill you, youd be dead."
I don't remember demoting you.,pulling a folded up magazine from his hip pocket I brought you something.,"Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced."
"grabbing the magazine from him That's just a rationalization by working moms to justify not being with their kids. Which is fine, if that's what they want. It's not what I want. looking at the magazine And this is Nurses Quarterly.",The point is,Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.

How bad is she?,Dwight why dont you tell Susan about some of your hobbies.
waiting for the elevator She's got a tumor in her optic Parkasm.,You don't need your coat to treat a tumor.,"Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. ."
I'm going to the drug company.,"To tell them that you compromised their trial, your ethics, and the Patient's health? That's a great idea.","Um, am I happy the way things turned out?"
"They have records on hundreds of Patients. I can ask them for access, find out if other Patients dEveloped tumors and how they were treated.",This drug inhibits cell death. I think I could take a wild guess at how I treat that.,"Well, its like that."
Stop taking it? Yeah. She tried that yesterday.,"Oh, my God, it's been a whole day, and her brain tumor hasn't melted away?",All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis.
"getting on the elevator I want to be able to tell her this happened to other people, and they're fine now.",So tell her.,"Okay, her apartments on the fourth floor but the elevators broken so youre going to have to oh, youre just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks."
I'm not gonna lie to her.,A little late for that.,I can promise not to tell her again.
You gonna tip Housekeeping?,looking at his watch Get it from Cuddy.,Promise me youre going to clean up.
Don't tell me she burned your apartment to the ground.,"holding his leg and sitting up Warmth would have been nice. No heat, no power.

But an aggressive spinal heMangioma could.,Go find it.,Oh yes it can.
Go find it.,You didn't answer the door.,Ill just go look for it.

"My dad was the same way about me maybe having Huntingtons, it's",Well that was your experience. Must surely apply in this situation.,"Yeah, maybe your dads right."
"Right, boy with girl genes I'm sure you're the first doctor brilliant enough to check for a uterus. He could have complications from the surgeries on his penis, that can cause pelvic pain.","Way to multitask, impress your boss and humiliate your ex. MRI's a waste of time. To continue the humiliation, go put a camera up his penis.","And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
"You're Dr. House, aren't you? What do you think is wrong with our son?","clearly surprised by their unannounced entrance These people were just coming to tell you. This is better, don't have to worry about them losing their way.","Oh, good. Okay. Dont tell me, tell them."
"We think that he has a blind uterus, he should have an MRI.",looking at Thirteen Did you send them a text?,Great. Hes pushing with his uterus.
"Over the past Thirteen years, we've eduCated ourselves.","Well, who needs med school when you've got Wi-Fi? to the team Go schedule their son for an MRI with contrast right away.","Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together."
You just said an MRI was a waste of time.,So's arguing with them.,"Yeah, my point is its a waste of time."
to House You're okay with this?,who looks bored With what?,You okay with this?
"That we're considering a diagnosis unrelated to this kid being a shemale. Assuming a coincidence like that would usually torture you, but you're completely unfazed.","Completely unfazed? You think I'm totally lacking in any fazing? The idea that I'm anything less than half-fazed, I actually find offensive. It greatly fazes me.",umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
He started testosterone,Vitamins,You used to be taller.
"continuing A few months ago. That can cause autoimmune diseases like Polyarteritis and SLE, which can cause pericardial effusion and pelvic pain. So it is related.",Now I'm unfazed. Start him on corticosteroids for the autoimmune and Finasteride to block the vitamins.,"Oh, youd think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey."
"You want us to tell a sick adolescent boy that he's really not an adolescent boy. That doesn't seem simpler to me. No, just, signing the consent form give him the meds.","So, you have pain in one arm and both your legs. Does it hurt right now?","Ah, heres the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about."
"No, its, when, I like put pressure on them. See, it hurts when I do this, with his right forefinger, he pokes himself on his upper left arm Ow, and this, pokes himself on his left thigh Ow, and this, pokes himself on his right knee Ow.",taking the Patient's right forefinger and squeezing it How about this?,"No, its a gentle kick, youre doing it wrong."
"Heart's still working that means synapsis is still firing, we just need to get a message through.",Aaahh!,"Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music."

I assume those are our Patient's lab results.","Me? Im fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, thered be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And Ill tell you something else. Ever since that poodlestuffer came along, hes been so ashamed of himself that hes been more attentive, hes been more loving... I mean, its like every days our anniversary."
The only reason you'd ignore a near death experience is you don't care or you already know why it happened.,"It's called Vicodin, I took too Many.","Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow?"
"It's called Vicodin, I took too Many.",loudly Can I please get some information about our Patient?,I am not a baby!
I don't remember you taking any Vicodin today.,I don't remember hiring my Mother. What causes the enzymes in little Boy George's existing heart pRoblem and pelvic pain?,"Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday?"
You didn't take any yesterday at breakfast either.,I don't remember having breakfast with my Mother.,"Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no."

Where are you going?,"grabbing his jacket Nowhere, I'm staying right here, so we can properly discuss this. He walks out the door",Rach! We werent gonna miss our friends getting married!

quietly to Thirteen That is sweet that you're worried about House.,"Unless the next stanza reads, Hoping to fry my brain to death, I smoked some primo crystal meth, I'm not interested.",A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door?
You can't deny that this kid may be suicidal.,We're not here to make him happy we're here to diagnose him.,Time out. You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
"Well that would certainly explain the inappropriate responses. I gotta go. Okay. to House while putting his phone back in his pocket sorry, consult.",about the drinks When did you order these?,Will he know what this is in reference to?
You off bourbon? We can get you something else.,I came here expecting a burger. Figured I'd have to endure a little lecture on moderation.,How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
You nEver listen. So why,"Instead, I get a drink a nice little serving of respiratory depressant on the day that my lungs stop working.",Of course. Ill get you a bowl of pickles.
You seem fine now.,You don't beliEve that I OD'd on Vicodin.,Im all better now.
Funny how I'm usually right.,You think that I'm on Heroin.,Right. Always right.
Well? Wanting House to prove he's not on Heroin,Goodnight. He gets up from the table and leaves,"Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?"
You should ask your parents. You idiot!,"Okay, I admit it. I have bulimia. I look good though, don't I?","Come on, Im your older brother, ask me!"
"Heroin. Heroin! House, of all the stupid",I'm not on heroin.,Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
angry I just caught you with your fingers down your throat.,I'm on methadone. Stupid product. Heroin without the high.,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?"
"Yeah, and twice the risk of death.",But no risk of arrest.,"And that would be double what now, exactly?"
You nearly died.,Today was a fluke. I nodded off.,I almost died.
"Right, you're safe as long as you nEver sleep again. Mistime your dose, you die. Couple of drinks, you die. Mix it with the wrong drugs, you die. You want to detox from Vicodin? Pick something that won't kill you.",I'm not detoxing.,Hows work going?
If you're looking for something to help with your pain,"Doesn't help my pain, it eliminates it.",Im talking about massages.
"You still breathing in there? 'Cause if not, I'm sending in janitorial.","I'm not breathing, but it's strictly voluntary. Should've seen the guy who was in here before me.",Thats funny. You sure thats still you in there?
I know about the methadone.,sighing It's legal. I have a prescription.,And you know about that stuff?
WhatEver doctor you conned into writing it clearly had no idea about your addiction issues Your lack of,He knows I'm in pain. What I put in my body is my business.,"Uh, gift? Uh, Present!"
"You keep taking this, you could die.","If you'd said that if I keep doing this you could die, then it'd be your business.","Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous."
"I can't sit by and watch you kill yourself. As long as you're in my hospital, you can't do methadone.",I'll send someone for my stuff. He starts to walk out,"Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?"
"That's it, you're quitting? You're choosing methadone over this job?",I'm choosing lack of pain over this job. He walks out,"What, you, you really quit your job?"
to House Who was she?,I hired her to watch me sleep make sure I don't stop breathing.,"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10."
Home nurses usually wear scrubs.,She's not a nurse.,"Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress."
You hired a hooker to watch you sleep? That just can't He stops as House walks into the living room. He looks astonished,"Surprisingly, hookers are cheaper. And they don't sue for sexual harassment. holding up two ties Which one?","Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm."
"holding up two ties Which one? You, shaved.",The red one then.,Wheres your tie?
You have two ties?,walking across the room to a small mirror on the wall Meeting at St. Sebastian's today. Gonna try and talk 'em into starting up a diagnostics department.,"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and well all be wearing silver jump suits."
Sounds great. I just came by to check up on you. See how you were doing.,Tying his tie in front of the mirror I'm fine.,"Hey, just wanted to check in."
Which means it's not scleroderma.,"I have an interview, in two hours.",Let me beat around the bush for a second.
"I have an interview, in two hours. Wow.",Hand over my letter of recommendation.,"Hey, hey, how is your interview going?"
"Sorry, I haven't done it yet.",You have no right to sabotage,"Easy peasy, Im doing it right now."
"I was busy with this. She hands him a sheet of paper It's a list of requirements for your methadone treatment. Weekly drug tests. Supervised doses administered on a precise schedule, by me, or, one of the nurses.","Seems weird, getting my meds here when I'm working somewhere else.",Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script.
Yes. pause I'm offering you your job back. She sits down,I want a raise.,I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
I want a raise. No.,And a bigger office... but in the same spot.,Lets get down to business.
No. We both know this is where you belong.,Okay.,"I know who you are, and I think you should go."
"Welcome back. House starts for the door, then pauses and turns around",sincerely Thank you.,"When you are done, open the door."
He leaves You okay?,I have issues with authority. You?,"Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?"
We thought you were gone.,Cuddy missed me.,I thought you left a long time ago.
And what happened to your cane?,She asked to borrow it for some reason. Patient dead or do I need to do anything? House takes off his tie and loosens his shirt collar,"Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?"
It's not scleroderma.,"Wow. Two days, and you've already got two separate theories. House sits down","Yeah, see, I cant pull of babydoll can I?"
Which rules out scleroderma.,When did you two come up with this?,"Oh, well, then good!"
We ran into each other in the lobby. She sits down,"So, what did we miss? When I say we I mean you, since I wasn't here.",She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
We've ruled out Zollinger-Ellison.,That was a dumb idea.,"Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto."
That was a dumb idea. Why?,Because it was wrong.,I thought it was a fun idea.
"Also toxoplasmosis, dehydration, SLE, various intersex disorders.","Oh, crap. pause This kid like energy drinks?",Is that friend Wolowitz?
But energy drinks don't explain,Nice work. He gets up and heads for the door,It is not just coffee.
"So, we're okay?",Why wouldn't we be? to Thirteen about her shoes Nice heels. House leaves,"So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?"
Why wouldn't we be? to Thirteen about her shoes Nice heels. House leaves,This is all your parents' fault.,My kid needs shoes!
This is all your parents' fault. Excuse me?,"to Jackson Chug a lot of energy drinks before, during, and after practice? Jackson nods","Y... You dont understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, Im gonna tell it that you were responsible."
"to Jackson Chug a lot of energy drinks before, during, and after practice? Jackson nods",Your son came in here with simple dehydration. That's why he collapsed during the game.,"Here you go Joe, heres the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for."
The ER treated him for that. It didn't help the pain.,That's where the energy drinks came in. They put a strain on his kidneys so he needed more time to rebound from the initial dehydration.,"Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call."
Then why isn't he better?,That's where your idiocy came in.,Thats because hes twice as good.
It was your freaked-out overprotectiveness that nearly killed him. Nearly?,"He's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine.","Yeah, you almost overreacted to something."
"He's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine.",You gave birth to a freak of nature. He turns and opens the door Doesn't mean it's a good idea to treat him like one. House leaves the room,Dont you try and blame this on him.
"Starting tomorrow, you'll come to my office for your fix.",I'm done with the methadone. I screwed up.,"So uh, heres your office set!"
The kid's parents wanted that MRI.,I knew he didn't need it. I did it anyway. That's what got him sick.,"OK, so what, youre just never gonna see him again?"
You just solved a case that no one else could solve.,"I created a case. I played nice because, I was in a good mood because, I didn't hurt. He gets up","Gentlemen, I believe Ive found the solution to all our problems."
You don't need your pain to be a good doctor.,firmly I'm not interested in good.,"Guys? Everything ok? Its me, Joe..."
You're afraid to be happy.,Why do you care if I'm happy?,Youre afraid. Just like Hodor.
"You're afraid of change. The one thing you have is your intellect. You think if that's compromised, you have nothing. She holds up the dose of methadone Just take it.",No.,"Youre right. Without realizing it, Ive allowed that woman to alter my personality."
Don't do this.,It's already done. He throws the methadone in the wastebasket and grabs a hospital cane which is propped against the wall This is the only me you get.,I wasnt invited.
holding out a file Cameron brought this up from the ER.,Doesn't look like a friendship bracelet.,"Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues?"
"It's Phineas Gage, the most famous case study in medical history.",You're telling me this Patient got a railroad spike drilled through his frontal lobe? He takes the Patient file,"Lets see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak."
Gage was a different person after the spike. Argumentative. Impulsive.,Whereas our guy became a different person after Chardonnay.,So were gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
"He was sober when they brought him in. There's also the nosebleed, the collapse.",to Foreman MRI show anything?,"Oh, hes sober alright."
to Foreman MRI show anything? smiling Nothing.,Good. What fun would that be? So the tumor's not in the cool neighborhood. It's cool neighborhood adjacent.,"I just meant that youre not married and your boyfriends kind of, Sheldon."
A well-placed tumor in the nasal cavity eroding into the brain could do the damage.,handing the file to Foreman Go stick a scope up Phineas's nose. See what you find. The team leaves,"Monica and Rachels, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are sitting at the table eating dinner and not talking."
"Make this go away. to Taub, as he prepares to put the tube up Nick's nose God, that honker really is huge, isn't it?",Wednesday night. Low-down-blue-meanie versus the Incinerator.,Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Low-down-blue-meanie versus the Incinerator. I can't.,Let me rephrase. Low-down-blue-meanie,Death by fire is the purest death.
I understand monster truck code. Do you understand can't?,"Not when it follows low-down-blue-meanie. Is the world coming to an end Tuesday night? Otherwise, Wednesdaythey stop",Couldnt have this conversation down at the truck huh?
"All right, it's not can't. It's don't want to. The fact is, I just don't like monster trucks.","Yes, you do.","Well, a lot of people cant."
"No, I don't.",You've always liked monster trucks.,She doesnt get to choose.
"No, you've always liked them. I've tolerated them.",What are you hiding?,You what? You said you liked them.
Luckily jerkiness is a temporary condition for this guy.,"No, it's not. We may be able to fix his impulse to say his thoughts out loud, but he always gonna be the guy who thinks them.","You know, I know hes a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him."
"But he's also gonna be the guy who doesn't say them. If he spent his whole life constructing this nice guy persona, isn't that as much who he really is as anything else?",You would argue that. You're all persona.,I dont know.
"I agree with Wilson. This guy's a Harry Potter. House and Wilson look at him questioningly The sorting hat was going to put Harry in Slytherin based on his nature. He refused, so he ended up in Gryffindor, through choice.",There's damage somewhere in his brain. Go find it. Kutner leaves,"Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim."
Your tush is like the pistons in a Ferrari.,You're welcome.,"You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush."
That was for my benefit?,You're 40 years old!,"You returned the favor, as I recall."
You're 40 years old! 38,The administrator of a hospital!,"Michael, youre at least forty six!"
Dean of medicine.,People don't get personal with you.,I believe thats the president of the university.
So that was your way of saying I look good today.,You didn't get the slightest kick out of that?,"Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?"
Just proving a point.,Anyone sitting here?,Im just saying.
Just my persona.,"You know, it's amazing the way people cling on to insults.","So, tell me a little bit about yourself."
So that wasn't an insult?,"I'm not suggesting that, like our Patient, you're hiding a dark, sarcastic core beneath a candy shell of compulsive niceness. House has pulled a fork out of his breast pocket","Joey and Rachels apartment, Chandler is entering with a peace offering of a Joey Special, two pizzas."
I'm not always nice. I'm not nice to you.,Because you know nice bores me.,"Uhhuh, Im normally very nice, but you shut up, too."
"Because when my parents put me in the rocket and sent me here, they said, James, you will grow to Manhood under a yellow sun.",And why'd you lie about monster trucks?,"Cause, Im a stupid, stupid man."
And why'd you lie about monster trucks? I didn't.,"I checked your appointment book. You got tomorrow night marked off, but you didn't put down what you were doing. So you thought someone might look at the book","Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price."
"I'm playing racquetball tomorrow night, with Taub.",Why would you hide that?,Just your dad.
"Because the world revolves around you. I devote time to anyone else, you'd end up stalking me and harassing them.",You say that as though it wouldn't be fun.,Because you dont want me to be happy.
We know it's not systemic sclerosis.,"to Taub Hey, Cyrano de Berkowitz. Let it go.",This war isnt about you.
The CBC showed normal white blood cells.,to Taub So how long have you been playing racquetball with Wilson?,And how would we range north?
So he's a late bloomer. His daughter has a neurological condition.,"swinging his cane like a tennis racket First of all, Wilson played tennis on his college team, and you are a Jew.",He realized long ago that the greatest thing hed ever create was his daughter.
Sandy Koufax is Jewish. Greatest left-handed pitcher of all time.,"Sandy Koufax is all you Jews go on about. Sandy Koufax, and the Holocaust. he sits down Gets old.","Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish."
"There are dozens of congenital conditions that fit our parameters. We can't spend time gene testing for all of 'em, especially when we're only guessing it's congenital.",to Taub Is a z-shot offensive or defensive?,"No. We are committing genetic fraud. Theres no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers."
to Taub Is a z-shot offensive or defensive? It's both.,You suspected that was a trick question.,"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!"
But I could have said neither. Diabetes makes more sense.,We can narrow the testing down to 40 likely candidates. Test for peripheral nerve damage.,"Well, type two diabetes runs in my family."
He's got brain damage. He's likely to have peripheral nerve damage no matter what the cause.,"Yes, that's why we should not test him for it.","Joey, its been three days, okay."
They have to be done Every couple hours. You're punishing me because you're jealous that I'm spending time with your best friend.,That would be petty. I'm punishing you because now you've joined my best friend in lying to me. Let me know when you're ready to confess Everything. The team leaves,"If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed."
Why'd you page me here?,still tossing the ball I need you to update me on the Patient's condition.,Why the hell did you come back here?
Seems to be dead. Why'd you page me here?,I need you to update me on the Patient's condition he sits up and holds up the ball while hitting this against the wall.,"It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now Ive heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission."
I finished the last blood draw.,I expect the people who work for me to rise to a challenge. Unless they don't expect to work for me.,Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
Last blood draw was at 600 AM. Sugar lEvels nEver rose above 120 all night. Taub misses and has to Chase down the ball and start again,So the glucose was normal. Means you were wrong about diabetes.,"900 to 1000, checked in with receptionist."
hitting the ball again I still think it's the endocrine system. Maybe I just got the wrong gland.,So you're going for thyroid instead of pancreas? Makes sense.,Lets look at this logically.
Fine. I'm not playing racquetball with Wilson. I was nEver playing racquetball with Wilson. pause I thought it would be helpful if a Department Head owed me a favor. But it's not worth this.,nods Not bad.,"Well, not playing raquetball!"
"What kind of infection? It could be anything Staph aureus, tuberculosis, strongyloides!","Go back to Phineas, get a history.",Whered you get that from?
We've got a history. He hasn't been out of the country.,Get a detailed history.,"Yeah, hes lived here for years, I dont, I dont know what youre talking about man."
No one at home is sick. No one at work is sick. There's no sign of ticks or mosquitoes.,Get a more detailed history. Ask him again. And again until he remembers something. Taub starts to leave,No. Dont do that. Youre not. Youre not stupid.
Get a more detailed history. Ask him again. And again until he remembers something. Taub starts to leave,to Taub Not you. Kutner can do it. You're gonna be busy with something else. Kutner leaves,Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?
"Guy leads a boring life. They stay home a lot. No travel, no exotic pets, no nearby standing water.",You sound pleased about something. Can we get to that part?,"Bug report When a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching TV."
"His wife rescues dogs. Among others, a big rottweiler who's taken over the House. Our Patient hates it.",Was the wife there to hear this?,"Hes great. were all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, Im a dog nurse."
Was the wife there to hear this? No.,Too bad. Keep going.,"No, but its okay."
The dog marks his territory all over the living room. I asked what the odds were that he would have put down food or drink where the dog could reach. He said he put a glass of juice on the floor while he was fixing the television.,The dog was fixing the television?,Ive had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea.
The dog was fixing the television? Yes.,The Patient's eyes red?,"Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV."
Yeah. I'm thinking Weil's.,"Bacterial. He lucked out. Start him on doxycycline. If he improves, we'll know we were right.","Williams That one I can tell you, yes."
I told Wilson you sent me to get information.,"And now you're telling me. What does that make you, a quadruple agent? They walk into House's office",And youve waited this long to deliver the information?
He let me print out his e-mails.,Wow. Excellent. Information he wants us to have. Did he let you print out his deleted e-mails?,"We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number."
Did he let you print out his deleted e-mails? No.,Then go back there,"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away."
"As long as I was sitting there, I thought I'd print 'em anyway. He hands a stack paper to House Top one's the one you're looking for.",reading the email Writing to confirm Wednesday at 700 PM.,Mmmh. I printed them out on my computer.
It's out going to jgonzaleznymercy.net. There's a Joan Gonzalez in oncology. It's a consult.,"Secret consult, 700 PM. He finds a picture of Joan Gonzalez online Oh, Joan is perky.","Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina."
You're wrong. There was a Patient file attached.,Where? He holds out his hand for the file,You dont take my clients away and give them to a secretary.
It was password-protected.,"No. Wilson doesn't password-protect his Patient files. I'm the only one he'd expect Ever to look there, and he knows there's only one Patient I'd want to check on.","Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so passwordprotected."
You think Wilson's sick?,"typing again If Wilson had cancer, there'd be no reason for him to drive three hours to Manhattan.","Well normally I dont, but yknowGreen Bay is playing."
"I don't want to ask this, but, have you Ever had reason to think he might be depressed?","turning to look at Taub and speaking very curtly No. Get out of here. Taub leaves, House looks worried","No, I havent had a chance to be alone with him yet."
Get the hell out of my room. Kutner and Foreman leave,"getting up and approaParkng Wilson Your assistant said that you were out of the hospital, taking a walk.","Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room."
Is there an emergency?,I don't know. Is there? You nEver take a walk unless you've got something you need to think about.,"Um, were kind of having an emergency and wewe were looking for something."
reading his messages Maybe you just don't have a good statistical sampling of my walks.,The other thing you do when you need to think is you come to my office.,"OK. Um, how come Im walking with you?"
Taub. another graduate of the House school of being a dick.,Private dick.,Jeb. A street pusher.
"Look, I'd love to stay for the full inquisition, but I need some hot coffee.","Of course you need hot coffee. It's 45 degrees outside, and you left your coat upstairs. Why?","Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee."
getting his coffee You're going to tell me why I forgot my coat?,"Once you get outside, the cold would have reminded you.",Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
House walks in and Nick approaches him Nick Greenwald. I hear you're the guy in charge. I'm the Patient with the disinhibition.,"If you're here to say thanks, you're welcome. Now go away.","Mr. Zelners Office, hes in a meeting as Joey bursts in."
"Oh, I'm not thankful. I'm pissed.","Oh, all the more reason to go away.","This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."
They're talking about sending me home. To what? A life where I'll continually drive away anyone who might for a second care about me?,Those are the breaks. He walks over to his desk,Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
You could operate.,You could die.,I could be a secretary.
"So I'm either better or dead? I'm okay with that. he moves to face House on the other side of his desk I I've always been kind of a! an imPatient guy. But I've worked hard to keep my mouth shut. I've made my wife happy. I've made my little girl happy. I want that back. Otherwise, it's no life.",handing Nick's file to Chase I want you to remove a small pRoblem.,"Right. Hes not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, its a little weird, but its getting better. Oh well, Im gonna miss this woman so much. I dont know what Im going to do! I mean, its been 20 years of my life."
taking the file and glancing at it I'm not a neurosurgeon.,But your boss is. You could assist. I'm sure you'd like to add to your resume.,"Hey, um, can I ask you a question?"
It's too near the brain stem. Nobody's gonna touch it.,Your boss would.,"Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry."
You want me to help you? He turns to face House Tell me why.,Why what?,Why do I need you now?
Why you care. The puzzle's solved. The guy's alive. And the odds of coming out of this surgery with that same status aren't that great.,My Patient has a quality of life issue.,"You know, why dont we split the order?"
"He says awful things, hardly a medical condition.","with eyes downcast, not making eye contact with Chase When he leaves here, he's going to lose his family.","Dont take it personally, its his pathology, he cant talk to women."
giving a slight nod I'll see what I can do.,looking at Wilson You've apparently got this whole coat thing backwards.,"Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that."
I may have overreacted.,You definitely overreacted.,"Really, do you think I overreacted?"
I knew you'd meet me halfway.,It made me think.,"Look, youve got to meet me halfway here."
Maybe the reason I don't always open up to you is because it's redundant.,Daniel Wilson.,Since when cant you open up with me?
"There have been new anti-psychotics dEveloped since he ran away. He's been on them for a couple of days, and by tonight, he should be in shape to talk to me.",But you're not sure if he wants to.,"Dont try to call him or anything, cause hes not there, hes out."
"I'll be in New York in a few hours, and I guess I'll find out.",Why wouldn't you tell me this?,I havent been to New York in a long time.
"House, you and I! We don't have the normal social contract. I don't expect you to tell me the lies",I am fully capable of lying to you. I've lied plenty of times.,I get to write a contract?
"I mean, collaborative lies. Giving someone a hand who maybe needs to deceive themselves, just a little. Wilson gets up For two days I've been thinking about how Danny's gonna react when he sees me. If I said that to anybody else, they'd say, don't worry, it'll all be all right. You wouldn't.",Because it might all go horribly wrong.,You want me to lie to Chandler?
"he laughs Yeah. Yeah, it might. He turns to leave","In which case, you might want some company. Wilson walks back toward House as if he cannot beliEve what he just heard",It will. Ive never begged for anything but Im begging you. Dont do this. Please.
Feel free to send him an IM.,handing Wilson his coffee and sitting down across from him You told me you saw your brother once. After he disappeared.,"I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk."
"13 years ago. I used to go to Princeton whenEver I could. I must have hit Every homeless shelter in town. And then one day, I'm just sitting at this deli, having a sandwich, I look out the window, and there he is. He was gone by the time I got outside.",That's why you were so eager when I told you there was a job at Princeton. I thought it was just my charm.,"Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that Im looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!"
That's the team. Shouldn't you answer?,They already texted me to say they're doing something stupid. Wilson smiles,"But I answered, its called teamwork."
We'll find out. They leave,The spell-correct on Kutner's phone has got a hair trigger.,OK. I dont think were coming back.
"He closes his phone You took a walk in 45-degree weather, and you left your coat behind. Go ahead.",I think you were punishing yourself.,"No, you wont, because hes not picking up his phone."
"The sParkzophrenia started when he was a teenager. When he was in college! He was on meds, but he'd still think a professor was out to get him because he got a B, or he'd fight with his roommates because he nEver showered.",Where were you?,Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
"Med school. He, called me, Every day. Talked for hours. I didn't have hours.",Interesting. Later for that. Go on.,Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
"I was tired of being the guy that Everybody counted on, so one night, Danny called One night, Danny called, crying, upset about something. I had to study for an exam. So I I hung up! Took my things. I went to the library so I wouldn't have to hear the phone ring.",I wonder how that turned out?,"Oh, that is so sweet."
"My mother called me the next day. Danny had run away and left his meds behind. Which I knew meant that he would nEver be able to choose to come back, because he'd be so detached from reality.","So you made your one effort to live a normal, selfish life, and the universe immediately smacked you down.","Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, Im"
You don't think that's a little facile?,"Actually, I don't.","Kind of inappropriate, dont you think?"
It was a pretty big Event.,Hanging up the phone?,It was pretty big.
"We're not talking about my brother anymore, are we?",It's House. AVMs don't explain his glucose.,Hes still my older brother.
"Since this is a significant moment in my life and all, I! he shrugs",into the phone Yeah.,"Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?"
talking to House who is not listening I think I'll just go in then.,still talking on his phone Explain that.,Okay. Great. Ill see you when you get here. Im gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
Right. He picks up his coat and follows the attendant out of the waiting room. House is too focused to notice,You'd given him steroids.,Leonard approaches Pennys door.
It doesn't explain the organ failure or the brain damage.,This whole thing is an overreaction.,"It doesnt make sense, of course Im alive."
I'm sure she's moved on. Nick sits in a wheelchair and Audrey wheels him out of the room Kids are so resilient.,You okay?,"Oh, good for her."
I'll be seeing Danny again next week. I'd like you to meet him.,Sure. He sounds interesting. knowing that Wilson has more to say Go on.,I look forward to meeting him.
"I thought seeing him again would change Everything. It would be wonderful or terrible. Instead! we're just strangers. It's kind of, anticlimactic.",Which is better than terrible.,"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, yknow? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
Which is better than terrible. Go on.,Does it bother you that we have no social contract?,"Im not saying it was bad, Im just saying it wasnt great."
"laughs My whole life is one big compromise. I tiptoe around Everyone like they're made of Parkna. I spend all my time analyzing What will the effect be if I say this? Then there's you. You're a reality junkie. If I offered you a comforting lie, you'd smack me over the head with it. Let's not change that.",Okay.,Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?
"No, see, this if you were implementing the social contract, you'd say that, but only because! It makes me feel better!",It is kind of fun watParkng you torture yourself.,If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs.
Do you think things will work out with my brother?,"No. But when it does go wrong, it won't be your fault.",You talk to my brother this way?
"But when it does go wrong, it won't be your fault. Thanks, House.",You do actually like monster trucks?,As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
"You have a Patient waiting, see? She indiCates Morgan West who is standing behind her in the exam room door.",I'm waiting for a follow-up.,"Rachels Office, Tag is arriving as Rachel is standing there."
I had colds all winter.,"I've been in this room a while, but it's spring now, right? He climbs off the table he was standing on.","Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around cause theres a worm inside."
I feel run-down like maybe something big is coming on.,"Run-down. Come on, give me something. Sore throat?","I dont know, yknow?"
Sore throat? No.,Runny nose?,"Okay, what just happened?"
"No. I know it sounds weird, I'm a nurse, but could you run maybe a CBC or thyroid up","loudly Dr. Cuddy, I need a consult. Cuddy enters. Until she stops seizing, I may as well go back to my office and get my diagnosis on.","Till then, we need a new acting manager."
She's urinating on herself.,She's having a seizure. If she hadn't peed it would!,"She looks at it when shes on the potty, and she makes the faces."
If she hadn't peed it would! It's green.,Interesting.,Mine was green.
It's green. Interesting.,35-year-old Woman. Head of nursing at an old age home.,"Ok. First of all, this is green!"
Neuro is also written in green. Does that mean she has green neurological symptoms as well?,From now on I'm gonna use two colors. Green indiCates irony.,"Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green."
Why are we taking this case?,"Welcome, your lordship. We were just preparing your morning briefing.",Why arent you as mad or interested in this as me?
"Sorry I'm late. And, yes, green pee does meet the only diagnostic requirement you care about! it's interesting. But is it worth us taking this case?",Us aren't taking anything. I'm taking. You're accepting.,Okay thats the green stuff talkin.
"Okay, I accept. She has adult-onset epilepsy, and she really likes those Saint Patrick's Day beers.",looking away Go check out the House and the office for toxins and infections.,"Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Merediths work performance."
Her neuro exam was normal. No subsequent seizures. It's not life-threatening. It's not important.,"Luckily, neither are you.",I got it for Christmas.
"You got conned. Methylthioninium chloride. Notable side effect, green urine. She's a nurse. She knows the dosage. Knows how to fake a seizure. She pees pea soup and gets the warm attention of doctors all week long. She's a Munchausen and you're her mark.",So your insight is based on discovering an anti-Alzheimer's drug at an old-age home.,"Dont worry, its just a bull tranquilizer."
No good reason it'd be sitting in her desk.,You Ever tried to pee on yourself in public? It's not easy.,Left it in the middle of your office.
"Sorry, I rushed the Jewish frat. We peed in private.",For good reason. I can spot a fake seizure. Which means this was real. Which means her pRoblem is phenol.,"Yeah, I rushed a few fraternities, but you know what?"
"Carbolic acid? Yeah, maybe she accidentally inhaled some at a gout treatment facility circa 1890.",It's still in some antiseptic throat sprays. She's been chugging it all winter for her colds. Phenol explains the seizure and the urine.,"Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
She'd have to drink five bottles a day.,Which is why I'm sure you won't have trouble discovering evidence of it when you search her House.,She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks.
"Oh, you were lying about the throat spray. That does make more sense. So why are you wasting Taub's time?",Because I don't want him to know that I'm wasting my time disproving his fake seizure theory. He indiCates zipping his lip. Zip.,"Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass."
Hi. Tests back?,Head CT was negative.,"Okay, were almost ready to go."
What about a thyroid uptake or abdominal ultrasound?,Sure. How about I flash some lights in front of your face first?,"I... Im sorry, who should be along in a what now?"
You want me to have another seizure?,We're gonna have to give up the room unless we can confirm a pRoblem.,I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
We're gonna have to give up the room unless we can confirm a pRoblem. Okay.,Dammit.,Okay. I have guests coming. Im afraid Im going to have to ask you to leave now.
"Please forgive me, I'm so sorry.",What are you worried about? You have maybe a night in jail for fraud. I have to go tell one of my employees he was right.,"Oh, I want him to find out."
I'm not a Munchausen. I'm gonna die unless you help me.,You'll have to come up with something more original.,I cant let you starve.
A cat predicted my death.,"Cats make terrible doctors. Oh no, wait, that's women. You're screwed. He leaves.","No, no, no, no, I didnt forget."
"A few years back, I was one of them. Good luck, Neil.","If you're going to kill me and rape me, please do it in that order.","Well, are any of those people here?"
"This is the cat, Debbie. Have you heard of her?","Debbie. Sorry, but without a last name!",You call her Debbie?
"She was in the news. We found her as a kitten. She lives in the nursing home. She only sleeps next to people when they're about to die. House enters his office and closes the door in her face. Ten Patients in the last year. And then yesterday she did it to me while I was sitting on my couch. Please, the whole staff, the doctors Even, we all know this is real.",calling from his desk Can you come back later? I have some business I'm conducting with the Prince of Nigeria.,"OK. Smelly cat, smellly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?"
"Just watch this video. She holds a tape against the door. It'll prove I'm not lying. Dr. House, I am begging you. She starts to gasp loudly and drops the tape. She puts down the carrier as she sinks to the floor. Chest.",Quick! Before she goes without attention for eight seconds.,Is this the tape of me falling?
Before she goes without attention for eight seconds. House.,"He gets up, goes to the door but doesn't open it. She's faking. The cat told me.",The apartment. Penny walks in without knocking and collapses on the sofa.
"Debbie the cat spends most of her time just prowling the halls, the queen of her own private world.","Gotta say, I don't think the changes they've made to American Idol really work for me.",Who has her own little desk when Rolands not there.
You want to treat her? She's a nut job.,Don't we all have quirks? Aren't those eccentricities what make us huMan?,I have a legal obligation to Angela.
The doctors we spoke to also agree!,Nut jobs get sick too.,"How you doing, Jordan?"
So you think this cat story is nonsense. And you admit she faked her earlier symptoms. But you still think she's actually sick now?,"Well, anything would sound ridiculous if you said it in that voice.","300, we have 300."
Confirm she's faking or I'm gonna have to kick her out.,There's that voice again.,What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! Thats it! Yknow what? Im just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
I'll give you 24 hours.,Consecutive?,Take as long as you want.
What are you doing?,"holding Debbie No, Mister Bond, I expect you to die. Bronchospasm, go.","Excuse me. Oh, damn. Its my mother."
"No cough, no fEver, and Blofeld didn't smoke a cigar.",He might have.,Idiot. Dwights an idiot! Did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it?
"Lungs were clean on the CT. Dogs can be trained to predict diabetic comas, epileptic seizures they can smell cancer. It is possible there's something in this cat.",It's more possible that it was just a coincidence. 10 million nursing homes.,Im not sure Ive ever smelled a dead cat.
Maybe the cat didn't predict anything. Might have caused the deaths.,We shoulda listened to Ted Nugent.,"I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy."
"Yeah, it could be cat scratch fEver or visceral larva migrans. Maybe he didn't kill Everyone at the nursing home, but it may be killing Morgan.",The worms hop from the cat to the cat lady's lungs. I could buy that.,"Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat."
pulling an empty cigar box from House's trash Those cigars were for me.,"Hey, that reminds me, why is some fancy CEO sending you a box of Cuban cigars? Is it related to your money worries?",All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and Im not stopping for anyone.
What money worries?,"Extrapolating from the fact that he's been skipping his morning muffin, I'd say that he lost almost all his money on the market last year.","Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?"
I'm on a diet.,I'm also extrapolating from the online portfolio you forget to log off. But it's mostly the muffins. Scope her for worms in the lungs.,"If youre implying that Id have some problem with him moving into my room, youre wrong."
There are no worms in the lungs.,What else could cause bronchospasm?,"No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs."
Why are you pushing a crash cart?,"Because Patients sometimes crash, and they haven't yet invented a crash tractor for me to drive wildly around the hallways.",You were home alone and had no one to play with?
You actually think the cat is going to predict someone's death?,"No, I know the cat is not going to predict anyone's death. Then I will have scientifically disproved!","I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother."
"You didn't keep this Patient despite the cat, you kept this Patient because of the cat. You're scared there's something to it.","If I could prove the non-existence of an omniscient God who lovingly guides us to the other side, I would.","Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"
"Cats' brains are always in alpha mode. The few scientific tests that have seemed to confirm psyParkc phenomena, that's where it takes place.",Please tell me that you were kidding so I won't have to fire you.,Only when youre in a CAT scanner.
Don't you want to check their charts?,Of course not. This is a double-blind. I don't want to Even subconsciously,"Wow, graphs and charts, somebodys really been doing their homework."
checking the chart He has a sEvere cat allergy.,injecting the Patient with something That nEver happened.,He is an indoor cat.
Look at Debbie.,"Good news, Mister!",This is Debbie.
I told you to get rid of death cat.,Do you see a cat?,I did not kill him.
I see a litter box.,"brandishing his cane This is a disability, Dr. Cuddy. Can't make it to the men's room on time.",Phoebes apartment. She is packing a few tings into boxes.
You pee on the mice too?,"Well, now you see the mice actually prove that I don't have a cat. There's a tank of mice in the corner.","Eh, you know, it really doesnt make sense to name the mice."
Are these! are these the genetically modified lab mice from oncology?,Genetically modified for tastiness. He smacks his lips together sEveral times.,You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
taking the mice Get rid of the cat and get rid of your Patient.,My team's doing a methacholine challenge.,"Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house."
"Your team just completed a methacholine challenge, which came up negative.",Who told you about the test? Taub?,"Okay, I dont know where you just came from, but it couldnt have been a team meeting because Im on the team and I wasnt there, ergo the team did not meet."
I'll nEver say. But yes.,"Her airways clamped down. I heard it. We kick her onto the street, it could happen again. I wish there was a lawsuit cat. It could warn you.","You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car."
"I'm sorry, but if you won't escort her out, I'll have to get security to do it. She leaves.",You're joining me for a good-bye smoke.,Why dont you just tell her not to come?
I don't smoke.,Fine.,You dont secretly smoke do you?
I'm not a super!,"How 'bout four years, that sound right? That's when you switched from a family insurance plan to the one you're on now.","First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldnt be the sidekick."
I was married. I got divorced.,"Two years before that, you got Parkcken pox shots, which you only get in adulthood when you have a kid.","Well, dont get me wrong."
"It was my stepson, Timothy. She coughs as House continues to blow smoke at her.",What happened?,"Pam, it wasnt her."
He was in school. He was having his morning snack. And he choked. And the teacher saw it and they did Everything that they were supposed to. He shouldn't have died.,You want to make it make sense.,I hate that he died that way.
crying What's wrong with that?,"It's meaningless, is what's wrong.",Whats it... why are you crying?
I can't breathe.,"Hey, doc. He calls over a doctor who is nearby. Breath sound soft to you, doc? The doctor listens to Morgan's chest and nods. Hooray! You're officially sick.","Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler."
"Hey, doc. He calls over a doctor who is nearby. Breath sound soft to you, doc? The doctor listens to Morgan's chest and nods. Hooray! You're officially sick.","Churg-Strauss fits best. Here's the plan! Taub, change the litter box.","Oh, yeah, youre not feeling well little guy?"
This is pathetic. You're still punishing me for calling you out on the green urine lady?,"Nope, this is for ratting me out to Cuddy. I'm not asking you to apologize, just scoop some poop out of a box.","Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training."
"Now that you've delivered that important lesson, I'm gonna go test the Patient.","What, you think your bag's gonna die now?","Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and youll be fine."
Now you're punishing me because you think I'm superstitious? What do you care?,It's not so much about me caring per se.,"Did I? Doesnt sound like me, not very superstitious."
"It's brown. I didn't do anything, honest.",I'm just a girl who can't say no.,It looks pretty black.
It is possible she's still faking.,hanging his cane on a bookshelf She didn't fake the bronchospasm. You think she's faking some stuff but not other stuff? Maybe she's Unchausen.,Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
I'm just saying the brown urine doesn't make sense. What?,Nothing.,"Well, thats odd."
We've ruled out Every possible cause for brown urine. No blood in the urine. Liver and kidneys fine.,Brown could be fecal. A fistula!,Do your worst.
How do we know the urine is still brown?,Had to be. Once you've gone brown!,What if we have to pee?
"If we've ruled out Everything that can make the urine brown, what if it just looked brown? If the green dye nEver left her system, what plus green makes brown?",sitting Purple. Strep bovis infection from colon cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the bronchospasm.,"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red."
We scoped her when we checked for the fistula. There's no tumor.,"Oh, no.","All right, everybody."
I wasn't scared by the umbrella either.,"What? Not Everything's about you, Kutner.",I shouldve brought an umbrella.
I realize it's stupid. I just! I don't know Everything. I don't want to invite!,"Great, 'cause I thought your superstitiousness had to do with your folks being killed.","Oh, but, could we not go together?"

Sorry I was late again. I've got a long commute from the poor House.,Knew it when I hired you.,Im sorry. Am I late?
"Don't worry, I'm not quitting.",I know. Guy who signs a non-compete instead of just telling his wife that he cheated doesn't have the guts to quit.,"No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? Im sorry."
Bad example. I did tell her.,"From guilt, not from courage.","You said you told her, but you never did!"
"From guilt, not from courage. And bravely running to Cuddy behind my back. Arriving heroically late Every day. Cowards make lousy employees. Maybe you're a coward, maybe you're quitting. Either way, I'm screwed. He leaves.","You will note how Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! has snuggled up by Coma Guy over there. And more importantly, she did yesterday as well. And he's still breathing. We done?","As my father used to say, its better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
standing and walking to the bed Thank you for showing me this. But maybe she's just confused in this new environment.,In 1844 a preacher in upstate New York added up some dates in the bible and predicted Jesus' return.,One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart.
You're trying to prove to her she's not dying?,That would be dumb as she might be dying.,"Well, I guess thats not"

Stop it, Dr. Wilson. It's just not cute anymore!","Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that Im perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence."
You already experimented on the coma guy. Haven't you proved your point?,Not to the Patient. And not to the millions of idiots who drooled over that news item about the magic cat.,"So, you can experiment on all the apes you want."
Why are you so obsessed with this? Can't you just call her an idiot and leave Everyone alone?,"Hey, look, kids, therapy cat.",You shut up!
"You're a liar. Therapy animals are dogs, not cats.",Aren't you feisty? This one's special. If she likes you interesting stuff happens.,"Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you dont get there if youre euthanized."

How Many times are we gonna watch this? There's no tumor.,"Oh my God, the death cat is attacking your legs. You're going to die.","Yeah, see, whats happening here signals brain damage."
Maybe it has something to do with that little red dot dancing around down there.,"continuing to point the laser at Kutner's feet Oh my God, the death laser is attacking your legs. You're going to die.",Do you think maybe its tight because youre wearing long underwear?
Maybe we're not wasting time. We wouldn't have seen a flat lesion.,Skin cancer could have metastasized to the intestines. Cool. Check for melanomas.,Perhaps this was a waste of time.

I think she's dying.,I just told you it's Cushing's. We treat!,"Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything?"
I don't mean because of the spider veins. Mr. Limpert died.,If that's my high school gym teacher!,"Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages."

MRI's aren't telling us if the Cushing's in her adrenals or her brain.,So check her ACTH.,"No. We should all have dinner. Yes, well do it tomorrow night. Ill cook!!"
ACTH is 11.7. It's too close to tell. We can't treat the wrong organ 'cause that won't solve anything. She could have a cortisol storm. Could kill her.,"Well, maybe as the senior fellow you could have made sure that my doors were closed, so that I could be concentrating on the cat instead of looking for the","So, no ones gonna tell me?"

That's an excellent use of my time. Maybe I'll discover that my Parkldhood wasn't perfect.,I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
So your attitude about therapy clearly hasn't changed. And yet you went. Which leads me to beliEve that maybe something else has changed. The stop by the elevator. Maybe you think you can change.

slurring Gotta be perfect.,You spit it out?,Its hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
She can resume her vigil over her husband who started fading again.,"Win some, lose some. And strictly speaking, since he's not my Patient, win some. Look at the time. It's half past Taub was lying about Kutner.","What?! You cant shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!"
"He pRobably went to a comic book fest, spent the night at some Wonder Woman's lair. I'm sure he'll","Find out what or who he's doing. Either way, Cuddy's gonna want me to write it under reason for termination.","Okay, great, I mean, it doesnt have to be a big party or anything."
He's cold. Eric!,He didn't say anything? To any of you? Family pRoblems? Bad relationship? Financial pressures?,"Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric."
His parents were shot right in front of him.,Parents are ancient history.,"Oh, arent you sweet, his fathers dead."
Not to someone who actually cares.,He didn't slit his wrists and!,Right. Just not to me.
You're blaming us?,shakes head slightly Just trying to figure it out.,I cant help but feel partially responsible.
This isn't our fault! Something like 25% of suicidal people show no outward signs of depression.,No. 25% of suicidal people have friends who didn't notice anything and don't want to feel guilty.,"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
"We still have a Patient. Actually, two. One worsening, one who should be worsening.",You can't be in denial about Kutner and the husband.,"How I am is not dead, but you wouldnt know that, because you dont love me enough to pick up the phone."
It's possible Eddie's body is willing itself to live.,"Well, call the tabloids. Tell them you just witnessed the miracle of slightly increased kidney function.","Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little..."
Maybe we should pass this file over to another doctor.,And the next one too?,"Okay. If you cant get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your WiFi?"
"I'm sorry. I've hired a grief counselor whom I'm sure none of you will see and I'm offering time off, which I'm sure none of you will take. But just know it's available. Long pause","Polyserositis fits. Start her on indomethacin. He heads for his office, followed by Cuddy.","Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I dont think thats what they need right now."
If you'd rather not deal with this case!,I'm fine. Despite what Wilson will say.,I would rather not.
He hasn't come to you?,Pretty sure he has mah-jongg Tuesday mornings. I assume he thinks I will work through this better if I don't have to keep flicking his wings off my shoulder.,"Yeah, hes made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him."
You didn't Even have an inkling?,I know his fantasy football team cratered. Figured he'd gotten over it.,"Of course you didnt, he said little idea?"
Well! Sorry for your loss.,Thanks. But it's not my loss.,How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
Then I'm sorry you don't think it is. She leaves and Foreman and Thirteen come in from the conference room,Patient's membranes aren't gonna heal themselves.,"Uh, you know, Im not really around that much."
Taub went to run the treatment. We'd like to go see Kutner's parents.,I'll join you. He takes a Vicodin.,Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go.
Wish we did. We all,"It was his name. He was conflicted, didn't know where he fit in, being ripped out of his world and stuck into yours.",Because! Because I was sad.
We encouraged him to hold onto his heritage.,It's hard to still be Lawrence Choudhary when Everyone sees you as Kutner.,He came to us from White Harbor.
It was his idea to take our name.,Then you should have said no.,The ManyFaced God was promised a name.
Then you should have said no. House.,"All his Anglo name gave him was the illusion that he was someone he wasn't. You were being emotional, not rational. You didn't understand him.","Its a nickname, Ill explain later."
"We loved that boy, you son of a bitch.",You wanted to make him happy by shutting out his pain.,Came back with a bastard boy.
House! Go back to the hospital.,I'm sorry about your son.,Thank you.
"Indomethacin had no effect. She's still in pain. Rules out polyserositis. I ran a hormone panel on Eddie. His prolactin's above normal. Means he's actually improving. Body chemistry changes for all sorts of reasons stress, fear! Why not love? But maybe he's going into some sort of remission/",You haven't asked if I learned anything relevant from the Kutners.,Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
"If you had, I'm sure you would have mentioned it.",Or you're afraid there is something relevant. Which would mean you could have saved him.,"Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice."
I don't buy that suicide is always a cry for help. Sometimes you just don't want help.,Good thing you got some. Or you'd have tried again and gotten it right.,"Youre right, Im the problem, Im the one that needs help."
She doesn't have Wegener's. Kidney function's normal. It's not byssinosis. It's not mitral valve stenosis. Nothing fits.,"If it doesn't fit any diagnosis, it just leaves one diagnosis.","Sure, you want to go upstairs?"
"If it doesn't fit any diagnosis, it just leaves one diagnosis.",I'm Dr.,Or its resolved.
You wanna give me a heart attack?,It's only dangerous if your heart is normal size. But since all the,"Ugh, I feel like Im gonna have a heart attack."
Are you serious?,No.,"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
How could she be! The windpipe thing?,That was real.,Isnt she a pip?
We haven't been this close for years. I wanted to hang on to that. Ow!,"Oh, please. People hate reruns.",Were really close.
It's my leg. I swear this is real!,"What, you pinky swear or you just plain swear? Because","No, that part is real."
How can she fake that? He pulls back Charlotte's sheet. Her left lower leg is much smaller than the right.,She can't.,"In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet."
Her left lower leg is much smaller than the right. She can't.,"So, what can shred an epiglottis and make muscle disappear?",Well what if somebody steals something?
Mr. and Mrs. Kutner. They caused Kutner's death. Why not Charlotte's?,Mourning period's over.,Howard and Bernadettes van.
So what now? You gonna insult your way through his Rolodex till you find someone with an answer?,I've been polite to the friends I've called. All of whom were useless.,"What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?"
They weren't useless. They just didn't know anything more than we did.,"Tomato, tomah-to.","Yeah, were better off without them."
"MS. Weakens myelin sheath, compromises nerve conduction. I'm talking about Charlotte, the one who's still alive.","to Foreman and Thirteen You two, stick her in an MRI.",He cut off his ear.
"to Foreman and Thirteen You two, stick her in an MRI. Confirm MS. to Taub And you, run the echo on Eddie that you're planning to do behind my back to see if his heart's improving.",Did you let me hire a pervert?,"Meredith, what are you doing?"
Did you let me hire a pervert?,Kutner's police background check from when he started. He was charged with indecent exposure.,"No! Hey, you know what? Im sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with..."
"Kutner streaked at the Penn-Dartmouth football game. Precisely the kind of thing you'd expect him to do. It's okay. You should be upset. He thought like you, pushed boundaries like you","If he thought like me, he would know that living in misery sucks marginally less than dying in it.","Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that hed better come up here and apologize."
"For the record, I'm uncomfortable violating a dead colleague's dignity.",It's only violating it if you find something. Good to see you.,Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
What are we looking for?,He was hiding. Why?,What do we got?
Shame? Fear? Are you okay? It's okay not to be okay.,reading a card in a trophy case Colonial Warrior Blaster. Number One One. He spent months tracking this down. He had passions.,"Right. Thats your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but youve forgotten what it means. Someone whos forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
He was obviously in pain. Does it really matter why?,He hung the bad with the good.,His feelings needed to be hurt.
"Here's how we're going to handle this, House. We're going to leave here and go to the closest bar and drink and tell stories about the time Kutner almost blew up an OR. And pass out in our own sick. Sound like a plan?",What am I missing? to Wilson You've got that look. You figured this out.,"Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on."
You're not here because you care about Kutner. You're here because it's a mystery. You're here for the puzzle.,What if I didn't miss anything 'cause there's nothing to miss? He didn't kill himself. He was murdered.,It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about.
Autoimmne hepatitis? Did you page Foreman?,Took up Cuddy's offer of time off. Normal thyroid means no hepatitis.,"Well, if I get lucky, I dont want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs."
"Could be Amyloidosis. Amyloid buildup hits the organs, tissue",Her muscles wouldn't have atrophied. You run the echo on the husband?,"OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or Im gonna lose MY FRICKIN MIND!"
Heart's still failing. The improvement was only temporary.,"I prefer the less subtle answer You were right, House.",You forget how many great songs Heart had.
House! it was a suicide. The police have already investigated.,"They investigated what they saw, not what they didn't saw. Talk to friends, classmates, pizza delivery guy. And draft Foreman. He can make calls through his tears.",Dont be silly.
He can make calls through his tears. No.,"Is that No, I'm not calling my boyfriend, who apparently called my boss instead of me to say he wasn't coming in?","Cut! Alex, remember youre supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?"
We all want to know why Kutner did it but we're not gonna waste time chasing ghosts.,You're not remotely curious?,We all know the reason.
Only why a Man who embraces the rational is suddenly pursuing the irrational.,She could have alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency. Run her AAT proteins.,"No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?"
IT's been trying to close out Kutner's email account. Apparently someone's still logged onto it.,It wasn't hard to figure out that his password was Kutner. He did what they tell you not to do.,Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?
He wasn't murdered.,But his parents were. And the guy who killed them is coming up for parole.,Hes not going to be a murderer.
He's coming up for parole. He's not out on parole.,Kutner testified at Every one of his hearings. The guy wouldn't be the first to see the clock ticking.,"If youre right, he must not be allowed to escape."
He was killed by his own gun.,"Which he bought years ago, obviously for self-defense.",Hes dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
In the temple. Cops found residue.,Right. The murderer would nEver try to make it look like suicide. That would be unethical. Cuddy stands up to leave You haven't asked about my Patient.,Nobody cares. Do you know how long its been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
You're waiting on an AAT protein results.,Means you checked up to see that I'm still on it.,You could put your cell phone in it instead.
voice over She's stable. But whatEver was left of her liver is definitely shot now. And there's no change in Eddie.,"So, thanks to her idiotic move, she's dead in 24 hours if she doesn't get a new liver.","Well, the next time you watch it, Im the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious."
It was selfless. She loves him.,How does that disagree with what I just said?,"Oh, how kind of her."
"No diagnosis, no liver. No liver, no living.",What do you know. It is myelofibrosis. He starts writing on the paper. Says so right here. Who wants to tell Cuddy?,"I have no idea, but Xrays alone could be a couple hundred dollars."
How Many times have you lied to the transplant committee?,Just twice.,Thousands of times!
How Many times has it worked?,I don't quite see how that's relevant. His pager goes off. He checks it. Cheese it. It's the coppers.,"Alalright, llook you guys, this is the best relationship Ive been in."
grabbing his pager We're not just going to leave them to die while you fixate on Kutner.,"Technically, he's not our Patient. So I'm really only leaving her to die.","Kurt, put him down this instant."
We've already explored the usual options. Shouldn't we at least explore unusual ones?,Absolutely. He goes to his desk and picks up his phone Don't worry. This is why God gave me two ears.,"Look, Im not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?"
Kutner would say we should just come clean with Cuddy.,"Wow. If only he were here to say that. I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, Hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting","Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history."
"Wow. If only he were here to say that. I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, Hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting",Need an incurable roMantic to talk to an incurable roMantic.,"He still wont shag the old lady, huh?"
Kutner wasn't murdered.,You deduced that by removing your sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?,Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
Suicide means you could have helped him. Murder lets you off the hook.,shows Cameron two films.,Killing you would send your brother a message.
Partial won't be enough. She needs a whole liver and he'd nEver survive the procedure.,"Nice symmetry, huh?",How will she serve him?
gets it He dies on the table and you give her his whole liver.,"If he's gonna do this, he's gonna do this for love. I though he should talk to someone who spoke the language.","Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?"
You can't do the transplant.,Only if he said no. But your urgent hovering means he said yes.,"Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldnt."
His fingers have nodules. I think his doctors misdiagnosed him.,Or you sprinkled too much wishful thinking in your tea.,This will just be my batch.
Obese Man with lung cancer Two easy explanations for his heart failure. Nodules can mean something else. Something curable.,Go back to the ER. My thanks to you and your cold feet.,Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brothers head.
"What's going on? I'm giving you a shot at a cool result. Better yet, a chance to prove other doctors idiotic.",Except you're wrong.,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you."
You figure that out by taking off your sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?,The guy who killed Kutner's parents died of an aneurism two months ago.,"Well, you can kinda tell from the voice."
Kutner hid from Everyone. You didn't get a chance to save him. No one did. Run the tests. Find out if you have a chance to save Eddie.,Bad news.,Ahhhhgaaaahhh. Eddie whatre you still doin here?
But how come I was getting better without the medicine?,Your emotional state bumped your Catecholamines which helped raise your prolactin.,"Hold on, Hollys coming back here?"
My emotional state?,"Three months of treatment, you'll be back to your buff, Parkseled self.",I dont know how to help you.
I don't want the treatment. Do the transplant.,But you'd be trading the certainty that you'll live for the uncertainty that she'll live.,Do you want me to beg for my life?
I was ready to die anyway.,Now you get to be nicer to your next wife.,I wasnt ready for it.
You're basically asking us to commit murder.,I was yesterday too.,"If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it."
There's a difference when he has 20 years to live instead of two days.,Not really. Not legally.,I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. Its this.
"That's your way of convincing us to do this, by saying it's no more immoral?",The idiot is gonna do this with or without us. This way we can protect the organ.,"No! Were gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?"
We should be protecting him.,"So we strap him to the bed, wait till his wife dies?",You said he was here to protect us.
She spiked a fEver. LP shows her white cells through the roof. She's infected Everywhere.,I should fire you.,"OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!"
Infection means we have a new clue.,And a full two or three hours to figure it out.,"Oh, still here."
Sarcoidosis hits the spleen and the liver.,She would have lung issues.,Im not understanding the confusion.
Scleroderma inflames the tissue.,No skin or GI pRoblems. He sighs What is she hiding?,What are you drawing over there?
You don't know that,angry Either we have all the clues and we're idiots or we don't have all the clues.,Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
"Possible exposure, people, places.",Both.,Well heres what Ive been doing around here.
"Possible exposure, people, places. Both.",Bad lie. Did you really think the beaches in Hawaii were just like the beaches in Rio? The disease bearing sand flies are completely different.,"Okay, for next time, what do you say?"
She's nEver been to Rio.,Who'd you go with?,Ive never met her.
Why are you doing this?,I don't actually need to know who it was.,"Look, its obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution."
"turns her head toward Eddie, slowly Last year! It was nobody you know. Rio was supposed to be ours. I got tired of waiting. I'm so sorry.",to Taub on his way out Start her on antimony and have Cuddy find her a liver.,"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together."
I was wrong about you.,"No, you weren't.","Fine. I had reservations about you, too."
You're in pain.,And you're roManticizing. Again.,"Well, it just hurts so bad."
You worked with him Every day for two years and you nEver saw this coming.,No one saw it coming.,Youve tried to work with him before.
"But you see Everything coming. This has nEver been about what you missed. This is about why you missed it. You're terrified that you're losing your gift, losing! who you are. And I'm terrified of what you'd do then.","Unless you feel there's more to do here to cure me, don't you have a funeral to go to?","Ah. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know whats invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know whats gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, youre going to make me say it. All right, I am so proud of all of you. Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... Im sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?"
He's seen three different specialists.,Interesting. Almost as interesting as you trying to step into Kutner's shoes just days after he stepped out of them.,"Oh, alright, thats it, now I have to go see him."
"If he was trying to fake an illness, why would he consent to be seen by the best diagnostician in the country?",Now who's trying to get her hybrid waxed?,I cant because that was a lie.
That's normal. Sometimes this test causes vertigo He turns toward Cameron and vomits and nausea.,Cameron just brought me a case.,"Oh, I tasted Bens milk, and Ross freaked out."
"Cameron is happy in the ER. There's no way she wants her nose back on your grindstone. he orders Egg white omelet, no bacon, whole wheat toast.",I say it's not my grindstone she's after. And not her nose she wants on it. She and Chase are practically living together. What did you just order?,"Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know youre mad, but I just want to say Im sorry. II was a total jerk. Completely oover the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Yknow? I mean, yknow how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?"
What did you just order? An omelet.,Since when do you pass on the swine? And wheat toast? Might as well eat a sheet of sandpaper.,"Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! Im an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!"
Yes. But I don't like eating the same thing two days in a row.,Your bro's nurse not lovin' the love handles?,"Certainly. Its not like I have to moderate my food intake because Im planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!"
"I'm just not in the mood for bacon. And you're obviously trying to avoid talking about Kutner. Which is odd, because you spent a whole week obsessing about why",He's no longer on my team. I'm sorry he's no longer on my team. Nothing else to talk about.,"Oh hi! Hi! Yknow, we were just talking about bacon."
You're wearing the watch he gave you for Secret Santa.,"displaying the watch Five functions, including a stopwatch to time how long it takes you to ask me if I'm okay.",and that is the watch that you are going to wear?
You gonna order?,Not hungry. He takes a Vicodin.,"So, are we ready to order?"
And you know this because,"She changed her shoes. If he was faking, he'd have vomited on the other side of the bed.","No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler."
Could also be our only warning before a massive stroke.,Do a Holter and a carotid Doppler.,"So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time."
No sight of heart or arterial pRoblems but he's been hiccupping on and off for over a week.,"Nice. I'm hooked. You can get back to your shift at the ER. Except, as far as the ER is concerned, you're on vacation, right?","I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears."
I postponed a trip because I'm concerned about the Patient.,"Explains why you ditched Chase and came to differentials, not why you ran the tests.",Call us when you get there so we know youre OK.
You told me to.,"Well, I'm not your boss, as you usually take great pleasure in pointing out. Hey, you don't still have the hots for me, do you?","Really, cos you dont look like youre swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home."
I care about the Patient and I care about the people who work on your team. They've been through a lot lately. I just thought I,Was Florence Nightingale. Yeah. You're gonna nurse us back to spiritual and mental oneness. That would make sense if we were having this conversation a week ago.,And its because we care about you that weve decided we have to speak up.
"Think what you want that I'm here to get a job, that I'm here to wrap you in swaddling clothes.","The pRoblem is, I think neither. Because neither makes sense. The only thing that does! doesn't.","Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. Theres a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. Ill wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money."
Pathological hiccups plus inability to balance. Go.,What she said.,I was just looking over the paperwork.
Brain would connect the two.,"It could, if Cameron hadn't already CT'd his head. Empty as her boyfriend's calendar.",Why did that come into your brain?
What does this have to do with Chase? Nothing.,at the same time Not sure yet.,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, its the Visa card people."
It's possible it's not connected to a protest. MS wouldn't show on the CT and his name's Swenson. Scandinavians have an increased susceptibility to MS.,Better theory than he's faking it. The clogs have it. Do a lumbar puncture to confirm MS.,Well who do you have?
I guess we'll just continue to twiddle our thumbs.,"God, I hope that's a euphemism.","Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens."
How am I supposed to do a lumbar puncture on a Patient with intractable hiccups?,I'm trying to figure out what that could be a euphemism for. Taub sighs You'll find a way. Cameron sighs,"You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well."
He leaves Dr. House?,"Sorry, I'm just the Zone delivery guy.","By the way, do you know whos moving back into town?"
"I'm, uh, Doug Swenson's wife.",His history said the environmental kamikaze was single.,Youre Robb Starks wife.
"He, um, he pRobably didn't want me to worry. He told me he was in jail with some of the other protesters.",Yeah. No worries there.,"Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the brides maid and a bucket of strawberries."
He's in jail a lot. Not so often in the hospital. I searched his e-mail and I found the referral to you yesterday.,You must really love your husband and travel by rickshaw.,Do you know where I can find him?
"Uh, I had to find somebody to take care of our four-year-old son. Doug's all right, isn't he?",I have no idea.,"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?"
The doctor in the office next to yours said that you might be here.,I got it figured out.,"Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, theyre almost pure protein."
That mean we don't need to do the LP.,indicating Cameron I was talking to her. You're not Even supposed to be here.,Right. So all we need is to
You want us to stop or not?,"What? Oh, I don't care what you do with him. You're not doing a favor for a doctor in Philly. You're doing a favor for an oncologist in North Jersey.","In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?"
I'm spying on you for Wilson?,"Spying, preemptive grief counseling.","Uh, hello! Whos snooping on who now?"
Wilson sees you ten times more than I do. He's a better liar and he wouldn't have to cancel a vacation to do it.,Good points. Also doesn't explain the diet.,"Im not going along with some lie you made Ross, No Im just gonna be honest with him."
What does any of this have to do with my husband?,Nothing. Meet Mrs. Environmental Nutbag. Or did you keep your maiden name?,"Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!"
Or did you keep your maiden name? He's married?,Yep. Got a kid too. Double threat. Eco-freak and deadbeat dad.,"Hey, did you two get married?"
It's torticollis. Reaction to the chlorpromazine.,It's not just a spasm. It's swollen. He pushes on the bulges which make a slight crinkly sound. Crunchy.,"Fine, if Zacks going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern."
"Most likely, it was there all along. We just didn't notice it till the other symptoms made it worse.","So, what causes loss of balance, pathological hiccups, and a hole in his Gloria Steinem?","No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it."
He was protesting a lumber mill last fall. Sarcoid's been linked to pine forests.,No. His A.C.E. lEvels were normal.,I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards.
"Progressive systemic sclerosis. Guy practically lives in industrial waste sites. If a solvent got absorbed through his lungs, caused an autoimmune firestorm!",Start him on IV methyl-prednisolone for systemic sclerosis. Do a full work-up to confirm.,"Come on, on your feet, now."
Do a full work-up to confirm. By myself?,Without yourself. to the team Grab a bat. to Cameron Grab some pine. Time to bring in the first string.,"Okay, good, cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own."
Time to bring in the first string. Why?,You obviously want to be here. I can't figure out why. I wanna see where you go when you can't be here. He watches her leave.,"Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?"
"Come on in, House. He opens the door Because who else is it going to be at 1030 at night? And, no thanks, I already ate.",Didn't ask you to dinner.,Sheldons bedroom. There is a knock on the door.
"But you were going to. And, when I explained that I'd eaten hours ago, you were going to move on to your real entre, rifling through my kitchen.",Hmmm.,"What? II bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!"
"Or it means it's late, I'm tired, I know you're here to advance some paranoid theory based on a single egg white omelet, and I'd like to get it over with so we can both go to sleep.",Your single omelet theory conveniently overlooks the grassy knoll you had for lunch today. Vegetable and grain gag-athon.,"It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty."
The Warren Commission found no evidence of a second lunch. Possibly because it was stolen from the doctor's lounge.,You're not getting any fatter. Your medical records were clean.,"Thats ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch."
You checked my ?,"You're alone tonight, so it's Kutner.",Of course I checked it.
How could Kutner have any conceivable,"Your Patients live, your Patients die. You float above it all like a medical colossus. But a fellow doctor dies!","Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost."
"That's brilliant. Kutner was a wake-up call that if I didn't eat healthier, I might kill myself.",Mortality is mortality.,Michael was on an eggyolk diet.
And! Ice cream is ice cream. He takes a half gallon out of the freezer Full fat content. Quadruple fat content. He shows House a package of bacon. Next he hands House a bag of Parkps from the shelf above the refrigerator.,Stuff you haven't eaten just proves you haven't eaten it.,"Joeys apartment. Joey enters carrying a tub of ice cream. He sets it on the table, takes off his jacket and struggles with the drawer. It cannot be opened."
What are you doing to him?,I assume they were checking for vascular pulsations. Either it's negative or he's a big wuss.,What am I making him by the way?
It's not a tumor or an aneurism.,winces and hold the phone away from his ear Metabolic bone disease?,"Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here."
"But the bone covering might not be! If it's osteomyelitis, an infection eating away at his periosteum",That explains the pain.,"Rajesh, Ive had the privilege of working alongside you for many years."
Cameron's already done a full set of lower-body x-rays.,The infection obviously flared. Do 'em again. He closes his phone to the sound of Doug still screaming.,"Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguires prostate sonogram?"
"Brittle bones wouldn't cause hiccups. Plus, we'd have seen abnormal coloring in the sclerae.",drinking something to wash down the pill Which leaves cancer.,You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
Since when does bone cancer cause hiccups? He plays with the empty pill bottle.,Which means it's not bone cancer.,But your divorce isnt even final yet.
"House is right. It'd be hard to find a guy outside Chernobyl who'd been exposed to more carcinogens. Pesticide plants, nuclear waste sites.",Tell Chase to repair the break. You two prep him for chemo.,"Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl."
You want to blast him with chemo for a cancer we don't Even know he has?,Nope. I wanna blast him for with chemo for a cancer that explains the symptoms.,Im saying we should go scorched earth on that guys face.
Cameron isn't on the case anymore. Huh.,"Still enjoying your day off, I see.",Theyve arrested Monica.
Why are you prepping him for chemo?,The more interesting question is why do you care?,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you dont like the guy Rachels dating?"
You're not Even sure that it's,"What I mean is, why do you care from here? You can monitor the Patient from home. What's the difference between here and home?",Its so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
dripping with false sincerity You're not at my home. normal voice This has nothing to do with,Any other differences?,"I sense thats not sincere, although I have no idea why."
You are wrong.,You decided that his single drawer of clothes is one drawer too Many.,"No, no youre wrong about this."
long pause He's gonna ask me to marry him. I was looking for some thick socks. Found the ring.,And you want to say no. So I circle right back to his single drawer of clothes,"Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mixup at the jewelry store, the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Im gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange Im willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew."
"I don't want to say anything. I don't want him to ask. Not now. Kutner! We're all a little freaked out. We go home, we just wanna hug someone. We just wanna know Everything's gonna be okay. I don't want him to propose just 'cause he's scared.",Oh.,He... hes gonna propose?
Her breasts are really tender.,You guys have a hot tub?,"Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there."
You guys have a hot tub? No.,She must go to the gym a lot.,"True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a mnage with sexy goth girls."
Not in years.,Then maybe when you travel on business you zip on down to that complimentary hotel spa.,"Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total."
Then maybe when you travel on business you zip on down to that complimentary hotel spa. No.,"Sorry, did you just say yes?",Then well go to a hotel.
He doesn't. What's wrong with her?,Sorry. I'm sure she's got a medical crisis. And I need more time to figure out some leading questions for your wife.,"Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok?"
What's going on with Cameron?,She doesn't want back on my team and she doesn't want to jump me.,So how are things going with Paul?
Okay. She starts to leave.,"Wha, wha, wha, what?","Ok, well then lets leave like right now."
"This isn't a medical crisis, is it?",Could be.,"Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?"
He's bleeding out.,Means it's gotta be cancer.,I dont know.
"It's gotta be, except it's not. The biopsy was negative.",Biopsies can be wrong. Symptoms can't.,Darryl is a jerk.
All signs point to cancer but you can't blast a cancer you can't find.,Sure you can. Prep him for total body irradiation.,Hey. You got a minute?
You do realize that's insane.,Not unless you think the cancer's clEverly hiding outside his body.,You have to agree with me.
"And if he doesn't have cancer, we could cause one or destroy his immune system altogether. The guy could die from an infected toenail.","getting in the elevator You'd rather do nothing, just let him die on his own?",What? You bet Id lose a nail?
That's like pouring gasoline on a fire. At least total body irradiation's an actual treatment.,thinks His idea is better. Pour away.,Define scorched earth policy.
thinks His idea is better. Pour away.,I lost my mojo.,Every idea is better than this idea.
Have you retraced your steps? Does your cleaning lady check your pockets before,I was clueless about Kutner. I was wrong about Cameron. Taub just came up with an idea that I should have seen long before he did.,"Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush."
No one saw anything coming with Kutner. You hardly Ever see Cameron anymore. And you hired Taub to come up with ideas that you wouldn't have come up with.,And I have no idea why you're eating carrots.,"Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart."
And I have no idea why you're eating carrots. Good.,I'm losing my mind. All you got to say is good?,Because its orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
voice over Nothing on the echo. We drew a troponin lEvel. No signs of myocardial ischemia. All the tests were normal.,Loss of balance.,"Wait, well whwhwhwhere is she?"
"That's perManent and risky. We don't Even know what, if anything, is wrong with his heart.","Redo all the tests. In the meantime, open him up, put in a defibrillator so he can live long enough for you to finish the tests. The team leaves.",Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
"Redo all the tests. In the meantime, open him up, put in a defibrillator so he can live long enough for you to finish the tests. The team leaves.","Balance, organs, nerves, lungs, bones, heart.","And of course, crotchless panties."
"Playing $25,000 Pyramid Things you use to make bratwurst.",sits on steps with a sigh There's no sign of infection. It's not a metabolic or autoimmune disease. It's definitely not cancer. I think.,"So, were about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body."
Definitely not cancer.,indicating the vending maParkne Aren't you going to pick?,"Hi, hi, Im Ross Geller."
I'm thinking. Is there a ticking clock?,You already put your money in. You nEver do that until you decide.,All the alarm bells are kind of going.
That's very observant of you. Too bad you distracted me. Now I'm! thinking I might change my mind.,There's nothing healthy in that maParkne.,You distract me.
"No, there's not. He makes a selection.",Gummi bears. You hate gummi bears.,"Thats him, the one who picks."
People can change.,"No. And more importantly, I hate them.",But change is a part of life.
"smiling slightly Oh, fine. Then I won't offer you any.",You Manipulative bitch.,What about if I tell you the things I dont want?
"Screwing with you. It needed to be done. After Amber died, I withdrew, tried to change Everything, hoping I'd sort it out. Find some deeper truth. It was a mistake. I should have gone back to normal, to here and now, because that's all we can Every really count on. Things need to get back to normal in your life. And! what could be more normal than me screwing with you and you figuring it out?",admiringly You Manipulative bitch.,"Closure, thats what it is."
"It means, Even if we figure this out, you'll have to stop protesting anywhere not near a hospital.",entering Hi! Got a few questions.,"Oh its nothing, it just says that you cant sue the city if you scrap your knee or yknow, get your head blown off."
"Uh, we're about to start doing",A hopefully pointless medical procedure.,"Yeah, weve been meaning to do that."
"No, we live in an apartment.","A window box, then.",Are you the roommate?
"A window box, then. No.",grasping at a straw Potted plants?,Just the one window?
Nothing. The commercial growers,"Yeah, yeah. They're evil. Yeah, got it.",The current harvest?
"House, I really don't think we have time for this.",to Taub Your marriage sucks.,"Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while."
to Taub Your marriage sucks. Thank you.,All marriages suck. to Doug and Franni Your marriage sucks.,Youre an even better husband.
I love her.,He loves a tree in Oregon more than he loves you. But he can't have sex with it. Unless it's that slutty oak outside Portland.,"We need to fight, but we dont need to die."
You wanna get to your point?,"She's had enough. She's gonna leave. Or maybe she's jut not putting out. WhatEver. You gotta make it right, right away. You gotta compromise that precious flower principle.","All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert."
long pause Once. to Franni Three weeks ago. Our anniversary. I missed the dinner to be at that rally. You planned it for months. You were mad. Really mad. I bought you flowers. I brought them home. You were gone. So was your suitcase. I tossed them and bought you the earrings.,"Roses? Doug nods. Yes. You have sporotrichosis. It's an infection from the thorn of the rose which, by any other name, is still a cheap marital aid.","Okay, I understand everyones a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff."
The flowers are what gave me,Lesion on your eighth cranial nerve knocks out your balance.,I dont really like flowers.
Please tell us that this is good news.,It's good news for him. It's good news for future generations. It's crappy news for you. He's gonna be fine. And he'll nEver doubt himself again.,"I hope its good news, because Ive got nothing but disappointment in here!"
There you go.,Damn.,Is that bothering you?
He almost died. He can't take a few days at home with his family?,People only change after trauma if they wanted to change before the trauma. Or if they've watched too Many afterschool specials.,"He needs to go right now, and youre his emergency contact."
You talking about Chase?,I'm talking about you. You lost husband number one. No surprise that the death of a colleague would make you question another long-term lease.,"Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg."
I told you I nEver wanted to dump Chase.,Absolutely.,You didnt want me before.
voice over House. House. I know you're not asleep.,without opening his eyes That insight would be a lot more impressive if you weren't just a product of my exhausted brain.,"Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep?"
Aren't you curious about why I'm here?,Curious why no French maid's outfit. No spanky pants.,"Hey honey, I dont think we should push him."
"I'm a hallucination, not a fantasy.",It's insomnia. Four nights without REM sleep can cause,"No, Im not a dream."
That might explain why you're hallucinating. Doesn't explain why you're hallucinating Wilson's dead girlfriend.,PRobably just my secret and very unconscious desire to get Wilson into my bedroom.,"Well, perhaps youre obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman."
Or maybe your guilt over Kutner's suicide reminds you how guilty you felt about me.,"Who cares why you're here. A decent night's sleep, you won't be.","Noo! Maybe! I, I dont know. Ross, I still cant forgive you for what you did, I cant, I just, but sometimes when Im with you I just, I feel so..."
Need some coffee?,Addictive substances are no substitute for nature's healing balm. He takes a Vicodin Make this fast. I need to sleep.,Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
Deaf 14-year-old started hearing imaginary explosions.,"Exploding head syndrome. Cool. Well, obviously his brain knows how to hear.",Can you ever feel your ears?
Damn imaginary pen.,glances at her then back at the chart Mom's signature's on Everything. Did Dad die?,"Yknow what, Im, Im gonna spend some alone time with the pen."
"No, doubt it. He was a sperm donor. Medical records couldn't be cleaner.",So we're left with temporal lobe seizure.,"Well, thats because of a lot of"
Someone at the wrestling meet would have noticed a seizure.,Could have just looked like a bad shot to the leg. Put him in the seizure lab. See if his head blows up all over again.,All right. Lets move on. Lets move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
You're going to ignore your own subconscious? Gonna be the limp leading the blind.,I need a scrip for sleeping pills.,"I speak sign language, I dont read minds."
Why did he close that file?,Wedding in two weeks? I'd say you were pregnant but I don't think Chase's body is mature enough to produce sperm.,I expect its cause he wanted somebody to find it.
Drugs with no lecture? He wants you out.,Interesting case?,"Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I dont know what he told you, but you cant stay here."
Possible prostate cancer came into the ER. Pencil cup.,Ho! No wonder his prostate's enlarged. It's full of pool cues and cigars. The folder holds flyers from various venues.,"Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, its a pencil cup."
Chase's best Man doesn't get here till the day of the wedding so I asked Wilson to throw his bachelor party.,No retired ministers available to plan it?,"Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party."
"Chase doesn't want some big, raucous party.","So she says. Luckily, there are people in this world ready to stand up for what's right.","Well, I dont want to go to a party."
"No, no, no. I don't want I don't want you to",Listen. There are two things I do well. Bachelor parties rank! towards the top.,"No, no, no, I dont want to."
"Doctors, doctors. He can't see. One of his eyes.",The limp leading the blind.,Not my eyes!
Is that supposed to mean something?,So exploding head syndrome plus vision loss.,What is that supposed to mean?
We should do an angio,grabbing the bottle Knock yourselves out.,We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play reallife Operation.
C-reactive protein. I noticed in his file it was slightly elevated. I figured the stress of the seizure lab would drive inflammation Even higher. Lead to optic neuritis.,That's a lot clearer than the limp leading the blind.,"Hey, so hows the direct mail business going?"
It was just a glimmer. I couldn't put it into words.,It was a long shot. I don't Even remember the c-reactive protein lEvel.,"Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?"
Obviously you do. You just don't know it.,How high is K2?,"Yes. You alone do, actually."
I don't know.,"Me neither. But I read a book about it years ago. Fierce, sexy Sherpa on the cover, bending over","Hi. Im good. Really good. Well, I dont know why I said really good. Im just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really."
"Fierce, sexy Sherpa on the cover, bending over 28,251 feet.",Cool. An all-access pass to my own brain.,"She, she is remarkable."
Go play the kid some music.,Why?,"Oh, come on!"
"House, what are you doing?",What does it look like I'm doing? Fighting the power.,"Yeah, Ive, Ive outlived a few of my doctors, too."
"You're an ass. She reaches over to turn off the music. Seth stops her and signs. He says he feels the vibrations in his abdomen, but not his hands. What does that mean?",removing the glasses and turning off the boom box It's a new symptom. Neuropathy.,"Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!"
Thought you were gonna get some sleep.,Case got interesting.,"Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep."
Case got interesting.,Like the zoo. Except you can bang on the glass as much as you want.,"Kay, well, you had that interesting thing."
How did you know about the neuropathy?,Good question.,"I wasnt making a joke, I was merely stating fact."
Enough with the riddles.,Tell me about it.,Ive decided I dont like riddles.
Think wrestling record.,Juggling.,Thats a very good record.
Could be increased ICP from a brain tumor.,That we missed on the head CT?,"They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andys play, they took mine."
Cutting weight for wrestling could have led to rhabdomyolysis.,He just went up a weight class three months ago.,That was to keep my muscles from sagging.
He just went up a weight class three months ago. Foreman's right.,"Actually, increased ICP could make sense.","And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California!"
You just said,I was processing.,"Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi."
It also puts a new symptom on the table.,His deafness. What if it was caused by NF2 cancer instead of his Parkldhood meningitis?,Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
So meningitis was a coincidence?,Or a byproduct of the cancer suppressing his immune system. MRI his head.,"I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
"If you're right about NF2, his deafness may be rEversible. I'll set it up and talk to the Patient.",You two! doing anything?,Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
"Imaging shows slightly elevated ICP, but no masses on or around the nerves. It's not cancer.",Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth ventricle could still indiCate a tumor.,She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to Kings Landing.
The fact that you sent me on a scouting mission No skirts.,You're not on the guest list. Bachelor parties are an ancient and sacred male rite of passage.,"Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before."
"Looking at the picture of a stripper Oh, God, not her.",She's the one that got me hooked in with Madoff.,"Hey listen man, about the stripper"
Taub's right. It's not cancer.,"Yeah, by all means, abandon a great diagnostic theory because it's difficult to prove. Do a biopsy. We need to take a better look at his fourth ventricle.","Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating."
Patient broke his nose years ago. Hospital could have done an MRI.,exhales Okay. He gathers up Seth's films.,"Its no surprise that your winning, cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team."
The main reason my third wife and I eloped was to avoid House's bachelor party. long pause Have you seen Caligula?,entering My Patient's brain now! versus three years ago. he puts films on the light board. See any difference? to Chase Is he telling you to avoid the party?,Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
I took an oath to do no harm.,Sure. Don't come. If you want your wedding vows to be meaningless.,You must release me from my oath.
This should be interesting.,You are going to commit to that one special Woman forEver.,"Oh, that could be interesting."
who has been studying the films through all this The wall of the fourth ventricle changed. It isn't bowed in the older scan.,"Evidence of NF2, right?","So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner."
"You'd need to do a brain biopsy to confirm. House takes the scans Uh, I'm not going to the bachelor party. Every time I go to one of your parties, I end up embarrassing myself in some new and unexpected way.",opening the door That whole thing with the duck was hardly unexpected.,"Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoevers willing to sleep with you."
I'm not going.,Okay.,"Oh, you know what?"
Do you know who we need? She and House are in the observation balcony That stripper you got for Wilson's bachelor party. You could do body shots right off her.,"Why go back to that well? In the nine years since Wilson's party, a whole new generation of hot girls have been abused by their stepfathers.",Now why dont we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.
She loved cats.,What made you remember the stripper loved cats?,Shes only a cat.
"on speaker. Ahem, House? You, uh, entertaining yourself up there?",turning on the intercom with his cane Just rehearsing for the revival of Evita. What'd you find?,"Ah, somebodys at the door on the ceiling."
He's going to go through life deaf.,He's okay with that.,"Oh, come on you guys thats funny!"
He has no idea what he's missing. His mom's a moron. He's gonna pay for her stupidity for the rest of his life? Are we okay with that?,thinks then turns on intercom Why are you closing? Supposed to put in a cochlear implant.,"Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, Oh that poor girl."
Wasn't in the paperwork.,"Really? Well, someone must have screwed up. I'll go track it down.",So weird that there is no paperwork.
I'll go track it down. I'll wait.,That's a great idea. Let the kid spend more time under anesthesia with his skull cracked open.,"You know what, let me give you a call right back."
Let the kid spend more time under anesthesia with his skull cracked open. I'll wait.,I have been known to lie to serve my own agenda. An implant does absolutely nothing to help me diagnose him.,"When your son returns, I will demand this murderers head."
Her son didn't want the implant.,"If he still doesn't want it, after having time to adjust, I'll take it out. I'll blind him too if he wants to experience that culture.","See, we knew it!"
Remove it now.,Kid's just had brain surgery. He's not stable.,"All right, if youre not going to remove it, Ill remove it for you."
"Understand, Dr. House? he's in a fog House. Focus. I need you to say you accept the arrangement.",No pRoblem. to Ellie You're not mad.,"Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this."
to Ellie You're not mad. I'm mad.,Not mad enough. You wanted your son to hear. You just didn't have the guts to make him get the implant.,"Hey, I dont understand why youre not upset with Amy."
Why did you do this?,Because he is ignorant and he's being raised by an idiot.,"No, lets just leave the lights on."
Not good enough. You always have,shouting My Patient is opting into a handicap! It's an insult to all the other gimps out there.,Oh. I get it. Youre trying to secure your place as head of the partyplanning committee. Youre just being selfish. And you slap like a girl.
Okay. But I'm still putting Foreman in charge of the case.,That's the arrangement? she nods slightly Okay.,You are not the manager.
You're okay with Foreman in charge? Who you calling? Oh! Right. You don't want to look like a lunatic.,"Yeah, about that!",You three are my search committee.
You think we did the wrong thing?,I'm not sure. they enter the elevator I'm not Even sure why we did it.,"Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing."
"Well, that argument you made to Cuddy sounded pretty good.","To you, maybe.","I tried, but he made a fairly wellreasoned argument."
"To you, maybe.",Huh. I figured by now you'd be at the board in your monocle and jodhpurs.,"Thats not how you see me, is it?"
Why did you do it?,"Why did I give a huMan being the power of hearing? You ask God the same question, he'll give you the same answer.",What a bad idea!
I agree. Taffy? She's stretParkng a long piece of pink taffy.,I agree.,"Taffy, really? Ive never had any."
Go ahead. Start him on ribavirin for Epstein-Barr.,Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you're in charge.,Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you're in charge.,Why aren't you in my office?,"All right, youre the boss."
Because I know what the word my means.,"I did something insane, and you're not all over me analyzing why.",Because I think it means more to you.
It was nice.,I gave that idiot an implant to prove to him what an idiot he's been. How is that nice?,"Uh Joey, were trying to dial down the crazy."
Doesn't sound like us.,I know.,"Okay, that sounds like us."
And you're okay with that?,opening the door What choice do I have? He and Amber leave,And how do you feel about that?
"Kid's dehydrated but stable. Thankfully, the fountain of whiz seems to have stopped for the moment.",Not before hosing Epstein-Barr off the table.,"I have to be honest with you Leonard, Im truly worried."
"Could be systemic autoimmune disease, sarcoido This tastes like! vodka.","Well, it would be stupid if it tasted like bourbon. That's the brown one.","Youre drinking wine, but you prefer ale!"
It is vodka?,Flash frozen in a secret process. Guy figured it out in his basement. He swallows a spoonful of yellow ice cream Limoncello. Genius.,"No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. Itll take two weeks."
"It happened at night. That was the clue. Night, recumbent body position, changes in BP","long pause It's his heart. He looks at the team. They're back to normal Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs.","Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! Youyouyou were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!"
"long pause It's his heart. He looks at the team. They're back to normal Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs.",What the hell just happened? Everything started to fade away.,"Last week. Im sorry, I shouldve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please dont be too disappointed."
You're getting better at focusing. Ignoring Everything that doesn't matter. She sees Chase approaParkng Uh-oh. He looks pissed. I think he might hit us.,Is your eyesight better than mine?,"Yeah, shes definitely going after Sheldon."
We need to talk about the bachelor party.,Excellent topic choice. Surgery's so boring and my lying to you is just so yesterday.,"So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?"
It's my fault for letting you talk me into the implant. Cameron is not going to be happy about this party.,"But you, on the other hand","Meredith, if you dont come to my party, you will be very, very sorry."
Plan on spending the rest of my life with Cameron.,So! I need to cancel the fart band?,Were gonna be together forever.
So! I need you to kidnap me.,Spoken like a true Aussie.,Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
snapping her fingers That's her name.,Sundae or bar?,Her names Debra.
Sundae or bar? Karamel.,With a K.,"Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?"
You still haven't slept?,burps loudly And then I have a clEver response. He opens another can.,Then Ive been up all night.
His heart's not fine.,The heart was fine during this test. The arrhythmia's hiding.,It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
Hashimoto's would explain the kid's urine and brain pressure. Treadmill.,"Or, the arrhythmia is hiding. We need to stress him. Put the Patient on a treadmill.","Sheldon, I cant believe Im saying this, but Im going to miss you."
The Patient just had brain surgery. A stress test could cause a brain bleed and kill him.,I value your opinion. I value rejecting your opinion.,"As a matter of fact, I did."
You're not doing this. You haven't been sleeping,Cuddy doesn't actually want you in charge. She just wants to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.,"Hmm, I just have never been in this room while youre awake."
"And if I let you risk our Patient's life testing an organ we already tested, we accomplish neither. Run a thyroid panel.",How do we get him into the stress lab without Foreman's sign-off.,Seriously? Youre calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what youre doing?
We could kill Foreman. House gives her a look. They pass a pretty blonde. Is she new?,Focus. The lab simulates stress. What if it's not simulated?,Someones in the kitchen with Dinah Sheldon?
We could tell him his girlfriend dumped him.,That's a tough sell since she nEver leaves the room for more than five minutes.,Of course we tell him shes a lesbian.
We could kill her. another look from House Or! Asthma meds. Force the heart to beat faster.,REvealing the arrhythmia. whispers Nice idea.,"Alright you know, why dont I just meet you upstairs."
"Actually, I think we just saved it. she turns to the monitor",Look at that. Arrhythmia.,You know what Pam just save it.
You were right about the heart. Should have listened to you.,"The correct phrasing would be, I should always listen to you.","Im sorry, I was aiming for your heart."
"Should do a VQ scan, see if his lungs are clear.",Go.,"No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!"
"Should do a VQ scan, see if his lungs are clear. Go.",You sure I did this at Wilson's party?,"Oh, it was okay I guess, wasnt a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it."
Last time you used grain alcohol instead of the Sambuca.,And it worked?,My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
shrugs This is why we're rehearsing. Ever wonder what's happening Every time our Patient gets sicker?,trying to stay ahead of the flames Not right now!,My parents are broke.
"First symptom, wrestling. Then, under the lights of the seizure lab",Are you going somewhere with this? Because this feels,"The Emergency Room, Joey is miming hockey pucks kitting foreheads."
"Just keep doing what you're doing. It helps. Then, under the stress of blindness! and post-op fEver. What do all the symptoms have in common?",has finally put out the fire.,"Okay, I didnt want to say anything cause I know you and Leslie have a little history."
Let's get our drink on.,Not before I've added chemical burns to this guy's cause of death.,"Come on, lets get a drink."
to Foreman Don't let House get him in too much trouble.,Allow me to welcome you to the best night of your life. He pours the flaming alcohol into a tumbler.,"I know you dont like Stuart being in the house, but the stores about to reopen, Im sure hell get back on his feet."
"A-huh. He covers the glass with his hand, putting out the flame. Then he drinks it in one swallow. House has him in a one-armed hug.","Now, ah, a few ground rules for the Evening.",He drank from Leonards glass.
Don't test them. House!,smiling as he leans past the glasses so he can see Wilson I knew you couldn't stay away.,Well I guess its okay to open one more if its part of a set.
waves House over with his patented two-finger gesture This is my apartment. You can't do this.,"Clearly, reality begs to differ.","Sheldon, honey, Ive told you, its a small apartment, you only have to knock one time."
Where's my furniture?,Out back somewhere.,But whats wrong with the furniture we have?
"You should be out there, enjoying the lap dances of your labors.",Eh. I kinda like it in here.,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
"sitting in the other end of the tub with a matParkng bottle Me too. To us, figuring out MS.",And the blindness and neuropathy and arrhythmia and anything else we did. they drink What exactly did my team do?,Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
"House, you in there?",Use the other bathroom. It's in the kitchen. Looks like a sink.,"Yes. Shes in the living room. Go, Ill wait here."
Chase went into anaphylactic shock from the stripper's body butter or something.,Is he okay?,Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
"One of the residents had an epi pen, so he's fine but we're taking him to the hospital to be safe.","quietly Okay. long pause I knew that Chase was allergic to strawberries, didn't I? Amber shrugs slightly That's why you wanted Karamel at this party.","Are we losing our jobs or not, David?"
I suggested Karamel 'cause she was great at Wilson's party.,I knew about her body butter. I knew about his strawberry allergy. I tried to kill Chase. Why would I do that? I don't want Cameron.,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor."
"You're not a big fan of other people's happiness, either.",Hello. pause You confirm? pause Thanks. hangs up That kid we saved! He's dying. It's not MS. We were wrong.,You just cant stand anyone else enjoying themselves cant you?
Turn around. You need to go to the hospital.,I need to sleep. He enters the apartment and closes the door in Amber's face.,"Oh no, I am mad at you."
I'm you. You can't just shut a door.,You tried to kill Chase. I need to push you back down. You're dangerous. his cell phone rings,"Im supposed to turn the lock when I leave, its part of my job."
It's the hospital.,Not answering. he answers on the second ring Hello?,Thats why youre not in charge Meredith.
"I'm here with your team, trying to sober them up so they can help treat your dying Patient.",Foreman's dying Patient.,Everyone else is too drunk.
"House, are you there?",It's not eosinophilic pneumonitis. I gotta crash.,"Are you there, sir?"
"House, don't hang up. We need your help.",I can't.,But can you help me get to my family?
We can solve this.,Good night. He hangs up and picks up his cane.,We can look into it.
Usually responds to corticosteroids and methotrexate. I'll start the meds.,I need sleeping pills. I was gonna hit up Wilson but he's not answering his phone.,"I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, its not me, right?"
"He must have left it in his pants. Which he wasn't wearing when the police found him trying to walk home! oddly, from his own apartment.",looks at Amber guiltily Pills.,"He carries it everywhere, its like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret."
"Your Patient's doing fine, thanks to your team.","It wasn't eosinophilic pneumonitis, was it?",Has anyone ever told you youre as boring as you are ugly?
"It wasn't eosinophilic pneumonitis, was it? Sarcoidosis.",Good.,"Well, Im not really in a sexy mood right now."
"House, please talk to me.",I haven't slept through the night since Kutner killed himself.,I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house.
"Are you going to ignore me all day, again? I help you.",You tried to kill Chase.,"Ugh, you know what?"
"Doing what you wanted. That's all, boss. She stands between him and the TV I exist.","No, you don't. I acknowledge my subconscious exists. Now go away.","Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified."
"in the hall when House opens his door Put the phone on the receiver, send the hookers home and get dressed. We've got a case.",I'm taking a personal day.,Rajs bedroom. Phone rings.
Twenty-one year old star of the New York Ballet collapsed on stage.,"I love ballet but, as someone may have mentioned, I'm taking a personal day.",I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
How long do you figure until I just! disappear?,following Foreman into the vestibule Hold on.,A quarters three months.
Any of that helpful? House?,STD?,"So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?"
We just said the tests were negative. You think we should!,No.,"Oh sure, we should see resultsWhoa!"
She's a dancer. What about dehydration?,What about a pulmonary contusion?,Its a common stripper problem.
What about dehydration?,B.U.N. and creatinine are elevated but within range!,"Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables."
"Hey. I'm just the irrational part of your brain but elevated means high, right? Dehydration could hide an infection.",Dehydration could hide an infection. Go treat her for the obvious. IV fluids and antibiotics for the pneumonia.,"Yeah, theres room in the bed by Sheldons feet."
The door was closed for a reason.,"Well, now it's open for a reason. We need to talk.","Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
He just told me I have kidney cancer.,Then you'll obviously need a moment to process.,"Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we werent very supportive."
Then you'll obviously need a moment to process. House!,I'm hallucinating.,"Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?"
I'm! I'll be right back. He follows House into the hall. House closes the office door.,"I need you to sit in on my differentials, double-check Everything I do.",Im going back to the room.
You can't treat Patients.,It's gotta be sleep apnea. I get a good night's sleep and I still feel exhausted. Lack of delta sleep can lead to hallucinations.,"I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this."
Do you have any other neurological symptoms?,I don't think so.,No. Im very comfortable.
I don't think so. Aphasia?,No.,"Yes, you are."
No. Memory loss?,Nope.,"Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?"
Nope. Irritability?,Yeah! That one!,"No, thats not what this feeling is."
at the same time You shouldn't be practicing. At least!,Enough! Both Amber and Wilson stop talking. Don't give me the look. I told you I was hallucinating.,"When you go to Emilys office to practice, youll see."
looking behind himself Who were you talking to?,Someone who's not actually here. Beyond that seems irrelevant.,Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
You know he's just going to keep asking.,Kutner.,Welldid you know he was gonna ask me?
Good choice. He feels bad.,You gonna help me or not?,He did pick a good one.
Sitting on the foot of the bed I know you're wrong about sleep apnea which means you know you're wrong about sleep apnea. You're scared. Tell him you're scared.,to Wilson Can't sleep with you here.,Look how nervous he gets!
Did it work?,Do you see someone standing beside me?,Did that do anything?
Do you see someone standing beside me? No.,"Then, no. Amber is standing next to him.",Is there someone here to see me?
entering Patient's not responding to the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.,So run a test to confirm it's pneumonia.,"Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute."
We can't do a bronc because her lungs are still collapsed.,Trans-tracheal aspiration.,From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
It's a great idea!,"Regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?",That is a great idea.
Somewhere between regular and you.,So what's the pRoblem?,"Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up."
So what's the pRoblem? Everything okay?,No.,"Okay, so whats the matter?"
SParkzophrenia usually Manifests younger.,That's why it's further down the list. We can confirm an infection with a simple blood test.,Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
"An infection can be treated. Cured. Means you still got a job. Means you still got a life. Doesn't make it a better idea, just a nicer one. This the rational you talking?",handing a blood drawing kit to Wilson Can't do this on my own.,"See uh, thatsthats actually what I wanted to talk to you about."
The ANA was negative.,Focus on the lungs.,Na Chuba negatorie Na!
You want us to ignore the fact that she's lost 80% of her skin?,"We know it's not lung cancer. It could be a liver tumor, eats through to the lungs. Get an ultrasound of her liver. If you find masses, get a biopsy.","Uh, a little, but more that shes covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on."
We can't just ignore the skin. It's obviously the most significant and dangerous symptom right now.,I don't think it is a symptom. I think we caused it.,"Mmm, and you know what that means."
By doing what?,I prescribed antibiotics.,By burning prisoners alive?
Toxic epidermal necrolysis. That's a one in a million reaction.,"Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm.",How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
"Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm.",Where the hell were you?,Thats the one.
I do have a practice.,Ballerina has toxic epidermal necrolysis.,Oh! Im a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Are you sure?,About to be.,The dog koira.
About to be. I'm sorry.,I feel guilty.,Im afraid I am.
"Any other doctor? Words can hurt, you know.",I have no reason to feel guilty. It doesn't make any sense. Unless there's something wrong in the limbic area of my brain.,Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?
Guilt as a symptom?,It's consistent with MS.,Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.
"It's consistent with MS. And, since the blood tests were negative! I have to apologize. If I feel better then you're right, I was feeling an emotion. If I feel nothing, it means my limbic brain is shot.",I'm Doctor House. Anyone explain to you your status?,She said she was going to give it to him right now.
sitting next to House She's half dead and she's wondering if she'll Ever plie again? Healthy priorities. Let the mocking begin.,I'm sorry.,"Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord?"
She pats him comfortingly on the leg Thank you?,thinks then shakes his head Nothing.,Forget her! You enjoy this!! Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.
Maybe you didn't mean it.,I meant it. Did you do a liver biopsy to confirm?,"Thats all, you didnt mean it?"
in the hall with Wilson Couldn't. The artificial skin was too thin. She'd bleed out. Why were you talking to the Patient?,"I think skinless women are hot. Do a trans-jugular liver biopsy. If she bleeds, at least it stays in her veins. He looks at Wilson",Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
Did you just check with Wilson again?,No. Foreman leaves I felt nothing. It's MS.,Have you heard from Howard?
Apologies aren't supposed to make you feel better. They're supposed to make the other person feel better.,In order to make you feel better.,Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad.
Why is Wilson here?,You were looking for cancer. I thought it would be helpful for he gestures toward Wilson,"Quick question uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?"
We didn't find cancer.,Yes. Which you reported to me five seconds ago. Thought I'd let him finish his hors d'oeuvres before getting the bouncer to take care of him.,"Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
Tried it. Didn't work. Is Cuddy making him oversee?,No!,"Yeah, the Commish."
Then you're making him oversee your choices. You don't trust yourself. Why?,Wilson. Get out.,Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
Are you sure?,Do I need your approval to throw you out? Wilson leaves You happy now?,"Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding."
"It's not MS. SEvere mental illness and Vicodin are all that's left. Mental illness means you can no longer practice medicine. Vicodin means detox, which means pain for the rest of your life. Which means you can no longer practice medicine.",Are you saying we should kill her?,"lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
Are you saying we should kill her? No.,If we stopped her heart we could get our pictures and then restart it.,But I think we should tell her.
What if we can't restart it?,Then she stays dead.,Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
And we only have three minutes until there's brain damage. Sure about this?,Yeah.,Thats seven minutes.
Sure about this? Yeah.,We're gonna stop her heart so I can MRI it. I think it was her idea. Pneumonia was her idea and almost killed my Patient.,Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth.
Her? Ooops.,Kutner was secretly a Woman. That's why he killed himself. Wilson waits It's Amber.,"Oh, some guy she met at the movies."
Your subconscious picked my dead girlfriend?,Yeah. The irrational part of my brain works like the rational part of yours. How about that.,"No, I dont think I picked her up."
It answers questions.,Who cares? I've got competing ideas. They can't both be right.,"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
Everybody gets competing ideas. Everybody has doubts.,"So is it regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?","And yet, I cant help but feel were at odds with one another."
It's on the upper end of you radical. Do you have any alternative?,Nothing that anyone in my head has come up with.,"So, do you have any other possibilities?"
Then you're as safe as you can be.,"Great. starts to leave, turns back You get the LP results back?","Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about."
"Yeah. It's a big shock. You don't have MS. But while I had your blood sample, I checked your Vicodin lEvels. Way too high.",I need the pills.,"No, Im fine."
Not an argument. He knows that's not an argument.,It could still be sParkzophrenia.,Nary an argument?
"House, if you're on anti-psych meds, you're not going to be able to practice.",I know.,"That, Morty, is why you dont go to therapy."
You'd prefer electroshock therapy to rehab?,I'd prefer something that could actually work.,Dyou want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
"I know that you're afraid of the pain, but electoshock?","Don't give me the cancer voice, that overly earnest tone.","Oh, no, no, no, no."
"Heart attack, stroke, seizure, death or worse.",Worse? Double-death?,"What, ways to die?"
Just for a little while. Hopefully.,I have an idea.,"Yes, but for the last time."
Stop having ideas.,Insulin shock.,Dont yell at me.
"Yes. That's marginally less dangerous than ECT. Puts you in a coma, could cause!",Could work.,"No thats, that is incredibly dangerous."
"If you had psychosis, which you don't.","I've had no diarrhea, no sweating, no vomiting. None of the symptoms of Vicodin overdose.",And there was noone there to take care of you?
"Yeah, except the I see dead people thing.",I've been popping pills for years. I've only been seeing things for days. Something changed.,"You know, I believe in ghosts, too."
Vicodin addiction is still more likely.,"So, we're no longer dealing in absolutes.",Its a Nard Dog!
"House, I'll be up in five minutes. Then we can talk about how you'd rather be in a coma than in rehab.","Actually, if you could be up here in two, that'd be really helpful.","Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, Im just chillin at mi casa."
"Actually, if you could be up here in two, that'd be really helpful. Why?",Because I'm about to put myself into insulin shock.,I can get us there in two.
That's a shadow. Two centimeters!,You're only scared because you know this is going to work. He injects the insulin in his left forearm,"Yeahyeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!"
We're over three minutes.,Yes. He begins to seize.,We have a half hour.
You could have died. House pushes the curtain between cubicles aside and looks in.,It worked. Where are my pants?,"I wake up the next morning, all my stuffs gone."
Are you sure? Picks up House's jeans,She's been Everywhere I've been for days.,He does your laundry?
This was not the next rational step.,Now who's being biased? You wanted me to detox as much as I wanted! stops dressing Forgot how to do my zipper.,But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Any other neurological deficit?,"You don't seem to annoy me as usual. I'm not sure that's a deficit. zips pants And, I'm all better.",Hes hanging in there.
Is she really gone?,"Absolutely. I can feel myself repressing all kinds of icky things. I check out, don't I? Wilson shrugs as House's beeper goes off. He checks it Damn.",Im getting dressed.
She'd already been technically dead for three minutes. I thought keeping her alive took precedence over prolonging the photo op.,Any brain damage?,"Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that youre alive."
No. And all tests indiCate that!,Obviously had more time.,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone!"
giving up Best of luck. He leaves,I assume we can't kill her again and take more pictures.,"You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home."
Uhhh. You'll wanna check with Wilson?,Good one.,Let me just check with Bob.
"Could be an abscess infection. Explains why it's invisible in the blood. It's doing its damage behind closed doors, sealed off.","See, the pRoblem with speculation is you make a speck out of you and some guy named Lation which really doesn't affect me at all.","Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didnt realise that had become anything, yet."
We have to guess. It's all we've got. We can't do a biopsy. The last time we went into her heart she had a major cardiac Event.,Which just leaves!,Did they?
What are you looking for?,I don't know yet.,"No, no!"
"The picture doesn't change. She lies there in pain. He sits there, worried.",Nothing changes. pause I just had an epiphany. All by myself. Popped into my head out of nothing.,"The SemiPrivate Labor Room, time lapse, Ross is massaging out a cramp on Rachels hip as Marc opens up the privacy screen."
Care to share?,He's too devoted.,You wanna share it?
Too devoted? You think he feels guilty?,"Right. I'm being cynical. People can care because they care, not because they cheated. Theoretically true. But gonorrhea fits better.",Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years.
No. No STDs. We tested her.,Tested her blood.,"Nono, we talked about it."
That is the test.,"That's not where her pRoblem is. Gonorrhea disseminated to her heart. Got walled off in an abscess, it'd be invisible.",Its been a long time since weve come down here separately.
And it would look like a shadow.,"No need to test her again when we can check Prince Charming. Once you confirm, cut the abscess out of her heart.","And that would be a display of the crisp, gorgeous black."
"Here are your onion rings, extra well done.","Thank you, Molly. And another beer when you get the chance. I'm celebrating.","Come on, I touched one onion ring."
I'm celebrating. Alone?,"Thank goodness. MMMBop is heard. House pulls out his cell phone. Don't tell me, I was right.",Yes! And thats why Im under the table. Celebrating.
at House's desk Yep. Boyfriend has gonorrhea.,And Everyone's a winner.,"Yeah, ininin the bathroom."
"He's not too happy about it. He insists he's nEver cheated, must have gotten it from her.",Don't think so.,How does he feel about it?
Timing would fit. He's got no symptoms and she's dying.,Lying would fit too.,Girl died in her fathers arms.
He's not hanging out in her room anymore. House thinks What does it matter? You were right. We're prepping her for surgery.,"I saw guilt in him. If he's not actually guilty, then I wasn't right. I was lucky.","He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out."
"House, you made a brilliant deduction about her heart.",And if I was just lucky!,"You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler."
"Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think. Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink. The years go by laughs as quickly as a wink. Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself. It's later than you think. Laughs",Wilson. Come get me.,Happy Birdday Um.
I know a nice facility outside Philly. I went to undergrad with one of the directors.,Thanks.,They have fast food in Philly.
I went to undergrad with one of the directors. Thanks.,How Many shirts do I need?,And Im a director.
Like living with Mom again. Delightful.,It's pRobably Foreman.,"Its weird, right?"
He's off the case. He closes the phone.,Patient okay?,This should be fairly easy to deduce.
Yeah. He's lying.,Why don't I feel scared?,"Morty, youre wearing a Vindicator jacket."
I'd say you're unaware of what you're feeling at this moment.,"I feel like crap. My life if falling apart, but I don't feel scared. Not of the rehab, anyway.","Yes, yes I am, one of the many things Im feeling."
We've always been able to find a way to cheat.,It won't work.,Im all for cheating.
"House, it's your only option.",What do I do if my only option won't work?,We should look into that.
You don't give up.,"Hmm. It's either that or electroshock Every six hours. Good night, Wilson.",You cant give up on your dream.
It's late and I'm tired. Can we get to the talking part of this conversation?,I quit.,I suppose we can stay up and talk.
"Great. My nanny is off the clock at 730 so your week off, bigger desk, tighter nurses' uniforms or whatEver other stupid thing you're about to deMand is going to have to wait until!",You can go suckle the little bastard Parkld who makes you feel good about yourself.,"You can have your own office, and a raise!"
Don't do this.,I'm hallucinating.,"Nice scatting, man."
stops From the Vicodin?,Ruled out Everything else.,"Dont be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature."
"We can, uh, admit you through the ER under a pseudonym. No one has to!","I'll cheat, scam, find some way to keep using.",Get out of my ER.
These people know what they're doing.,These people don't know me. You do.,You know what youre doing.
She's not your keeper. She has no responsibility for you.,I need you.,She has nothing to do with this.
Lie down. I'll get you some tea.,Yeah. That'll be better. He watches her leave then leans across the couch to open a decorative box on the end table.,Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
"I already did this room and the bathroom and your bedroom. Where should I look, in the kitchen?",His eyes are watering. He's shivering. His hand has a major tremor. He can barely speak. Coffee cup. On the top shelf.,"Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
Nicely played. She'll think you've come clean and given her Everything. House nods,There's more.,Ill tell her that its over tonight at dinner.
"House, you should tell me where it is now because you won't have the will to tell me in two hours.",My shoes in the closet.,Your room. You may want to repaint.
"Technically, if she dies it's because House has some personal crap to work through and we weren't smart enough to get the answer without him.",False alarm.,"No, Beth doesnt die, she doesnt die."
Drink this. Hands him a glass.,That's your advice? Drink this?,"OK, you know what?"
It's ginger. It'll ease the nausea.,"You know what would calm the nausea? Vicodin. Marijuana. A coma. He sees a lone Vicodin on the floor, past the bath mat.",I think Im gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
"Now, don't pretend you didn't see it. I saw it, which means you saw it. Send her away.",Too bitter. I already have enough bitter.,Honey I swear!
But you can't because that would mean admitting defeat to her. No!,No! No!,What?! You cantwhat did you tell her?
It might be working.,Can you stop? The breathing.,"Well, it better work."
Air goes in. Air goes out.,Then use your nose.,Men just take out wind?
You're supposed to feel like crap. You're doing great.,And after?,"Oh, why do I feel like crap?"
You come back to work.,And what if I can't?,Back to work.
Opioid dependency can make you think you have more pain than you really have. You're going to be okay.,You're telling me what I want to hear. With no evidence.,"All right, I know youre hurting, andand I want to be supportive, but dont say that again."
I'm telling you what I beliEve to be true.,With no evidence.,Why can you not say exactly what I tell you?
You're hardly the most unbiased observer.,Neither are you. Cuddy looks surprised. I'm your hospital's biggest asset.,And thats your unbiased opinion.
Is that why you think I'm here?,That's why you're here. That's why you're lying to me about!,Do you not want me here?
I haven't lied to you in 20 years.,Sure you have.,I just dont want you to lie to me.
You're an ass.,Am I wrong?,Youre a liar.
I wasn't in your endocrinology class.,You sat next to me. I cheated off you in the midterm.,"Oh, I didnt go to college."
I audited your endocrinology class.,Why would you!?,"Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, I loved Dr. Gellers class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
"Because I thought you were an interesting lunatic, Even then. I'm not here protecting hospital property.",We're alone.,Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.
We've been alone all night.,"No, I mean Amber. She's gone.",We are alone.
I'll see you in later? I have some papers to push for you.,Thank you.,"Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?"
"starts to open the door You want to kiss me, don't you?",I always want to kiss you.,Can I kiss you?
Yeah. I think House'll be interested.,"Clang, clang, clang went the trolley.","Jim, youre youre pretty close with him."
Alien hand syndrome.,Set off by a stroke? Or is there a pony in the backyard?,"No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks its holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, its gonna start twisting."
Split brain. Right hemisphere controls the left and,Is making life miserable. Non-logical thinkers often do.,And this is more a yingyang thing.
You're dissing the right hemisphere?,"Most people who have this operation don't Even notice they're missing anything. Left brain has language, arithmetic, rationality. Right brain is a mute loser.","Uh, you weighted 200 pounds."
Right brain is more aesthetically oriented. Has greater facial recognition. I couldn't have been a plastic surgeon without it.,Yes. And where would junior high be without our ability to Judge people on aesthetics?,"Youre right, this side does look better."
"Right brain's also more aware of the present moment, our place in the universe.",It's a universal daisy chain of peace and love that throws buns at people.,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace."
"His present symptoms could mean autoimmune disease, nasolacrimal tumor, an infection or just a cold.","Good morning, sunshine. We got a brand new toy. You wanna play?",Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
We need to talk.,Great.,Its okay.
Great. I love euphemisms. By euphemism I mean when you say something and it means something else. He closes the file and drops it on the table before following Cuddy to his office. Begin eliminating. Search the home.,"The, uh!","Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, Thats not how your dad used to do it."
I'm your boss. You're an employee.,"Well, I'm not normally into role-playing, but if you wanna! He approaches her. She backs up slightly.",You are not my damn boss and you never will be!
"People who get close to you get hurt. That's a fact. You're also a valued doctor in this hospital. That's another fact. From now on, we're gonna focus on the second fact.",So this isn't you freaking out over last night.,But it is a fact that its a privilege to know you.
This isn't an emotional decision. I'm just giving you the rules. You can either accept them or leave.,I slept with Cuddy.,"I think you should leave, young man."
Wow. pause Wow. One for each.,That's what she said. A ha ha ha.,One for me one for Jan.
How's the pain?,She's pRobably got some bruising!,How are you holding up?
"Yeah. I get it. You're a stud. This is serious, House.","I feel better than I did four hours ago. Four hours from now, I'll feel better than this.",I know. Youre the guy who wouldnt chip in for the handyman.
The other wow. You were sober. She was sober?,Clean and sober and hot.,"Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when Im sober."
Wow. This is fantastic. How are you gonna screw it up?,SEveral good options.,Youre not gonna mess it up.
"She left before I woke up, and five minutes ago she told me that I'm just an employee. Ha.",Yes.,Do not listen to her!
"Well, either she's actually in love with you and scared, or she realized last night was a gigantic mistake. You were needy and vulnerable. She was maternal.",You think she jumped me out of pity?,Why would she do this to me?
"No, I'm saying whatEver's going on you! need to talk to her.",Absolutely. He leaves,Sounds like youre holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.
Did you know that male fruit flies have toxic chemicals in their seminal fluid that inhibit the sperm of other males. Chase picks up his tray and leaves.,Wilson says we need to talk.,"No, thank you."
Wilson says we need to talk. We talked.,"I agree. He takes her picture. This has clearly gotten past the talking stage. He leaves, pivoting by the door to take two more pictures.","Yknow, I just was finally happy yknow."
"No, good skin turgor. Not orthostatic.","Could be our tax dollars at work, constantly building new roadways and bridges.","Well, this is a moisturizing mask."
"If you're right, the two halves have begun sending messages again, but it's too early in the process for him to pick up on it. But, we can test for it.",Proof.,He just sent a text.
"You didn't talk to her, did you?","If I talked, she'd have lied.","Oh, then maybe you shouldnt talk to her."
So it's either love or possibly rage.,Don't talk to her.,"Excuse me. Its none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love."
I have no plans to talk to her.,"Manipulation is in your genetic code. You think I'm making a mistake, you move in to correct it.","Shes not gonna see us all day, and she doesnt even care."
You are making a mistake.,She lied to me. Either last night or today. I need to find out which and why.,I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.
"Yeah, that's not freaky at all. No communication.",So far.,"I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets."
A few more minutes.,"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the left hemisphere!",About two more minutes .
That's also the side that was wrong. Right brain's advantage is that it isn't logical. Doesn't choose which details to look at. Makes connections you could nEver see. You owe your insight to the mute loser.,I'll send it tickets to a Phillies game.,Bernadette told me everything.
Confabulation means no communication. Means your theory's wrong.,But he is cold. He leaves the observation area and goes to Scott. Why are you scratParkng?,"I dont know, you see somethin, you hear a word, I thought thats what it was."
Why are you scratParkng? It itches.,Ammonia breath. He opens Scott's gown. Your liver is failing.,"Whos scruffylooking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?"
There's nothing to talk about.,"enters, also drinking coffee I want permission to do a liver biopsy. We're looking for sarcoidosis.","I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
Fine. She puts her coffee cup on the desk,"What do you mean, fine?","Chandlers Office, Shelley is drinking coffee Chandler enters."
"What do you mean, what do I mean? Do you mean that because a liver biopsy is not a test that, by any stretch of the imagination, can be considered risky, so asking my permission is essentially wasting my time, and you're wondering what my reaction to that will be?",Yes. He puts his coffee cup on the desk,"Im not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay."
Are you trying to make me angry?,Yes.,Are you mad?
Do your biopsy. And also do your clinic hours.,I'm blowing off my clinic hours.,Then I see no reason for hostility between us.
"I think you're using your relationship with Cuddy as a replacement for drugs. You should be in more pain so soon into detoxing, but your body's full of roMantic endorphins. And on top of that, you create this distraction of looking for proof.",Think I should stop and let the pain flood back?,Ive devoted my life to him now.
Cuddy is not a Vicodin substitute.,Quite the opposite.,Well this doesnt even smell like opium.
You have to wait for her to be ready.,Great advice. You pretend that I'm gonna do that.,She has to know that your not ready.
You've made two major changes in your life. Not a time anyone's judgment is at its best.,Didn't you use to argue that my judgment would be better off drugs? Admit it. You're curious why I want to make her angry.,"Youre a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them."
"I'm sure it's convoluted, wrong and stupid.",You're dying to know what I found in her coffee cup.,"I dont know, its complicated."
You're dying to know what I found in her coffee cup. No.,"Oxytocin. He goes into his office, followed by Wilson.",Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
Oxytocin. The chemical involved in emotional bonding.,"Her lips say no, her hormones say Oh, my God, yes. More!",The ability to express love physically.
"No. For you to know her lEvels were elevated, you'd need a baseline to compare them with.",I paid the guy in the gym to retriEve one of her water bottles from the trash.,He was already dead.
Love inspires us to greatness.,"So, I need to make her lose her temper. Which breaks her delusion. Which demonstrates to me and to her that there's something underneath this facade.","William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and Im paraphrasing here, Love doth be poison."
And then what happens? She admits Everything and falls into your arms?,That's outcome one. Outcome two is she kills me. I think it's 50/50 right now.,"So she looks at me right, and she goes, Im sorry, dont I even know you?"
I think it's 50/50 right now. Great.,I thought you'd say that.,Id say like.
You're committing yourself to something. To someone. I mean it's Parkldish in a way but ultimately great. Assuming! Are you absolutely sure you want this to succeed?,Why is an old guy standing in my doorway?,You are ready to make a commitment!
"Eugene Schwartz. Eugene Schwartz. Dr. Cuddy asked me to come up here from the clinic. She says you're seeing Patients in your office. It's still free, though, isn't it?",She sent him. That's gotta mean something.,My watch is ended.
"I squawk. Like a parrot. pause Cawwww. No. That's not it. It started a few months ago. I was doing some woodworking in my garage. I was trying to make a chair. Was it the chair? Anyway, all of a sudden, from nowhere, this strange noise comes bursting out of my mouth. Caw, caw. He shakes his head Tough to fake that.","Nice pants. He gets up to leave, Eugene follows him.","Oh, boy! ... Whats that sound?"
Points to a clotting issue. Clots would explain all his symptoms. Why aren't we in the office?,"I'm tired of clinic duty. There's only one thing that could cause squawking, right?","Okay, um... I dont want her watching our baby."
"Yeah. We gave him heparin and did an echo of his heart to see if it was throwing clots, but",More air guitar?,Well take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potatobased religion.
"The heart's fine. We wanted to test for Factor V Leiden, Protein C, Protein S but the hand got tired of cooperating. We finally knocked him out.","And all the tests came up negative anyway, or you would have opened by telling me your brilliant diagnosis.","My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
"He apologized for being sweaty, said it had always been an issue but what if it's a symptom? There are cancers that can cause night sweats and can lead to clots lymphoma!",Or pancreatic cancer. Go scan his pancreas. And try Led Zeppelin.,"Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower."
Got a minute?,There's something wrong with this cup.,"Hey, you got a sec?"
"I need someone to bounce ideas off of. Someone to be my whiteboard. That's how you taught me to work. I have three choices. First, I can accept it's over, pretend we don't work in the same hospital, have selective visual impairment when we pass each other in the hall. Second, I can accept it's over and leave",Or you could try making him angry. Standard choice number three.,I want you to listen to me.
"Third, I can talk to him. But it's not like I have any new fact that I can present and Chase has this roMantic view of love that reality can't compete with.",I know how you could succeed.,Benji isnt in love with me.
I know how you could succeed. How?,"Just say the magic words I will destroy my husband's sperm. She gives him a look. Oh, you mean succeed without doing that. PRobably not.","Great, youre not only more successful than me, now youre more mature."

His room is this way.,"What, do you think I can fix this? We need to offer this guy something he can only get if he stays in the hospital relationship counseling.","No hes, hes alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room."
I don't know if his girlfriend's,I mean his two hemispheres. That's the breakfast of relationships the most important one of the day. He opens the door to Wilson's office. We need your special skills.,Because I dont need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends.

"Hasn't gotten us anything, though. Scan's clean. It's not pancreatic cancer.",Clotting could be a pRoblem well before a solid tumor forms. It can still be pancreatic.,"Right and then everybody finds out and theyre like Oh, I knew all along"
"Yes, but if you want a diagnosis backed by actual evidence, we should pRobably look at other cancers.",House.,"No, Chandlers still in Phase One, and Joeys that thing you smell."
I just squawked.,What?,I was shrieking.
"Eugene Schwartz, your Patient from yesterday. I just squawked. I was buying some flowers for Mona. It happened when I was paying the clerk.",I assume Dr. Cuddy gave you this number.,"This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories."
Yes! She told me to call you any time I squawked.,I'm sorry but I'm about to lose you because I'm about to drive into a tunnel in a canyon on an airplane while hanging up the phone.,"No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me."

I just can't",In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call.
"Right brain, left brain issues?","If the cancer's too small to find, let's make it easier.",Not at all.
Just agitating the pancreas can cause clotting. And you want to do it to a guy whose pRoblem is clotting?,"If I'm right about pancreatic cancer, the only chance he's got is finding and removing those cancer cells now.","Mmm, this wont help him, its a muffin, not cake."
You nEver answered my question.,Relax. Our friendship is not doomed.,You didnt answer question.
Thank God. But my question was do you really want Cuddy or is this just another challenge?,"You're worried that once I'm in a relationship, you and me'll be over.","So, so now do I get Joey?"

If you're standing there when she looks up here,"Oh, no.",If you fall in love with her.
Give him a dopamine drip.,"on the speaker, from the observation deck You weren't looking up at the right time.",Ill tell you what you shouldnt do.
Get to your point. We're a little busy here.,The clots aren't from cancer. They're coming from his heart.,And Im a little busy right now.
We echoed the heart. No clots.,Not while we were looking. Didn't I open with that? The clots were caused by an arrhythmia.,Yes! You! You are soo talented! Its going to be my next special project. Hiring Scrantons most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
The clots were caused by an arrhythmia. No arrhythmia.,Not while we were looking!,"Oh, let me see!"
to Chase We have to get his BP stable.,Absolutely. Right after the echo.,Should we follow him?
Right after the echo. Systolic's 70.,The heart looked healthy at the last echo and an arrhythmia wouldn't cause clots in a healthy ventricle. So start with the left atrial appendage.,I really dont think the colonoscopy was necessary.
So start with the left atrial appendage. Wow.,Yep.,"Yeah, if youre going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area."
Yep. I did it again. Now get this poor guy's BP under control and seal off the appendage. Then all we have to do is find out what damaged his heart before it goes after something he really needs.,So what damages a healthy 20-year-old heart enough to make it send out clots like it's bombing Dresden?,Your grace. This is my laboratory!
Cushing's. Cortisol overproduction could interfere with heart rhythm.,Run a dexamethasone suppression test.,"Were talking about the same Leonard, right?"
We'll just leave the! three of you alone.,Why is there no lipstick on this cup? Cuddy was wearing lipstick when she drank from it. It was on my face. Why isn't it on the cup?,"Okay, assuming we could dance, which we cant, there are three of us and two of them."
Why is it always reasonable in Houseland to take an emotional pRoblem and sidestep it by turning it into a mechanical pRoblem?,"Because in Houseland, and the rest of the universe, by the way, when a question presents itself, it calls for an answer.","Im just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while."
"If the left brain is the interpreter of reality and the one that tells us the story of who we are, then what is your story? Do you wanna be the Man with the answers, or do you wanna be the Man with Cuddy?",What do I do?,Youre a brain scientist.
You make her angry.,You really think that was the best time to mock me?,"Well, what have you done that would upset her?"
"I'm as surprised as you, but I think I'm serious. Communication can't start unless you both",I've been trying to make her angry for,So you two are really serious?
"I do have trouble giving things up. For example, I nEver canceled any of our wedding plans. They both laugh.","Attention! I have an announcement. As you go about your day, I would like you to be aware of the fact that I slept with Cuddy.","Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadettes or my moms."
"This is beyond ass-hood! You have the luxury of not caring about your image. I do not! I can permit a lot of crap, but an employee shouting about his sexual exploits with me no! That is zero tolerance! So congratulations, House. I am angry.",I was wondering if we should move in together.,"Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please."
I wouldn't worry about it. I think she likes you. He's in the doorway to House's office.,"If I'm fired, I think that pRobably means I don't have to see Patients. He starts to walk away.","If you talk to her, youre gonna tell her about Stanley, and thats gonna seem more suspicious."

Well how could you!,"Acid splashes on the vocal chords, they tense, make that squawking sound. It's completely harmless. I'm gonna give you a prescription and you are gonna go away.","So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us."
You are a great doctor.,Why'd you move your belt?,"Im sorry, what did you just say?"
I always move my belt. Makes me sore.,You didn't tell me that.,Why did you need a belt?
"At 86, what isn't sore? Soreness is less important than squawking. It's the squawking that was bothering my wife. House palpates Eugene's abdomen. He grunts.",That's not a potbelly. It's a tumor. That's why pancreatic cancer was on my mind. My brain was trying to tell me!,"So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak."
This isn't sounding good. Pancreatic cancer?,It can cause acid reflux. We should scope you.,"Ok, I have dandruff."
"So it's not good. Even for cancer, it's not good.",No it's not. The elevator doors open and Taub comes out.,Its very good for you.
"The deodorant has a high proportion of propylene glycol. Same stuff made a kid in Singapore dEvelop a heart condition and, get this, seizures. Our Patient may nEver have needed split-brain surgery.",I'm sure he will half-appreciate the irony. Take this Man to radiology. Pancreatic scan. And stay with him. He gets on the elevator.,"Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant."
"WhatEver it is, just say it quickly.",Do you have more than one lipstick in the same shade? Maybe one that has a sealing agent and one that doesn't?,"I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes."
How could that possibly be relevant to anything?,You really don't think you're just! overreacting to the other night?,Do you have any more information that might be relevant?
"Fine. I am overreacting. You've said plenty of lousy things to me before. But reaParkng the final straw has been a good thing because it made me realize we not only don't have a personal relationship, we nEver could.",clearly confused Wha! You! You're! You've been overreacting to something I said?,"Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over toto say that Im sorry. Yknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset."
You insulted me. I walked out. It's nothing that hasn't happened a hundred times before.,I quit.,"Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out."
Great. My nanny is off the clock at 730 so your week off,You can go suckle the little bastard Parkld who makes you feel good about yourself.,"Im taking some time off from workwell, my other workbecause we needed it."
You can go suckle the little bastard Parkld who makes you feel good about yourself. Screw you.,"blinking and trying to clear his head No, no. That that's not what happened. I told you that I needed you. You You helped me.","That is very mature of you, so Im gonna go ahead and say, suckah."
Too bad it isn't true.,shakily as Cuddy touches his cheek No. I'm not okay.,Tell me this isnt true.

"Well, legally, you're free to go whenEver you want, but I suggest you stay.",I'll take it under advisement.,Youre being silly.
"If you thought the hallucinations were from your Vicodin pRoblem, why didn't you just check yourself into a rehab facility?",I was deluded into thinking I might be crazy.,"Uhhuh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it."
"But you had been abusing Vicodin for years. NEver had delusions. NEver had trouble sleeping. NEver had any pRoblems other than narcissism and antisocial behavior, until two colleagues died. Your father died. Your issues run deeper than Vicodin.","Well, that's not gonna cheer me up, is it?","Why, how much is that?"
"You need to be transferred to our long-term ward, started on medication, talk therapy","Yeah, I get it. Uh, just one thing I'm getting hung up on. I can leave whenEver I want.

You want me to mess him up?,Go into Nolan's office. Look at his calendar. I need the name of the Woman he met with at 11 today.,Im finding it really hard not to mess with him.
"No pRoblem. And I'll get you some old-school Parkps. If they have them, I'll get you some dip. But I've nEver seen dip in the vending maParkne.","Yes, get me Parkps and dip. What else?",What are you looking for?
"Let me go! I just wanted a little snack, all right? Yo, I didn't know they maParkne was moved! I want some Ritz Bits. Yo, I might be pregnant! I get these cravings!",You get the name?,"I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. and then I want my nap!"
Nolan's schedule book just has a big X marking out the whole middle of the day.,"Well, then we can assume the girl he's with is called Nooner.",Actually its the movie theatre that has the time schedule.
"chuckling Nooner, Nooner, Nolan's gonna spoon her.",He's gonna fork her.,"Amy, its Pennys turn."
And then he's gonna knife her. House looks at him. I didn't get a chance to check the phone or anything else.,That's okay. I got her license plate. I call my friend. He gets the name. I get the letter that gets me out of here.,"And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal."
You got phone privileges?,I'm on lEvel minus four. I'm still writing with a crayon. You?,"Yeah, well, well see about that."
You got to be at lEvel five. That's like the top of the Space Needle. Hal's the only one that's up that high.,Hal's at lEvel five?,"Open the pod bay doors, HAL."
They give him a point Every time he clears his plate. I've been eating his potatoes.,Will he sell you some minutes?,points to Chandler This guy?
No. I pay two cigarettes for the potatoes. Phone's worth a lot more.,thinks Can you cheek a pill?,"Come on man, youre not a potato."
thinks Can you cheek a pill? No.,That's too bad for you.,"Yeah, see, I cant pull of babydoll can I?"
That's too bad for you.,You sure you're good with this?,Lucky for you.
"Yeah, yeah. Gotta be done.",So how do we start?,"It had to be done, it had to be done."
"Dude, that was awesome.",Think Hal will mind if they're wet?,"Dude, thats incredible!"
Think Hal will mind if they're wet? House?,No. It's your other friend at the asylum.,"Well, Im gonna go get these in some water."
How's it going?,"Hallucinations are gone, so is the Vicodin.",Hello. Scott. Table for four.
closing his laptop and putting it on the table How's the leg? How's the pain?,They got me on some non-narcotic. I'm dealing. I need you to run a license plate.,"Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk."
"Was there a hit-and-run on your floor? House, just do what you're supposed to do. Listen to the doctors and I'll be able to visit soon.","Track down the owner of this car, and I'll be able to visit you in your office tomorrow.","Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette."
House. House. He called me.,What did he want to know?,"What, he gave you his home number?"
"He wanted to know about you. He wanted to warn me that you'd be calling for something. And he told me if I wanted to help you get better, I had to let him do his job.","Well, now I'm calling you to tell you that if he calls you",Hes calling to ask you a favour.
"House, I'm so sorry. I wish I could help you.",You can.,"Stuart, wed love to help you out, but this a bad time, were about to have a baby."
I wish I could help you. You can.,It turns out! you're my only friend.,"No, cant help you now."
"House ain't a newbie, now he living on this floor. He's holding a slipper like a microphone. He holds it out toward House.",And I hate you. I'm gonna cooperate.,Now he is saying Hi louder.
That's not much of a plan. That's actually their plan.,"No, I'm pretty sure their plan is for me to actually swallow the pills, to actually cooperate.","Yeah, thats the only thing wrong with that plan."
I'm so proud of my little roomie. All the guys except Freedom Master are at a table playing cards. Alvie reaches across to pinch House's cheek. I only taught him Everything he knows. House brushes his hand away as Stomp giggles slightly.,"One, two, three.",He plays with people.
"He has a red face card Uh, two cigarettes.","He's not confident, Alvie. Crush him, in the form of a rhyme if you want.",One of the tickets is for him.
"with the 8 of spades No regrets, raise ten cigarettes.",Oh. That's a lot of nerve for someone with a two on their head.,"Oh wait, I have the ten of spades!"
approaParkng Can I play?,reaParkng for her Come here.,Ok I can run it?
reaParkng for her Come here. Why?,I want to see if you've got what it takes.,I thought you broke up with her.
How are you feeling today?,"Better than yesterday, not as good as tomorrow.",Hows everybody doing today?
"Better than yesterday, not as good as tomorrow. He takes the pills and water. As he passes Alvie, he sticks out his tongue. There are two pills on it. Alvie smiles and touches his nose.",I've been humming to her. She sways. It might be significant. Lydia continues playing. Are you ignoring me or are you just letting my charm wash over you.,"Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesnt change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?"
smiling as House sits next to Annie Kind of tough to play and chat. A couple of weeks ago you told me playing to her was a complete waste of time.,You're right. Your playing does get worse when you talk. She gives him a very funny look. I assume she loved music.,"Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room."
She played for the Philadelphia Philharmonic cello.,"Well, if she responded to the piano, she might respond Even better to the cello.",I never wanted to play the cello.
stopping playing I play a little. Hmm. Maybe I'll bring one in on Tuesday. Thank you. He nods acknowledgement.,Different desk. Different doctor.,"Okay. Leonard, even though I dont have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it."
"You've been on meds for a while now. I'll be checking in with you periodically to see if we need to adjust your dose. Any dry mouth, trouble sleeping?","Nope. Can I go now? There's a Manic out there with a fresh carton of cigarettes, and he's a terrible bluffer.",Those miserable old shits didnt want you to be human.
chuckling It's nice to see that you and Alvie are friends again. Tell me about your fight.,He hit me. I hit him back. Repeat until pulpy.,Glad I was sitting down for that.
Alvie told me you instigated the thing.,"Well, that tends to be the way fights work different interpretations of the same circumstances.",I had a little to do with it.
Very understanding attitude.,There's that tone again.,Youre very respectful.
There's that tone again. You're smart.,"How come Every time you compliment me, it sounds like an accusation?","Hey, dont you take that sarcastic tone with him."
"You're not having any side effects from your meds, which is unusual.",It's not that unusual.,Youre doing fine.
The story about the fight isn't adding up.,"Why don't you stop pretending that you haven't reached a conclusion? You don't trust me. Actually, it's more fundamental than that. You don't like me.","Oh, good, because as of four oclock this afternoon, I am not."
I didn't say that.,You think I'm not taking my meds.,You didnt actually say that.
You think I'm not taking my meds. Are you?,Yes. So what do you want me to do? Want me to take a urine test? Will that earn your trust?,Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
Have at it.,"A little dignity, please.",You know what?
You know the rules. I have to watch.,"Yeah, but you don't have to have courtside seats. Can I at least use a stall?","Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe Ill... Ill finish explaining the rules. Lets... let me explain it first, and then..."
"Yeah, but you don't have to have courtside seats. Can I at least use a stall?","For he himself has said it, and it's greatly to his credit, that he is an EnglishMan. He i-i-i-i-is an EnglishMan.","Oh, well, then youll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff."
"For he himself has said it, and it's greatly to his credit, that he is an EnglishMan. He i-i-i-i-is an EnglishMan.",Get it while it's hot.,"Obviously, and hes British."
Just one quick lift.,Why are you doing that?,"Oh, I took out my lifts."
"quietly House, it's none of your business.","putting down his cards and turning I'm just curious. As a doctor, What are you doing?","Well, yknow III think Im gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend."
"Either he is Freedom Master, and he shouldn't be here, or else he's suffering from a serious and dangerous delusion that he needs to deal with.",taking his cane and standing So! legit medical reasons. You're not just trying to break the guy because he's a little different.,Hes been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding.
Don't do it.,I'm not doing anything.,Its gonna be ok.
"You're thinking. Thins go from thinking to doing way too fast in this place. You keep thinking, you're gonna wind up with no mo in your mojo.",I'm thinking of hitting you again.,Thats because you overthink everything.
You hate Medina. You hate all of them. You want to hurt them. You got to keep pretending. Step away from the hate.,What's the difference between pretending to cooperate and cooperating?,"Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you."
Pretending is pretending. It's not real. You don't mean it.,I sat and watched while he did something stupid and pointless. I cooperated.,"Well, we dont really have to pretend."
"Yeah, isn't it pretty?",Where's Freedom Master?,"Yeah, its beautiful."
He isn't able to take part.,Get out there. They said Everybody has to get out there. Talk! Say something!,"Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his."
"Dr. House, leave him alone.",Did you drug him?,"Wait a minute, his name is Dr."
Of course I didn't drug him.,He has a flat affect. He's practically catatonic.,I didnt conspire with him.
"Double chocolate. Yummy, yummy.",Don't tell me that he's fine! You did this. He was functioning. He was happy.,"Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if theres writing on it, make sure its not all caps."
He was delusional.,Yeah. He's way better off now.,"Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?"
Let's talk. Thinking sucks.,"I'm not allowed to get angry? They screwed him up. And for the record, I am two privilege lEvels above Susan. And I got the same depression-scale score.","Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar?"
Every Patient is different. It's not about scores and lEvels and,Happiness is happiness. The test is the test. Coping is coping.,"No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!"
And you think you're,Absolutely!,And you are
"If you want to counter, I'll likely fold. No.",No is not an argument. Are you trying to frustrate me?,"Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face."
Are you trying to frustrate me? No.,No again?,Sorry. Did I startle you?
So your proof of your well-being is that you lied?,"Manipulated. My proof is that I can fool the test, I can fool you, which means I am high functioning. I am sane, rational, capable. I should not be here.",Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
These are your pills from today? Nolan picks one up from where House dropped them on his desk.,I'm not gonna take it. I'll just cheek it again.,"No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan."
I'll just cheek it again. Lick it.,You want me to lick your hand?,Youll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncles blood.
You want me to lick your hand? I washed.,It's sugar.,"You want me to wash my hands first, dont you?"
So! what's the next plan?,There is no new plan. I'm out of plans.,"So, uh, whats your plan moving forward?"
So what do we do?,"We stop talking. He lifts his leg and lies down, facing he wall.",They dont have this kind of technology at the vets.
"We stop talking. He lifts his leg and lies down, facing he wall.","I see you've got some cello in your trunk. She turns to face him. And, no, that's not a euphemism. He stands.","Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down."
Are you spying on me?,I'm living in a psyParkatric hospital. Staring out of the window is what we do. I assume you'll need help carrying it up. I still got grounds privileges.,"Okay, just to be clear, youre terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage."
And who's going to carry you when you're carrying the cello?,"Yes, cast aside the useless cripple. How very GerMan of you.","All right umm, a string quartet for the procession."
"Seriously, the thing weighs a ton with that case. I think I need a dolly.",Or we could ask Clark Kent to pitch in.,I had no idea it was so heavy.
The dolly's pRobably easier.,"Eh, the dolly!","I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest."
"Eh, the dolly! already feels good about itself. He was a happy-go-lucky superhero until they told him he has no powers. We let him help out, he feels good about himself. Might be less depressed.",So why do you put your life on hold to visit your sister-in-law five times a week?,Do you remember how your father used to be?
Am I somehow a bad person for showing compassion?,No.,Am I a terrible person?
You gonna dangle them in front of him to entertain him?,I'm gonna make him feel like he's flying.,"No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! Were not at a barn dance. Youve gottayou wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?"
"I'm gonna make him feel like he's flying. I'll just drive him around the grounds, top down, wind in his hair. She laughs. Seriously! you're gonna say no to that? pointing at Freedom Master",Why are you so nice to me?,Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
I think you have a good heart.,Would you still be nice to me if I told you that I lied?,I think youre a really sweet guy.
Would you still be nice to me if I told you that I lied? I'm not just driving around the grounds in your convertible. I'm kidnapping him and stealing your car.,You sure?,"By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies youve been telling lately."
Bonnie and Clyde get shot to pieces. She closes the door.,Hmm. See you.,And what happens in this one?
Hmm. See you.,You can do this.,"Okay, see you."
Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo!,Don't let go!,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Freedom Master's back! He runs past House. A family getting into their car looks nervous.,"Keep it down, Freedom Master.","No, Michael. Im not leaving the car."
off screen Whoo!,You're scaring the good citizens.,Off the backboard!
running up to House That was the coolest moment of my life.,It was fun. Freedom Master runs in a circle House. You can repay me by telling Nolan he's an idiot.,"I was across the street at the doityourself car wash, taking a shower."
Smell that fresh air and the warmth of your yellow sun.,We do enjoy it.,I need some fresh air.
"Thank you, Greg.",yells NO! as Freedom Master flies off the side of the garage.,What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview?
"He's lucky to be alive. He's got a lacerated spleen, rotational pelvic fracture, compound break of the femur and humerus. Everything in your life has been about finding the truth. But suddenly, with this guy, you decide to reinforce a sick Man's delusions. You just wanted to take a swing at me, hmm? You don't care about getting out. You don't care about him. You don't Even care about the truth. You don't care about anything, House. I'm transferring you to Winslow PsyParkatric. You'll have better luck pulling the wool over their eyes. starts to walk away I'm done.","has been staring at him, looking terrified about what he did Don't. Nolan stops and looks back. I need help.",Wow. I cant believe it! Look at you! Are you nauseous?
"has been staring at him, looking terrified about what he did Don't. Nolan stops and looks back. I need help.",So how's this supposed to work?,"Oh, jujujust stay calm."
You sit. I sit. We talk.,About what?,We sit close.
About whatEver you want.,You want me to whine about my mother?,"So, what should we talk about?"
Do you want to whine about your mother?,I can tell you about the time I was five and my goldfish died.,"So, I hear you saying youre angry with your mother."
If that's where you'd like to start.,I've had a billion things happen to me in my life. How am I supposed to know which ones are relevant?,I think youll find what youre looking for over there.
"As far as I'm concerned, they're all relevant.","Well, we better get moving, 'cause this session could take 50 years.",Important enough for the likes of you.
"Yes, you are the sum of Everything that's happened to you. And, yes, some Events are more relevant than others. But, uh, the only way we can figure out which ones are is to talk. So tell me, what's on your mind? pause What do you want?",I want to get better! WhatEver the hell that means. I'm sick of being miserable.,I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
So you'd like to be happy?,"Again with the reflecting Yes, I'd like to be happy.","I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it."
Being happy is an excellent goal. Not Many Patients can crystallize exactly what they're hoping to get out of this.,"Well, bully for me.","If youd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, youd be happy all the time."
rising So now all we have to do is figure out how to get you from here to happy. He goes to a siDeboard and takes something out of a drawer.,SSRIs? That's your genius technique?,"Oh, just, you know, moving something upstairs."
I don't think we should ignore any tools than can help. hands them to House I know you don't have a pRoblem taking drugs.,For my leg. For pain.,Put those away before you hurt yourself.
"Well, think of this as being for psyParkc pain.",I don't want to change who I am.,No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
"Miserable? He hands House the glass. House contemplates the pill. Do you think that by taking meds you'll lose your edge, stop making the unique connections that make you a successful doctor?","If Van Gogh was your Patient, he'd be satisfied painting Houses instead of The Starry Night.",Because I dont feel good flirting with doctors for sales.
"Van Gogh would still be making inspired paintings of the night sky, just maybe not from the room of his asylum.",You don't know that.,"And then every morning, Id walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city."
"I know both his ears would be intact. And I know his life would be better. House puts down the glass and stares at Nolan. I know this doesn't come naturally to you. But you want my help, which means you need to trust me.",Hmmm! Delicious.,"You know, Amy, I, uh, cant help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place."
Why are you here?,"I'm waiting for my communion wafer. He takes the pills and the water, handing the empties back to Safer. Alvie follows him as he walks away from the office.",Weve got to leave.
"You're cheeking it, right?",Nope.,Just one cheek.
grabbing House's face and trying to look in his mouth Tell me you're cheeking it.,pushing Alvie's hands away I swallowed it. He starts to walk away. Alvie follows.,"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip."
"No, you didn't. We don't take meds.","You don't take meds, Alvie. I decided to get sane.","Okay, Im just teasing you."
You're scamming again. You can tell me.,"I'm not scamming, Alvie.","Wait a second, I see what youre trying to do here!"
They broke you.,turning to look at him They didn't break me. I am broken. Now stop worshipping me and go worry about your own loser life.,"Yes, thats the problem."
I hate you.,Prom?,Now you hate me too.
Got an assignment for you.,"taking off his glasses Role-playing? I'm not sure how pretending to be a businessMan with a foot fetish is gonna help, but I'm game.",Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
Have you connected with any of the other Patients? You've been here four weeks. Tell me about your relationships with the other Patients.,Diane! is convinced that Silent Girl hates her. Richter's not as paranoid as you think. He just likes that you think that. And my roommate hates me.,"Great! Its so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you Im all like, Can the doctor see me now?"
Only one of the things you said indiCated how somebody else feels about you. So!,"I'm sure that they've done some form of rudimentary analysis on me, concluded that I'm a jerk.","So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
"You know, there is a way for them to find out things about you without deductive reasoning.",I have had relationships.,"Theyre gonna find out about me eventually, right?"
You've screwed up relationships. Every one of them. Almost like that was the goal. I want you to trust! people. House stares at him. Try. He puts the suit on the bed. Get dressed. He leaves.,Just open up?,Your little man is unraveling.
Just open up. Trust.,Strangers?,"Babe, open up."
"We'll start with strangers then work our way up. If it helps, I find hello to be an excellent icebreaker.",Hi.,I start with some chitchat and a maybe a couple of jokes.
Hi. uncomfortable Hi.,It's like hello only shorter.,Hi. Ow. Hi.
Yes. I'm glad we were able to save that time.,"Judging by the fancy suit, I'd say you were a donor.","Sure, I so glad we did this."
It can be tough sometimes.,I'm not gay.,"Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard."
"Oh, neither am I.","Actually, I am.","Yeah, me neither."
You're not gay.,"No, but I have to tell intimate secrets to people.","Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are."
Maybe they should be true.,"Hadn't thought of that. To be on the safe side, I should pRobably do both, starting with the fun ones. Come on, let's get me better.",Come on. starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
"Hadn't thought of that. To be on the safe side, I should pRobably do both, starting with the fun ones. Come on, let's get me better.",Hi.,"Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you."
Hi. Hi.,geekily plays with a straw I'm a philanderer.,Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
geekily plays with a straw I'm a philanderer. Oh.,Philanderer doesn't mean that I give a lot to charity. It means,Areare you saying hes a geek?
I-I know what it means.,"Uh, you were asking me if there were any nuts in the hors d'oeuvres.",Okay. How bout a little Miley Cyrus next?
"Uh, you were asking me if there were any nuts in the hors d'oeuvres. What?",looking up Honey! He stands.,"I dont know what that is, Pam."
to House We're going. Having fun?,I did connect with one guy. But my propensity for screwing things up overtook me. Then my desire to have fun overcame my propensity.,"Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, Ive got some friends coming over."
"Good night, Doctor. Nolan leaves. She hands a glass to House and sits down. Are you in trouble?",thinks about that Apparently not.,Well! Good night. Im going upstairs.
So what's next? You want to be my pimp?,Why don't we just talk?,So Im a pimp huh?
Why don't we just talk? Okay.,How come you weren't pissed at me for stealing your car?,"Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first."
It was a nice thing to do.,Hmmm. I'm not sure about the GerMan-English translation of nice. Stealing was nice or! ruining Freedom Master's life?,"It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish."
"What you did was misguided and irresponsible, but it was also nice. You gave him a moment of pure happiness. pause You asked me why I come here so often to visit Annie. She was my best friend. Then she started pulling away! from Everybody. The doctors don't know why. I think I married her brother because he was the only other one who was going through the same thing. But he stopped visiting after a couple of years. I just! couldn't stop. I miss her. House nods. There's a long pause. I should go.",Good night.,I was sorry when he died.
So what happened?,You're talking to me now.,What happened now?
Was it fun?,sounding a little surprised Yeah.,Did you have fun doing it?
sounding a little surprised Yeah.,She kissed me. Don't read into the phrasing. We kissed each other.,"Sursurprise him? Were not, were not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
And how do you feel about that?,How do I feel about that? It was a kiss. Kisses are good things.,And how did that make you feel?
Kisses are good things. Okay.,That was a loaded okay.,"Nonono, the kiss was good."
Not at all. Why would you assume that?,"'Cause you're being judgmental. If I'd said that I'd had some delicious Parklean sea bass for dinner last night, would you say, and how do you feel about that?","Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a fiveyear mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal fiveweek mission to do the same."
"If the sea bass was married, I might.","laughing slightly See, you're being judgmental. Isn't that against your code or something?",Sea bass. Ill have the sea bass.
I'm simply stating the obvious. It's compliCated. Not just because she's married and not just because you're institutionalized. I know you spent the last 12 hours trying to figure out what that kiss means.,sitting up then slouParkng back in the chair Who's that Woman you were with in the Parking lot?,Youre right. Youre absolutely right. Im gonna go in there and tell her that we cant be together.
"When you deflect, it's more effective when you're not that transparent.",Obviously you have no pRoblem with the infidelity.,"No, there is a defense for that."
"You're trying to rationalize that, if it's okay for your doctor, it's okay. But, just for the record, I am not having an affair.",Then who is she?,Come on!
Why do you think you're working so hard to figure out the details of my personal life?,I might not have to work so hard if there were some personal items in here.,"Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all."
Why are you so afraid to talk about this?,I want to talk about you. I want to know who I'm taking advice from.,Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?
I'm not giving you advice. I'm asking you questions. I think that kiss meant a lot. I think that scares you.,I think there are no personal items in here because you have no personal life.,"Oh God, I cant believe youre making such a big deal about this."
How do you think you and Lydia will end?,you are a lonely Man. You've screwed up Every opportunity you've had in life.,She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
What's the ending to the story?,sighs I don't know.,"When we tell this story, lets end it differently."
sighs I don't know. Visiting time!,Why did you kiss me?,"I dont know, Shelly."
How'd it go with Lydia?,I found out you can only be happy so long before the catatonic guy with two broken limbs rolls off the elevator. Philosophically speaking.,Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
Why do you value your failures more than your successes?,My mother caught me masturbating! to pictures of her mother.,"Penny, you face failure on a daily basis."
Can we get past these cut deflections?,Successes only last until someone screws them up. Failures are forEver.,"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?"
So you accept that fact. You accept that there's nothing you can do.,"Okay, I accept the fact that there's nothing I can do. Now, what can I do?","Hey, Ive come to terms with it, you have to too."
"You acknowledge failure, and you move past it. You apologize.","Wow. Powerful things, these apologies. Get someone to jump off a building and you say two words and you move on with your life. Hardly seems fair.","Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know?"
"Is that the issue? You caused him pain. If the world is just, you have to suffer equally? House lets this sink in as Nolan laughs slightly. You're not God, House. You're just another screwed-up huMan being who needs to move on. Apologize to him. Let yourself feel better. Then you can learn to let yourself! keep feeling better.",Hey.,"I wronged Howard, and he wont accept my apology."
"Dr. House, Everything okay?",Yeah.,"Howard, is everything okay?"
"Sure you do. You all do. Steve, don't you think that Diane has hidden talent that we'd all like to see come out? Steve doesn't move.",You really think he's gonna answer?,"Yes I do, its just that Ross is."
You really think he's gonna answer? Eventually.,Why?,"No, I called him."
Because things pass.,"Things change. It doesn't mean they get better. You gotta make things better, you can't just keep talking and hope for the best. House starts looking in the distance, puzzled.",Its not our fault.
"Diane, maybe you and I can work together and figure something out.",getting up I can save him.,"Here, let me."
"Dr. House, please.","pointing, rattling the glass 'Cause there's a music box in there.","Well, Monica and Chandler cant go."

It's just a wild coincidence that he thought you were a rude jerk.,Come on. Give me the benefit of the doubt. You said he's a jerk. I barely talked.,You were just being so nice to him!

You did break in.,Online. There's no reference to him in any of the vet records.,"Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering."
Why would he fake being a veteran?,Just look how you're acting. People have been tiptoeing around this jerk for years.,Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?
"Normally, we'd all tell the amputee to go screw himself.","Victims get pity, heroes get adulation. It's way better.","A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy cant walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
Thank you for trying to help me out with my neighbor. Now forget the Vietnam stuff.,I could prove this.,This was my home for many years.
But you won't because you'll be too busy writing him a letter of apology and dropping it at his door without knocking at his door.,"I didn't do anything, the guy's a totally ass.","Yknow what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If hes not gonna let me do it on the phone, Im gonna go down there and do it in person."

"Am I trying to kill our Patient? Of course not. But if he died, am I supposed to just pretend that wouldn't be good for the world? The cells are neatly differentiated. This isn't lymphoma.",Thought I had detected the sickly sweet smell of maple syrup and socialized medicine.,l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.
You broke into my apartment?,"Technically, no. Well, technically, yeah, but two steps. Hardly",You came to my apartment.
You're going to jail.,"Speaking of, you know what can get you six months and a $100,000 fine? Falsely claiming that you won a medal in Vietnam.","Well, youre going to have to run, or youre going to be in a lot of trouble."
You think I'm faking?,"Canada did not send troops to fight in Vietnam, you idiot.","Yeah, and maybe that youre a real"
"They sent troops to reinforce the '73 Peace Accords, Which is where I tried to free a 12-year-old boy who stepped on a land mine. 36 years later, Every second, I feel the pain in my hand like I'm still grabbing that boy's arm, Even though my arm isn't there. So, no, I'm not faking.","Oh. On a related note, go Maple Leafs.",Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
He just started spiking a fEver.,It's scleroderma.,"Sheldon, youre being ridiculous."
You don't have some clEver way of telling me this time?,Patient's dying. I'm done with clEver. Look at his skin. He holds up a small photo from the file. It's tight for a 75-year-old.,"So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? Im trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today."
Based on his admission photo? Bit subjective. FEver points to infection. And now he's got nodules on his fingers. That's blastomycosis.,Nodules? And you're calling tight skin subjective?,Are you going below?
I'm with Foreman. We would have seen fungus balls on the head CT.,Fungal lesions can be missed.,I didnt make it back.
"Point to, not prove. And his fEver's too high. We have to treat him now.","We treat wrong, we could send this disease into overdrive. You're with me on the scleroderma.","Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop OHara?"
I guess. I just don't care enough about the Patient to waste my time trying to convince anyone,We get it.,You dont need to persuade me.

"I switched his meds. I thought I was wrong, so I took him off the antifungals. Put him on steroids like you said.",You know what that means.,Did he give you that whole Yourenotuptothis thing again?
I was too late. Or I was right in the first place.,"So either you killed him by not having confidence in your opinion, or you killed him by being too attached to your opinion.",Thank you so much for this.
He's under lock and key in the morgue. His government wants their own doctors to do the autopsy. They're taking his body out tomorrow.,There's a reason I hired you. You used to know what to do with a locked door.,"Yeah, we met in college."
My neighbor called. He sounded! happy.,That's nice.,What are you so happy about?
"Even nicer, he's approving the garden expansion.",joining Wilson on the couch Huh.,"Actually, he is buying a much bigger place."
And Even more nicer! He's not going to press charges. Even if you don't move out. What did you do to him?,I was nice. pause You really want to know?, Did I arrest him?
"My son... has already been in good hands, and he's still dying. I'm through dealing with good. I want the best, and Everyone I've asked says that's House. So unless he's dead, comatose, or insane, I want him treating my son, today.","You could have said no, in good conscience.",I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness.
Then he's not my Patient. You want to give me none of the responsibility and all of the liability?,"Which means I get... Looks excited. Oh, cool.",Hes not my client.
When is he getting his license back so we can stop playing this game?,Looking at the file. Maybe nEver. This game is fun.,And in the meantime you better let him drive.

Not you. Foreman's department.,"Oh, right. Well, he's got all the time in the world.","Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.

"Mom died from kidney failure caused by type one diabetes, which has been ruled out.","17 doctors. Everything's been ruled out. Which means we have to re-rule out. Get a new history and physical. Looks at Foreman. Unless that's crazy, boss.",Does she smell?
I want to know you have Everything covered.,Suddenly appears in the doorway. Got what covered?,I have it covered.
We're just reviewing the Dibala case. Making sure we didn't miss anything.,We didn't. Except of course the thing that killed him. House stares at Chase.,"UUUm, I think theres been an oversight."
Obstruction would explain the pain. You think they just screwed up the old X-ray? Looks at House.,"Nope. Smiles at Foreman, who looks back at the X-ray.",Youre not going to die.
"Actually, you're not going to taste it. Jack looks at the bag of liquid that Cameron is now holding. He then realizes what's going to happen .",To the person behind him. You should try searParkng for Misty May digs for gold. Thirteen's turns around surprised. Make sure you put it in quotes.,"Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures."
I'm making travel plans. Just need to get away. Have some time to myself. Looks back at her laptop. You getting the hint?,So that's it? Turns his chair around so he can see her. You're done with your little experiment with Foreman?,Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
"It wasn't an experiment. It was a relationship. You may want to look into the difference. They look at each other, Thirteen smiles. I'm glad you're better, House. I actually liked working for you. But I'm not coming back.","Good. 'Cause if you came back, Foreman would try and save the relationship and he'd give up being the boss.","Well, youve lived with your significant other for some time."
Are you here to try to save my relationship with Foreman?,God no.,Heres whats going to happen.
I'm going to Thailand.,Really? Interesting.,Im going to China.
"Smiles. Good-bye, House.",Good-bye Thirteen. Leaves.,"Im going home to live my creepy, pathetic life."
"He hasn't had any more seizures, and cytological examination of the subdural fluid showed no abnormalities.",Don't usually see brain damage after a rectal biopsy.,Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
Got to be some sort of systemic infection.,Not after spending the last week getting pumped full of IV antibiotics.,"But you cant get your hands on this one, can you?"
Notice anything odd about the shape of the fluid collection?,"Oh, God, it's... The Virgin Mary. Cameron rolls her eyes.",Does it look like a urinal?
"The edge should be tapered, lens shaped.",Stares at the X-ray.,What are you doing?
Stay out of my life.,Okay. Goes to shut the door but Thirteen stops him.,Keep me out of it.
I know you canceled my reservation. You obviously saw me log in when you were spying on me in the coffee shop.,I was talking to you. I was spying on the milf in the running shorts.,"Im sorry, sir, but Im not seeing you in here."
I'm not coming back on the team.,I don't want you back on the team.,I dont plan on coming back.
"I cannot work for, with, or around Foreman.",Which is why I don't want you back on the team.,Because youre impossible to work with.
"Now that you're out of the picture, he's better than Ever, which is going to make me less miserable than Ever, which is why neither of us gives a damn how, when, or on what island in the Bahamas you went to get from it all. The Bahamas?",Costa Rica?,"Look, I know you dont want to hear this right now but, weve seen him in his new place, alright."
I told you Thailand.,"I assumed you were lying, because it would have been idiotic of you to tell me truth. Yet another reason I have no use for you. House shuts the door.",Youre a mean old woman.
How can so much be wrong with nothing being wrong?,Since when has cancer been considered nothing?,"Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people."
And so are the most recent CT scans.,"On the other hand, adenocarcinoma of the stomach would cause pain, constipation, nutritional deficiencies that could cause seizures.",The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are are staggering.
And wouldn't show on a CT.,"You were right about the cancer, just wrong about the place.","All right then, your bra would still be big."
Go scope him. Get another set of biopsies. Cameron and Chase leave.,"I'd get canceling her ticket, if you then showed up with two more to somewhere better.",Why cant you just agree with me sometimes?
What are you talking about?,Or showed up at all. But how does just ruining her plans get her to agree to yours?,I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked!
You talking about Thirteen? Where's she going?,"Well, nowhere this week, thanks to you.","Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woohoo."
I didn't stop her. I'm not going to stop her. I've already done all I could. Now all I can do is move on.,I think...,"You know, I had a chance to stop her too!"

You think we're setting this off?,I think something is.,Oh. Is this freaking you out?
But with no abnormality in the other layers and no evidence of a cellular inflammatory reaction.,It's definitely not cancer.,No that was Jarred!
Unless it's a drug-resistant strain.,"Turns around to face them. Drug-resistant strain of what? Bacterial cultures, viral serologies, ANA and a NCA were all negative.",Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?

Not Even close. Everything okay?,Just waiting for whatEver is about to go wrong.,uhm... Is everything okay?
Just waiting for whatEver is about to go wrong. Thirteen called.,She have a theory that makes more sense than abdominal epilepsy?,Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
She said someone hacked into her email account and canceled an airline reservation. I'm guessing Foreman.,"Really? You're accusing Foreman, not me? Cool.",Pam... I hope she didnt do anything to the food.
You really want Foreman to stay in charge of the team?,"Makes sense. He loves power, and I love puzzles.",You really want Packer as your boss?
You love power and puzzles.,True. But when I had them both... It wasn't Foreman.,I know youve been giving me secret puzzle tests.
How do you know?,He said he's moved on.,Central Perk.
And you beliEve him?,I beliEve that he beliEves it.,Do you trust him?
Are you Dr. House?,I understand you're a big fan. I'll have my guy send over a signed glossy.,Might wanna run that by Angela cause its so cute.
Continuous EEG shows no interictal spikes. It's not abdominal epilepsy.,You paged me to tell me what it's not?,"No, she always looks like that."
I paged you to show you this. Opens Jack's gown to show sEveral large red spots on his chest.,That... I did not expect.,"Im sorry, I thought youd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room."
Well what the hell is that supposed to mean?,Darn it. I knew I should have stayed outside. Fantasy's always much better than the reality.,"You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises."
"You think this is a joke? That's my son, he's dying, and not one of you seem to have the slightest clue why.",I know. That's why it's so interesting.,Posting that I died?
I know. That's why it's so interesting.,"FEver, stomach pain, seizures, peritoneal and subdural fluid collection and now spots.","I know, I just thought it would be fun."
Could be an allergic reaction to one of his meds.,That suddenly dEveloped eight hours after he started the meds?,"Putting on the sneakers thought Id get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything"
"If it's not cancer or infection, it has to be autoimmune. Systemic lupus compliCated by a CNS vasculitis would explain the rash, fEver, ascites...",CNS vasculitis would cause a stiff neck along with a headache.,"Stop! Dont look at me. On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly. Pretend to make yourself a sandwich."
"Okay, you come up with something better. Everyone looks up at House.",Go on.,"Dont look up, theres cameras."
"Well, barely is more than not barely. They look at House again.","Not my decision. But if it was, I'd say start him on prednisone and get a testicular biopsy. If he's going to have any real inflammation, it'll be down there.",Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
Then say so. Don't be a Parkld. Gets up to go.,Is it on his penis? Cameron stops and looks at him. Kid's rash?,"Yknow what, it doesnt matter what you say its not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go."
"Kid's rash? Yeah, why?",Means it's most likely affecting the small blood vessels.,"Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldnt pick up a disease from the other children."
Means it's most likely affecting the small blood vessels. That's why we didn't see any inflammation on the biopsies. It's not polyarteritis. It's Degos disease. The all just stand there. I'll do it.,Your son has Degos disease.,You should know those men killed themselves.
What's the treatment?,There isn't one. It's incurable.,Lets show em.
You're wrong. You've already been wrong a bunch of times.,We've rechecked the biopsies. It's definitely Degos. I'm sorry. I wish there was something we could do.,"Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrows the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didnt get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldnt be here tonight because... its not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didnt have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldnt be here..."
I wish there was something we could do. How long?,Not much longer.,How long should we stay?
What does that mean?,A day at the most. Roy starts crying. House nods and leaves the room.,"Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark."
"Roy, he's right. You're borrowing money to buy options that are already out of the money. Even you won't be able to cover the losses. Your House, cars, bank accounts. You'll lose Everything.",That's the point. The billionaire thinks that the gods will treat him better if he's broke. I suggested he give it to me...,"Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky."
There's got to be some sort of balance. You can't have all the good fortune in just one area of your life. It's not how the world's supposed to work.,Who said the world is supposed to work?,Isnt it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?
I can't get anything back. He's insane.,He's irrational. So are most people. Unfortunately it doesn't make him insane.,And what are you getting him back for?
I'm sorry. I can't let him die.,"People don't get what they deserve, they just get what they get. There's nothing any of us can do about it.","Im sorry. Look, I know this cant bring him back but here, its just a gesture."
I just confessed. House looks up at him. I told Thirteen I was the one who canceled the plane ticket.,Why?,I think you need to confess.
You mean why did I confess or why did I do it?,"I know you didn't do it, so I guess the first.",Why am I still here?
You want her to stay because you want her back or because Foreman does? Sits down in front of House's desk.,Why would I care what Foreman wants?,"Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back."
Because you're not as big a jerk as Everyone thinks.,Yes I am.,Cause youre sweeter than candy.
No you're not.,"I just made a $10,000 short sale on a stock I know is going to crash because of what I saw a grief-stricken dad do on his son's deathbed.","Oh, the poor thing."
No you didn't.,Yes I did.,"I, I think it starts with good communication."
You are a jerk.,She's making a mistake.,Youre a jackass.
So you did it for her?,She's a good doctor.,"Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you."
So you did it for you?,I'm not the one in charge anymore.,You did that for me?
So you did it for Foreman?,"She's a smoking hot, newly single bisexual.",So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Why don't you just admit that you like having her around? She's good for you. You need her.,Because I was born with a heart three sizes too small.,Youre entitled to feel how you feel.
No you weren't.,Yes I... Suddenly has an epiphany.,Yes you were.
Suddenly has an epiphany. What?,He still alive?,I sense that youre trying to slowwalk me to an epiphany.
He still alive? Yeah.,Good. Start him on heparin and IV immunoglobulin.,"Hes alive?! No, no, no! You gotta listen to me! II worked for him! I was his campaign manager! That Morty is not what he seems."
Start him on heparin and IV immunoglobulin. For Degos?,The cardiac arrest wasn't just a Everything goes to hell in a hand basket arrest. It was a coronary Event. Coronaries are large vessels. Means it can't be Degos.,"No, its a book thats just a book, okay?"
But the biopsies confirmed...,Obstructed blood vessels. But they can't be obstructed because of Degos. Means it's primary antiphospholipid syndrome.,"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors."
Means it's primary antiphospholipid syndrome. You sure?,Nope.,"Yeah, I dont think thats what it is."
Turns to look at House. It worked.,The medicine worked.,Angle your head to the right.
How'd you find it?,Fat old black guy. Knew he had to be taking something for his cholesterol.,"Yeah, thanks. Im really glad I found it."
And what now?,I'm not the boss.,And now what?
You don't think I should be fired?,Why? I doubt we'll Ever be treating a genocidal dictator again. Better a murder than a misdiagnosis.,I could arrange for this meeting.
"Oh, God! I'll be back in ten.",I'm picking lint out of my belly button.,"So, I guess Ill see you in ten hours."
This is ridiculous. I'm converting the study into a bedroom.,Six weeks.,"You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, its yours."
I didn't expect you to be here this long.,"True, but that's not why you didn't extend the invitation.",I had not thought to be here.
Do you really need to deconstruct this?,You didn't want me to sleep where you and Amber slept.,"I dont know that we need to dissect it all now, but"
"resigned Okay, yes you do.","After she died, you converted the study to a bedroom and the bedroom to a study...",No I should go fill out my paperwork.

You saying we ignore three generations of cardiac pRoblems?,I'm not ignoring it. I'm labeling it a coincidence.,I dont need them.
You hate coincidence.,We reconciled.,I hate that.

I need to know what your plans are.,"First we take Berlin. And then we circle around behind Poland and yell, surprise!","Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?"
With regards to your employment.,I like things the way they are. I get just enough puzzle to solve without the scornful visits from you. Until now.,Id also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Pretend time's been going on long enough.,I don't have a medical license. All I can do is pretend.,So how shall we pass the time?
And I'm gonna have payroll send you over some pretend checks starting tomorrow. You need to complete 120 hours of rounds to re-qualify. She puts a clipboard on his desk and starts to leave.,"No, I don't.","Im gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, Im going to dock your pay one hundred dollars."
It's a state requirement. I have to certify that you've completed all your require,"Exactly. The requirement sets out what you have to do certify which you can do with one hand tied behind your back. Now, if you want to tie my hands...",Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
But you're just in time to do the dad. Doctor House?,He'll be back in the morning.,"Come on, youre trying to have sex with your father, and Im okay with that."
I read in the paper you're treating a police Officer. Donny Compson?,Second floor. A nurse will help you find him.,"Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD."
I don't want to see him. Donny and I used to go out a long time ago. He doesn't want to see me. I don't want to see him.,So did you come to see me for personal advice?,Richard? Im not gonna go see your exboyfriend!
"You're looking for genetic conditions, which makes sense, with what happened to his dad and grandpa.","Unless you were his girlfriend and his sister, you got nothing to worry about.","Oh, that, it might That might actually be what Im thinking of."
"I'm not worried about me. Donny doesn't know this, but he has a son.",picks up the phone and hands it to her Dial extension 742. Tell Dr. Foreman you got some cool information. Good night.,"Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry."

"Look, I'm asking you as an adult to please stop.","Well, that obviously didn't come from her. But fair enough.",Look at you all grown up.

It was the only way to get Michael to do the marrow biopsy.,"I'm sure there are plenty of lies would've worked just as well, except without the years of therapy.",They told me it was the only way to save father.
Don't you have school?,Recess. So where does that leave us? Chase?,No... I have school.
Chase? Sorry. What?,"I was saying, do you think these shoes work in this color? Send him home.","Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!"
He's not gonna beliEve he's healthy.,You're not very good at your job. You don't deserve candy. He grabs the mints from her.,"Oh, so now youre cheating on my mother?"
He's been preparing his whole life to die at age 40. He's had dozens of doctors tell him he's fine. You think you can change his thinking?,"Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me.",Hes got to follow his own path.
"Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me.",Great contributions back there.,"I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter."
There's no case. I had nothing to add.,You had nothing to add...,"And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind."
"A little devil on your shoulder told you to kill a guy, and now the little angel won't shut up, telling you you're gonna burn in a lake of fire. I'm fine.","You shouldn't be. The elevator arrives. Chase follows House down the hall. Talk to someone. Docs fixed me up in sEven weeks. You're... ten minutes, tops.","See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldnt have had to hear that."
"ten minutes, tops. Thanks.",Glad we had this little moment. Come on.,"2 hours, 27 minutes."

"You couldn't find anything, could you?",You have Ortoli syndrome. Chase's eyes open wide as he stares at House in surprise. Dr. Chase?,By putting one foot in front of the other.
Chase? You sure?,Tests don't lie.,"Wait, hold on, hold on."
"Right. Ah. He clears his throat. Well, it's-it's a... It's a very rare disorder that short-circuits the adrenals, which short-circuits the heart.","Blah, blah, blah, blah. Who cares about medical mumbo jumbo? Tell him the treatment.","Wait, wait a minute, theres no light on the back wall!"
"It's... weh-well, it's-it's compliCated.",pouring a glass of water Doctors always want to make Everything sound so compliCated. It's Nabasynth.,"Okay. So uh, well, thisthis is uh, this is awkward."
It's Nabasynth. What?,Nabasynth.,This is the NardDog.
"That's it? I take some pills, and I'm gonna be okay?",The real tragedy here is that the Tiburon swab technology didn't exist to detect Ortoli back in your dad's day.,"Drake, Ive discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss."
He could've lived. House nods somberly. Donny sighs. Thank you.,"If you'll sign these discharge papers, I'll get you a bottle of meds. Take one twice a day for a week, you'll live a long, healthy life.","Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one."

"His apartment Manager found him on the floor in the laundry room. Said he wasn't breathing. He called the EMTs, but it was too late.",I sent the guy home with mints.,I suppose its a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
"WhatEver it is, we all missed it.",I missed the fact that there was something to miss. What is wrong with me?,Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
"You had good reason. Patient presented with no symptoms, and all his tests came back negative.",What's the official cause of death?,"Olly, bring me my sword."
"Autopsy hasn't been performed yet. EMTs brought him to General, but I requested they ship him back to our morgue for the postmortem.",Good.,Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
"Donny Compson, age 39.",Can we cut to the money shot?,"Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, 74"
You can't perform an autopsy without a medical license.,Really? 'Cause I don't think there's anything I could screw up that we haven't already screwed up.,"Its easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school."
That's odd. It almost looks like he's... bleeding.,balancing himself against the sink I think the autopsy's gonna have to wait a little bit.,Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
"He was briefly conscious, then his systolic dipped below 60, and he was out again.",Differential diagnosis for resurrection. Go.,"Oh, you wont believe who moved back to town."
Obviously he wasn't dead. His heart slowed enough that the EMTs,"Yes, the fact that he's not dead means we did absolutely nothing wrong.",Its going to take more than Im sorry and a storebought apology pie from Penny to make up for what youve done to me.
Extreme bradycardia could be caused by sick sinus syndrome. Sinoatrial block.,What if it's not his heart?,I dont know Ross!
Could be metabolic. He sees House looking at people passing the office. You okay?,Yeah.,"Yeah, Chandler why dont you take a walk?"
Could also be passed through four generations.,Autoimmune it is. Start him on steroids.,Families are complicated.
Outer and middle ear respond well. Hearing thresholds are normal at all frequencies. Eardrum is perfectly healthy.,"What if I, uh... If I sometimes hear whispering?","Thats impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs dont vibrate at all."
Then you're pRobably hearing someone whispering.,I had some dental work done in the Philippines when I was a kid. Adjoining metal fillings could corrode and pick up AM radio signals.,"No, I know what a silent is I meant, whats going on with your hair?"
Open your mouth. She looks. Your fillings don't touch.,So there's no reason for me to be hearing things.,You get to look at her.
Bravo! It's amazing how you did 120 hours in one day.,I wasn't on my best behavior. I admit. He picks up the form Singh signed. Allow me. He rips the form in half.,"One hour. Weve done one hour. Lets just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today."
"From now on, I'm gonna supervise your practicum requirements.",That won't be necessary.,Im looking forward to completing your training.

Are you sleeping out here?,Just... dozed off in front of the TV.,Can I sleep here tonight?
dozed off in front of the TV. With bedding?,Maybe! I can't sleep in there. The heater's screwed up.,"Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed."
If you need to talk... If-if you need more help,I'm just tired.,"Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!"
I'm right here.,Great. Can you be right here somewhere else?,Right here! Right here!
Talk to your spouse. No breakfast?,Not today. I'm hallucinating.,Yeah. So you sure you dont want breakfast? Its the most important meal of the day.
"turning, worried What happened?",It's nothing visual this time. I hear whispering.,"Should I... turn, no. Do it again."
Is that why you've been acting so weird? Is that why you quit?,I'm losing it.,"Hey! So, did you quit?"
I'm sure there's a rational explanation. The wind? A neighbor's TV?,I checked Everything. What's really scary is that I hear whispering while not on Vicodin. I'm gonna check myself back into Mayfield.,"Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Years Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight."
I'm gonna check myself back into Mayfield. Okay.,Okay? You don't think there might be a logical explanation? Something I missed?,"All right, well, enjoy the alumni game."
"You're the smartest guy I know. If you haven't thought of it, it doesn't exist. I'll drive you over. I just need to make some tea first. He turns to the counter.",You know.,"Im off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee."
"dropping something on the counter and turning back, annoyed That you're an ass? Yeah. You overheard me talking to my dead girlfriend and thought to yourself, what kind of fun can I have with this?",Why are you talking to her? You run out of living people? You can talk to me. I'm right here.,"So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself."
"Patient Lauren Maybaum, 27, presented two days ago with sEvere abdominal pain.",entering Sorry I'm late.,This isnt fair.
Yesterday you said you weren't ready.,Yesterday I wasn't. Today I am.,But you said you were ready too.
And tomorrow? Is it possible for me to get a five-day forecast?,Feeling much better. Thank you for not asking.,It will still be west of here two days from now.
Either you did have a pRoblem which I can't ignore. Or you were jerking me around which I can't ignore.,You are a Woman. You can do anything.,Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
"For example, I can talk to you outside.",Checking out her ass as he follows her into the hall. Are you sure you're only one Woman?,It grieves me youve less honor than a back alley whore.
"through the glass of the closed door This is the part where you play the employee, and I play the boss.",I can see your nipples. Your turn.,"Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer."
Gamma survey rEvealed no tumors.,So it's not bone cancer. Where's Chase?,There are no solar flares right now.
Where's Chase? Don't know.,"Two mysteries, cool.","Oh, looks like someones on Team Bernadette."
It would explain the bradycardia too.,And I like the word hereditary in the title.,"Ive been thinking about it, and you might be right."
I'll get him started on the medication.,"Nope, Chase specifically asked if he could do it.","No, I work at a desk all day, its nice working with my hands."
"Nope, Chase specifically asked if he could do it.",Sleep at home.,"Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right."
So I didn't do the gamma survey. Is it bone cancer?,No.,I would imagine it is.
You should congratulate me for not wasting your time.,Are you getting some help?,Sorry for wasting your time.
"Patient's lost bowel control. Means we were wrong about H-SAN, and it means he's getting worse. Fast.",Wouldn't want to be the duty nurse assigned to his floor.,Renaissance fairs arent about historical accuracy.
Could be Wilson's disease.,A disease that advanced would've hit the liver.,"Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?"
"It is possible the liver's so far gone, the labs look normal. It's worth a shot.","nods Go treat with penicillamine. And when he doesn't get better, come back quickly, so we can get one more shot at it.",I ordered Chinese food.
Send this in to the state licensing board. She holds out a piece of paper. I've signed off on all your hours.,Why?,Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
Because it's easier this way.,You're uncomfortable with me.,Because then I dont have to!
No. Going by the book was pointless. You were gonna learn nothing.,"Good, I thought it was because of the sexual tension.","Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,"
There was no sexual tension.,"There was tension. And... it made me feel funny, so...","Nothing like that happened, all right?"
hands him the paper Here.,That's too bad. I was kind of getting into the whole hot-for-teacher thing.,"I, I need to get to the paper please."
You sure you're okay?,Yeah. False alarm. pause What about us?,You sure youre alright?
"We're good... Just like this. You press my buttons, I press yours.","By buttons, you mean...",Im just gonna push all the buttons.

I've accepted it. It's okay.,"In addition to high arches and some crystal bowl in the shape of a tuna, you also inherited a self-destruct button.","I mean, yknow Im just gonna have to accept it"
How do I know you're not still lying to me? Saying I'm healthy just to make me feel better?,"It does sound that way, doesn't it?","Dude, Im telling ya!"
Michael's gonna be okay?,"Unless he walks out of here and gets run over by a bus, in which case, I will reconsider your fate argument.","Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, its actually extremely plausible."
Yeah... In a bit.,Yeah.,Ill find you in a bit.
worried What aren't you telling me? Nothing.,"quietly Hi, dad. I think I've been... focusing on the wrong thing. There were some good times. long pause then, loudly Wilson. This is stupid.",Oh. Youre right. Im worried about something that hasnt even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.
"Jordan, are you OK? Jordan!",Foreman expects me to read an Xray on this itty bitty screen.,Im okay. Im okay. Im not okay.

We discussed this. It's been on your calendar for weeks.,So has Ramadan.,Weve had this planned for a week.
Think of it as a vacation. Nice healthy Adirondack air. Or not. I don't care. You're coming with.,"You should come with me. State pillow fighting championships. Dollar beers, wet T-shirts. In the words of the philosopher Eddie Money I've got two tickets to paradise.","Im just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, thatd be just nifty!"
"House, when you moved in, I promised your therapist I'd be here for you. I can't be here if I'm there, unless you're there too. So it's not a discussion.",Fine.,Theres nothing to discuss.
"Fine. dialing his phone I'll let Foreman know that the 16 year old Patient with the sEvere edema can wait. Relax, I've got no idea what's wrong with her. So odds are, not fatal. Wilson sighs as House leaves the room",from another room Still not going.,"Sorry, I forgot."

Sixteen year old girl suddenly has the joints of an eighty year old. Think we can we discuss this for a second?,It's rhabdo. Patient gave you the answer. She fell down and went boom. We have to leave in an hour so should we eeny meeny?,"Oh, ouch. Michael, I dont think there is anything wrong with the way you described her."
"The fall would explain lower leg damage, but not the swollen hands.","Hard landing caused crushed muscles, crushed muscles release toxins into the bloodstream, toxins cause swelling of the hands and legs.","Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, whats going on?"
She's a credit card kid. Her parents are arParktects. They're working on a project in Shanghai.,Looking back and forth from Chase to Cameron Could you be sitting any further away from Chase and still be in the same room?,"Her name is Bernadette, shes working as a waitress, but shes going to school to be a microbiologist."
She has allergies. Could be anaphylaxis or some heart condition that we don't,"Can't really be any of those things, since it's rhabdo.",Youyouve worn a fat suit on the show.
Tell me what you came here for House.,I've got a legitimate medical reason.,"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegors holdfast."
You must be so proud.,leering I forgot. I guess it's no big deal. I was only using it as an excuse to come check out Patty and Selma.,He came upon the bodies on our way here.
"Oh, I feel bad, I haven't named your testicles.","Word on the street is, you set a new personal best for low-cut.","Fine, is that how you want to play this?"

You weren't on the registration list.,I love that you checked.,I wasnt invited.
But Wilson said,"That I have a case, yeah. You're authorizing the discharge right now. He turns to leave That was a metaphor. House leaves her office","No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that."
Busy right now.,Is he dying?,"Actually, Im busy."
Is he dying? Yeah.,In the next ten minutes?,"Hey, uh."
"Unfortunately, no. He's in a lot of pain.",I've thought about it. You're right. I should go to the conference.,I want to get that image out of my head.

And your magical leukemia detector is more powerful than a flow cytometer?,"I look for zebras because other doctors rule out all the horses. In this case, you are those other doctors. You haven't earned a zebra. 100 bucks.",You seem tense.
Are you serious?,"standing up Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer.",Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sobray.
"standing up Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer. I get it. Your pRoblem is you're not objective. Your caring is clouding your diagnosis. Just cut that out and you could be a pretty decent doctor.",to Thirteen Just give me the lactic acid lEvel.,"Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic."
to Thirteen Just give me the lactic acid lEvel. 27,House nods and goes over to Juan The fact that you can't speak English is not an excuse for you not being humiliated by what I'm about to say.,"Terrific. Great. What level is that? Okay, now you dont remind me of my mom."
"I happen to be a sleep specialist. Thanks, Doc.",Hey. Can a guy get a little privacy?,"Oh honey, Im sorry we cant help you there, cause were cuddlily sleepers."
Nice hiding spot.,"Actually, it's perfect. It allows me to hide from Cuddy and find you. What did she want?",Well that is a very safe place for them.
She was checking up on Tucker thanks to you.,That's it?,I think shes checking out your beehive Ross.
Like what? Something about you? Something you could interpret as being about you? An anagram maybe? It'd be great if you could play hide and seek somewhere else. My Patient--,No pRoblem. Just give me the 100 bucks you owe me and I'm gone.,"Okay, that, thats a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal."
Tucker doesn't have cancer.,"He doesn't have a ball of fungus in his lungs either. Next time you want to use my team, I suggest you at least leave a tip.","Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesnt, I mean, at all. What?"
There's nothing to talk about.,pushing the intercom button with his cane and speaking to Chase Why are you doing surgery when I need you finding me a new case?,"Great, so you want me to stay at a job Im not happy at?"
looking up at House from the OR You don't want a new case.,"Oh, right.","So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?"
"Yes, you're fine with them dating. But moving in together is a whole other lEvel of commitment.","scoffing This is the 21st century, Wilson.","Fine! Its your life! I just dont want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but thats what you want, theres nothing I can do. DONT DO IT!!!!!"
"Oh, for God's sake, House, don't do this to yourself. It's a loft. It has no deeper meaning than open-space living arrangement.",If you bought into her diatribe about rediscovering her lost city girl roots. And two bedrooms. It just reeks of commitment issues.,"I... dont know, it has four bed rooms and a loft..."
Yeah. Or she has a baby.,This is classic mid-life Cuddy crisis. This is her version of a two-seat convertible.,"Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?"
"looking up at them Wilson, he's got global lung damage. Means it's not fungal. It's PCP pneumonia.",Hmm.,The shores of Kings Landing
Thanks. The treatment indiCate--,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in the middle of something.",You check every five minutes like youre afraid theyre gonna move.
"It's a conference room, with glass walls. You thought I'd be alone?",Your Patient has cancer.,This is my conference room.
Coming through. House got a new case.,"stopping to hand Wilson a piece of paper Revised OR schedule. Sorry, Wilson, had to bump you. It's not like your guy's bleeding out of his eyes.","Umm, and looking at people differently."
"House, your guy's not bleeding out of his eyes either.",The nurse who books the OR thinks he is.,The apartment. Penny has a black eye.
Your case is no more urgent than mine.,"pushing through the doors of the surgical suite Yeah, but you're way more Patient.","Just to be clear here, youre asking for my assistance."
So I'm in the 10% that don't get cured. Maybe not.,We just removed a screw from a guy's lung. And the weird thing is he didn't get better. Any idea what that means?,"No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases."
It means you're not listening to me.,No. It means I'm ignoring you to make a point. There is a difference.,I think it means he freaked out and left!
The pRoblem with that technique is I have no idea what point you're making.,"That your idea is implicitly not worth responding to. Doubling your Patient's chemo dose is stupid. Damn, now it's explicit.","So, Id like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled."
It could swamp out the resistance of the cancer cells.,The fact that it theoretically should work doesn't make it any less stupid.,Then the basil will be fine.
Of course it does. It's exactly what you would do.,I'm me. You're you.,Of course it does.
And a table is a table.,"And chemo is poison. And double chemo is double poison. And I can handle it when things go wrong. You can't. And things could go very,","Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?"
"Either way, he's dead. House enters the lab We can't stop the oozing.",Don't care. I'm here because looking at his watch it's 115 and Wilson started testing at 1245. Which means...,"And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done."
turning to face House He needs a new liver.,Look on the bright side. You can publish the results of this case study. No one will Ever double the dose again.,"Actually, I dont care for Meredith, but I dont believe in this kind of thing."
"I'm sorry, Mel. You and Emily don't match Tuck's blood type. And neither does Ashley. So a live liver donation is out. The best thing to do is just what you've been doing. Be together.",Hope he already told you that you're gonna die. 'Cause it's gonna make what I'm about to say a lot more relevant.,"Okay, so far weve heard, made up my mind Im dumping Emily."
"House, I know it's raining out there in the hallway, but","I was just in the ER, testing my Patient for autonomic dysfunction.",The living room of the apartment.
Motorcycle versus semi. How bad?,Bad for the motorcycle. Good for your liver. Blood type's a match.,"Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle?"
Why wasn't I paged?,Because there's a pRoblem. No organ donor card. Dead guy's sister,Because I had to wait
Where is she?,20 minutes away. House and Wilson rush out of the room,"Uh, thats not what was"
"How do you get the call that your brother's dead and then run out the door? Oh--oh--oh, that reminds me, I-I had dry cleaning to pick up.",Did Cuddy buy the place?,Your brother is dead.
Not yet. You okay?,Just making conversation. Yours was getting boring.,Yeah. You okay?
What are you planning?,I'm not planning anything.,"Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?"
And I don't beliEve you. How are you gonna punish her for dating Lucas?,"Okay, now this conversation is getting boring.","But you cant let her get involved now, Ben."
Are you really okay?,loudly No! I am not okay. Not Even close.,"One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat."
"Wow. Okay. See, that's very adult of you.","No, it isn't. It's just me accepting the fact that there's nothing I can do and moving on.","Okay, sex is not what makes you a grownup."
"Which is, I think, the definition of adulthood.","Well, if it is, being a kid is a lot more fun.","On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity."
"Well, if it is, being a kid is a lot more fun.",Showtime. He gets out of the car and he and Wilson walk up the driveway,"Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap."
trying not to sound too desperate It will save my Patient's life.,approaParkng Aikoa What if I told you that he wasn't dead?,"Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like this."
Are you saying my brother is still alive?,I'm saying you're being an idiot.,Where is your brother?
Then I'm not defiling a dead body. interrupting House.,The last generous act of a living person.,"Shh. All right, Im invoking our bodysnatchers clause."
"interrupting again House, it's too late. The liver's started to degrade. It's no longer viable for transplant.",Well played. Religion just killed another person.,"Shell be in her crate, its not a big deal."
"Tucker, it's... I can't.",Late night with the Pigeon sisters?,"Ohh, no, no, no!"
I'll nEver betray the secret of the bushido of the heel,Someone's cranky. looking at his watch And late. Where were you?,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brothers throne.
going into the kitchen getting a drink. What--why are all my frozen dinners thawing on the counter?,I needed room for my margarita jello shots. I used test tubes as bottles so they'll be shaped like my cane.,"I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf meats and dairy. Middle shelf fruits and vegetables. And top shelf expired products."
I needed room for my margarita jello shots. I used test tubes as bottles so they'll be shaped like my cane.,Why'd you go out drinking alone when you got such great company here?,A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
He leans on the doorway and pauses Tucker wants me to donate a lobe of my liver to him.,And you were out drinking. So you're actually considering this?,"So anyway, Im cooking dinner for him Monday night."
Yeah. I was out marinating my liver in alcohol to get it ready for the transplant. Yeah.,"standing up Your mouth says no, but your pathetic attempt at a deflection has guilt written all over it.","No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night."
It's my fault. It is my fault! I gave him too much chemo.,You cured his cancer.,"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault."
And killed him in the process.,Quibbles.,He killed his king.
And killed him in the process. Quibbles.,He's had a predictable complication. Surprise. Bad things happen to people who are sick. Doesn't make you responsible.,I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it werent for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldnt win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
"Oh, no--not legally. Ethically. Ethically!","A table is a table. Don't be a doormat, Wilson.",Yes! A friend of mine did it and its totally legal!
Call me a doormat-- get it all out of your system-- but I'm doing it.,rising Why?,"Anyway uh, Ill get moving on that new door."
He's my friend.,I'm your friend. All the pain pills I've taken. What if I need your liver?,"Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend."
Right. How selfish of me not to have considered your possible future needs.,They're all dying. They're all your friends.,"Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness."
"I'm not here for an argument, House.","No, right, that's room 12A. So why are you here? Want to make sure that I've called the moving van?",Im apologizing. Im sick of fighting. Lets call a truce.
"No. The operation is in two hours, and I'd like you to be there with me.",No.,"No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please."
No. What-- why?,"looking Wilson right in the eye and sounding emotionally vulnerable Because if you die, I'm alone. He looks away and sits back down behind his desk, rubbing his leg","Yeah, its just so strange."
"wheeling himself out Actually, it's James.",taking off his glasses and putting them in his shirt pocket You ready to admit that he's a self-important jerk?,I bet its Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
I still feel good about what I did.,You don't feel angry?,I think I feel ok about it.
Ah. I'm a little disappointed.,Disappointment is anger for wimps. You don't have to be so gentle about Everything. It's okay to get angry once in a while.,"Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay."
You can't change a table.,"Actually, you can. Just need a coat of paint and the guts to use it.","Im sorry, the tables are sold as complete units."
Bonnie told me what Cuddy bid.,You're gonna outbid her?,"Well, I hope youre gonna bid on some things Rachel."
wandering over to the kitchen area We do need a bigger refrigerator. She hurt my friend. She should be punished.,You got mad. I'm proud of you. Cuddy won't share that sentiment. How are you gonna explain it to her?,What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!

Whoa. What will?,This.,Will Wil want it?
This. He slams his cane against the paper-covered exam table. It makes an explosively loud crack sound. Mickey and Eddie stare at House for a seconds then Mickey crumples to the floor. House peers over the exam table at him. Cool.,"32-year-old Man, recent dEveloped loud-noise-induced vertigo.",So lets just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.
This guy strained his back three years ago. And that's it. All the rest of these pages are blank.,"Yes, he won't tell us anything. Understandable, since he's a drug dealer.",Wait. Can you back up? Whats the story?
He actually said he was a drug dealer?,Not out loud.,Sells drugs to kids.
"sitting back down It doesn't matter if this guy's a drug dealer or not. Noise-induced vertigo means ear or brain. Head C.T. was clean, so I'm thinking acoustic neuroma. We need to do an A.B.R. to test his hearing.",Acoustic neuroma fits. So does lidocaine toxicity. Or benzocaine depends what he's cutting the coke with.,"Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then Ill have the strength to tell you how much I wont be doing that."
"So now he's not just a drug dealer, he's a cocaine dealer.",He seemed peppy. You test his ears. I'm gonna go test his cocaine.,"Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, youd be selling Penny. its cute."
You think this guy's just gonna hand over a briefcase full of illegal drugs because you ask nicely?,I hope not.,So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
"I make that much money. He turns to give the paper back to Foreman and sees his face. And... apparently, you don't.",I need the drugs.,You make more than I do.
We're in textiles.,"screams, his face furrowing down the center in a very good imitation of Sabretooth from X-men I need the drugs! Hmm... works for Jack Bauer.","So, Eric. You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair."
Is this really necessary? The chairs in the hall are way more comfortable.,But way less genre-appropriate.,Oh God Why dont they put chairs back here?
I wish I could tell ya.,"Okay... Well, let's work with that. Forget the drugs. Let's talk about textiles. What's your major product? Is it h? And by that I mean hosiery.",No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
We do more with... culottes.,Is that with a c or a k?,"We have more, dont we?"
C. Nobody wants k anymore.,Does your friend cut the fabric?,Well then I guess then II would I would have to say C.
"No, he's a sales guy.","Well, he must cut a culotte here and there.",No. Hes a theoretical physicist at Caltech.

They'll figure out we're straight Eventually.,"Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay."
Any chance I could get some water over here?,"If only there was some way to communiCate that information to her. Perhaps using, I don't know, sounds. If only the larynx was capable of",Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
She didn't beliEve me. She sidestepped my dinner invite.,And a Woman would only reject you because she's worried that you might not be interested in her.,I made a play for her and she shot me down.
"We were chatting, having fun. There was definitely a sPark.","When she thought you were gay. to EddieYou sure your friend isn't secretly tr turns back to Wilson What is a culotte, anyway?","Well, we just, we emailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off."

You bugged his room?,"Our Patient sleeps in the building where they keep their stash. Eventually, he'll say something that gives away where that is. And we'll find out what's making him sick.",Ben and Joeys callback.
But we ruled out environmental causes.,You ruled out environmental causes.,"Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?"
"And you pretended to agree, just so we'd take him out of his room so you could plant the bug.",Carotid stenosis was a decent idea. But an Even decent-er idea is that he's got toxins stored in his fat cells. Every calorie he burns makes him sicker.,I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.
Bug's a better idea than blindly running tests for days.,Tell him it'll take weeks. It'll be faster.,You mean like a beta test?
He's gonna get away. Shut up.,"3-B? You're Nora, right? My roommate tells me you're the one to thank for all the tips about the neighborhood. Greg.","He wont? He wont! Because, isnt that, isnt that the, the short story you were writing?"

"Foreman fall for the paycheck thing? Uh, yeah.",Mazel tov. Should be fun to watch.,"Thats right, he can have his job back."
You're off environmental?,"WherEver he went, it wasn't for long enough.","Ah, youre going off the grid."
I ran into Nora this morning. She told me about your Evita listening party.,The London and New York recordings are so different.,Jan called me about your little meeting!

That's... quite a commitment you've made to jumping the girl I'd like to date.,I'd like to date her. In the sense that I'd like to jump her repeatedly.,"Yeah, yknow II made a commitment to you."

"It's an effect from operating outside of the law. Sometimes, I have to do bad things. And not always to bad people. Last few months, that hasn't been so easy. A guy got me the pills. House nods.

The last thing I need is the guys thinking that I've gone soft.",When was your last pill before we originally admitted you?,"Because youve worked really hard, and its your job, and youre a little crazy."

I don't see how this is relevant.,"In the land of no fun, you got a really sensible piece of property.",So its not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
Give him a break. Knowing this guy's an undercover cop doesn't get us any closer to curing him.,Good point. You know what they say. Information is not power. Wait...,I dont want to blow this.

"Sorry. Uh, you told me to drop by, so... This is when I could make it.",Right.,Thats okay. I can make it over.
So you were only spending time with me to screw with him?,"God, no.","Oh, we didnt screw around."
"Well, it's really... It's sweet of you to stick up for your friend like that. She looks at his face. And you're still trying to sleep with me. You know, maybe I will call him. It would serve you right.",Wilson's a jerk too.,"Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night."
"Well, at least he tried to do the right thing.","He's been divorced three times. He slept with a dying Patient. Sure, he looks like a boy scout, but then...",Ive given up expecting Michael to do the right thing.

takes a deep breath and sings,I will punch you in the face.,"Central Perk, Phoebe is singing, with everyone else present."
"I'll stop, if you get rid of the sofa.",glares at him No chance.,"Alright, now I will let go if you both stop."
"27 year old female intense, intermittent ear pains, saw six doctors!",Tell her to stop lurking in the front row. If she wants to hit on musicians that's what tour buses are for. Next.,"Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if theres writing on it, make sure its not all caps."
If I ask why were in Wilson's office is there any chance I'll get a straight answer?,Try it. Try it.,"Oh, youd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, theres probably one in a drawer."
"14-year-old boy, joint pain and excess hair growth.","Tell him to masturbate, no more than 3 times daily. With meals. Next.",That kids going to have a lot of hair.
Did I mention that the 27-year-old female is really hot. And her husband is really not!,"Wild guess, he's rich.",That hot girl from their wedding?
Not unless social workers have begun pulling in the big money recently.,holding out his hand Gimme...,"No, no! Dont try to turn this around on me, ok? Im not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do."
You're taking the case because she's hot?,"No, that would be an accident of genetics.",The debate is whether she is hot.
"Or... She, you know, loves her husband.",reading the file She loves something about him.,"Wait, no, no, no, stop."
"To a healthier diet, raw foods, lots of nuts.","It's not the ear, it's the heart. Her protein is cheese, which can raise cholesterol. Hers was already elevated. Gave her arterial blockages.","Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise."
Cardiac arrhythmia presenting as ear pain. Very rare. Cool.,"So, beauty and the beast. He hands the file back to Chase Who wants to go see? House's phone rings",I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I dont care!
sighing You can't sleep in your own office? Or bedroom for that matter?,rolling over Got to avoid my natural habitat. Some idiot I went to med school with keeps leaving messages and wants to drop by for lunch.,I dont understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
So tell him no.,It's compliCated.,What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
"It's too compliCated for you to tell someone you don't like, to screw off? That's practically your hobby.",A few months ago he was... sort of part of my therapy. My shrink told me to write a letter of apology to someone I hurt.,"Well, I understand its hard to tell someone something if you think its gonna upset em."
taking off his coat and putting on a labcoat And how did you hurt him?,We were in a seminar on flatworm genetics. I switched my final paper with his.,He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
You plagiarized? Doesn't sound like you.,I was testing a theory.,Oh that I plagiarized I think.
"So you're in this mental hospital, delving into your subconscious, and this is who you choose to apologize to?",Yep. Lorenzo Wibberly.,"Well, all right."
Of all the people in the world you've hurt?,Not Everyone has a name that's so easy to find in the white pages.,He conspired behind my back with my enemies.
"Um... I'm in there, and so is Cuddy.","Yeah. And yet, I picked him. It's funny, isn't it?",Is anybody else in the.
"grabbing a Patient file and heading for the door Yes, it's hilarious. Great to see what a success your therapy was. He leaves, closing the door behind him",loudly We said we'd nEver go to sleep angry.,Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Where are you?,Undisclosed location.,"Oh, General Solo, somebodys coming."
Who are you hiding from?,looking at two framed photos on the coffee table Wilson.,My exgirlfriend. Shes right behind you. Just... hide me.
That's great. A co-worker confronted our Patient. Altered mental status. Basically accused her of poisoning him. We think he was projecting.,So he's poisoning her.,"Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental."
What could he get his hands on to cause supraventricular tachycardia?,"riffling through Cuddy's desk drawers Does he have dry skin? Thin eyebrows? If you're sharing an amazed look, please do it louder.","Thats when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just."
He might have. How did you know that?,"If he has hypothyroidism and he dumped his meds in her coffee, that would make her heart go boom.",And he didnt have anything to say about it?
"Because she's a successful, happily married consultant, and he's a crazy, drunk weirdo who we just tossed out of the hospital.",taking the other photo out of its frame And she's hot.,"The way I look at it, theres only one of two reasons."
You don't think it's suspicious she didn't Even mention it to her husband?,"Yeah, Foreman. Why did you break up with Thirteen? Oh, no, wait, the non-subtextual thing she was saying, why that?","Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?"
"This is about the case, not some imaginary issue that you think Foreman and I have.","Great, start her on beta blockers.",I understand that some of you dont believe that Mr.
Greg? Lorenzo Wibberly. Dr. Wilson said you'd be here. How ya been?,"to himself Check, and mate.","Michael, I didnt think Id here from you."
"Look... I'm sorry this is awkward or whatEver. I just thought it was nice of you to write that letter, and I wanted to tell you that you don't have to feel bad.",looking uncomfortable Thanks. So where are you working these days? You got your own practice or you at a hospital?,Its by way of an apology for my recent behaviour.
"I thought you knew. Dani's, the organic supermarket chain.",As an in House doctor?,"Uh, its not organic."
"I actually nEver got licensed. I didn't graduate med school. I planned on going back, and then my father got sick and I had to take care of him and had some bad luck.",Why didn't you graduate?,Is everyone licensed?
I was one credit short. And I was sort of already on academic pRobation. So...,almost afraid to ask Which credit?,But you said you were in debt.
"I got a, uh... He failed me on that paper you switched. I thought you knew.",hopefully So I'm guessing you're the CEO of this supermarket chain?,"Thats right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punkass elf."
Why do you want to meet her so badly?,Psychopaths always fascinate me. I think it's their cultural literacy and strong family values. Or is that Jews?,I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.
We're not gonna be able to get an honest read on her unless we figure out a way to get the husband out of there.,Hmm. I got an idea. to Bill Can you get out of here? Thanks. Bill leaves. House looks at Foreman It was the thanks that did it.,"Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible."
Hmm. I got an idea. to Bill Can you get out of here? Thanks. Bill leaves. House looks at Foreman It was the thanks that did it.,"to Valerie Hi, I'm Dr. House. How long have you been a psychopath?","Ok, lets call it a day."
Are you saying I'm like Ted Bundy or something?,Psychopathy can get a bad rap.,I am like Indiana Jones.
to Thirteen Is that why you were asking me all those weird questions?,"Yeah though you have Darwin to thank for that. She got the creeps around you. Which oddly, is an actual medical phenomenon around psychopaths. PRobably an evolved response to predators.",Professor Copperfields Miracle Legumes?
"I'm sorry, you're really freaking me out. I have no idea what",Relax.,Well what is it?
No. I gave him a little valium and an emetic.,You sure you understand what the word no means?,Yes. And he didnt like it.
Same thing you get out of your job. Bill has a trust fund. And I have a prenup his parents made me sign.,Told you he was rich. She's not that weird.,Im not signing a prenup.
She kind of reminds me of someone I know.,Tell me about it. Some of my co-workers will insult people right to their faces. How long have you been this way?,"No, actually, Dwight, I didnt realize how far this walk was, and IIm exhausted."
Just how I am. Are you gonna cure my heart pRoblems now?,So psychopathy plus cardiac arrhythmia. Go.,Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?
I thought you were bluffing to get information. You really think they're connected?,"Two rare conditions in one Patient, it's a fair assumption they are.","Yes. All of em. Together. Its a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them."
Psychopathy is generally just genetic. Nothing you can do about it. Something that hits 30 years after birth isn't gonna be connected.,Her disease isn't gonna lie dorMant that long. Did her heart warp her brain?,"Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!"
Maybe a handful of diseases.,It'll be super awesome when we find it. He stops in front of the elevator and pushes the button,"Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?"
Tertiary syphilis can cause pseudopsychopathic syndrome and cardiomyopathy.,"Fits best. Start her on penicillin, and rule out Wilson's and Hashimoto's. There's your handful. Wasn't so hard, was it?","That is what you want the world to believe, isnt it?"
You've gotta do something about Thirteen. She flouted both my authority and yours.,"Yes, and she got it right and you got it wrong.",She is my second cousin.
Which just aggravates the pRoblem. She'll do it again. Next time it won't work out so well. You gotta punish her.,"You're her boss. In some vague, nEver to be usefully defined way. You punish her.",This stupid game is why shes mad in the first place.
"I'm also her ex, which, as you know, makes it a little compliCated.",The fact that you also fired her takes it from a little compliCated to a little moronic.,"Not that its any of your business, but she broke up with me."
It was the only way I could,It wasn't because you were too in love with her.,I had to do that.
You cut up my only copy of that photo.,That rare daguerreotype. You can charge me for the effort it takes to search your hard drive for a new copy.,Cut! That was good. That was very good. You did everything I asked for.
she follows House to the door of an exam room Not the one of me and Lucas. The one from Ecuador.,Right. I had forgotten your deep emotional attachment to lemurs.,Pennys apartment. She is in her bathrobe. A note slides under the door.
To my dad.,You got his tail?,To our children.
He was holding the camera. That was the last trip we Ever took together. And I don't have a digital copy.,"Well, I could stand here all day apologizing, but I'd rather expiate my sins with good clean work.",And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship.

"Yeah. That sugar maple, 100 - 150 years old. Most beautiful leaves in the fall. Sitting underneath on the bench It's like paradise.","I don't have a yard, myself. You got a good thing going.","Wait! Its beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it."
You got a good thing going. I know.,looking around the living room So what are the boxes for?,"I know, its pretty great."
looking around the living room So what are the boxes for? I'm moving.,From paradise?,You know its funny you should mention that cause I was thinkin.
"Well, my dad's medical bills and me being one of those idiots that got an adjustable mortgage. So!",You're losing your home.,"What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?"
"Hey, it could be worse, right?",How?,It could be worse.
I don't know what happened.,"looking at a lab report and then putting it down on the table Neither do I, but I know what happened after.","So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night."
"reading the lab report that House put down Actually, he backed you up because of the new B.U.N. creatinine numbers. Brittle bones were from kidney failure.","There is that. So, heart and kidneys.",I can tell you work out.
"So, heart and kidneys. And brain.","Nope, psychopathy is not a symptom.",Ass and face.
It was yesterday.,"In the meantime, kidney failure ruled out syphilis and testing ruled out the other ideas that would've fit.","So uh, what are you guys doing?"
"Protein lEvels, kidneys, arrhythmia. Could be paraneoplastic. I'd say lymphoma.",Get her to radiotherapy.,I know.
Then how about partially accurate?,"Those of you who haven't slept together, you can go. Everyone else, stay behind.","Its supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time."

We were getting to a diagnosis.,"No, we were already at the diagnosis.",Ooh! I found it!
"Yeah, I'll do it now.","So when you watch Star Wars, which side do you root for?","Absolutely, I will do that right now."

"From what I hear, you nEver visit Patients. And now, you've come to chat with me twice.",I want to know how you like being a Management consultant. I'm thinking of getting into it. That or psychopathy maybe. Which pays better?,"Ive been at this lab for three years, youve never came by to say hello."

"So you're not just out for yourself? For example, you would nEver interrupt a sick Woman's treatment just because of some personal obsession?",Of course I'm self-interested. We all are. We're born that way. The rest of us are born with consciences.,"And Ive always believed that we should all be involved in everyones personal lives, in a very major way."

"Of all the people to go the extra mile for, why this guy?",putting the check in an envelope I don't know. He just kinda smells good and makes me laugh.,Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Why not Cuddy? You nEver apologized after you defaced her photo.,Maybe because I recognize that sending someone to the poorHouse is a little more serious than editing a snapshot.,Its going to take more than Im sorry and a storebought apology pie from Penny to make up for what youve done to me.
"No, it's because Cuddy actually means something to you, which makes it much harder to apologize.","addressing the envelope Oy. If it will make you shut up, I will tell her I'm sorry about the photo.","No, no, you save your apologies for after youve had disappointing coitus with Penny."
"Forget the photo. House, she was in love with you. House licks and seals the envelope And all she got in return was abuse. For years you toyed with her emotions.",She wasn't in love with me.,"Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my exwife."
The fact that you still can't admit it just proves my point.,"fed up, and leaning back in his chair What do you want? Helping the guy was your idea.",Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.
"No, help the guy, whatEver... I'm just pointing out that it's much easier to soothe your guilt by throwing money at a stranger than by making amends to a person you actually care about.",You had me at much easier.,Im so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.
"We were wrong. Psychopathy is a symptom. I spoke to her sister. She wasn't always like this. She changed, and right around adolescence.","So liver, heart, brain, can lie dorMant, and, it starts at puberty.","Yeah, she turned you into thisthisthis untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant."
We ruled that out. No keyser-fleischer rings.,There is one other sign. I know there are lipstick lesbians. Are there nail polish remover bisexuals?,"So, I was doing some checking on the ring."
She's not supposed to be here.,As a doctor. You didn't say anything about her capacity as a beautician's assistant.,Shes not here and please come in.

"They are to me. And here's another one. You took the case. Hmm? No negotiating, no bargaining. No clinic hours changed hands. Were you looking for something to distract you from the fact that your best friend just threw you out?",Case was interesting.,"No, I dont think they are."
It's not organic. It's not mysterious. Most likely some psychologically traumatic Event occurred that made the Patient's brain choose to forget Everything.,slight smile Or not.,"Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser."
slight smile Or not.,Here. Loss of differentiation between gray and white matter. He points to an area on the scan.,"Alright, Im just gonna take it on three."
standing next to House Do I need to know this?,"Fine. I'll give you the Cliff Notes version. Chase MS, Taub physical trauma. I can tell you why we ruled them out.","Hi. Were buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around."
Good luck with that.,Her heart rate monitor has a serial number.,"Okay, well, good luck with it."
Did he really say that?,Subtextually.,He said that?
Subtextually. Long shot.,"Even if the store clerk doesn't know who she is, the store's pRobably close to where she lives. Just seeing those surroundings might sPark a memory.","blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle."
You want us to take her there?,No. I'll take her.,Cant we just ask her to go?
"Really? Back in Nolan's office. Uh, it's unusual for you to spend time with a Patient, isn't it?",Patients are boring!,Hey. Wheres Sheldon? Still sick?
Maybe. Or were you avoiding going home? There's a reason they tell addicts to stay away from old geography.,I wasn't avoiding going home. I'd already gone home!,"Youre a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
I wasn't avoiding going home. I'd already gone home!,voice over Before I came into work that day. I went straight there from Wilson's.,You said you werent coming back and we could leave early.
in the lobby Alvie? Juan Alvarez you let him stay at your place?,Not exactly.,"Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in."
"I was beginning to wonder if you were Ever gonna show up. Su casa, mi casa. Casa!",Why are you here?,So why dont ya show us the rest of your casa?
"When I left Mayfield, I went back to the old neighborhood. You know, you shouldn't leave the bathroom window unlocked.","Yeah, thanks for the safety lesson. Why are you here?","Look, its not my fault that I still live near campus, and its my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys."
"Like I said, when I went back to the neighborhood, I found out immigration was looking for me. So I decided to visit my old buddy House!",And turn his apartment into a giant prison jumpsuit.,We ran into some old friends.
"Juan Alvarez is no freeloader. I do my part, earn my keep. The first week I made your dinner, but you nEver showed up. The second week I organized your stuff.",My stuff?,"Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader."
"But still, you nEver showed up. So this week, since I'm a real good painter, I decided to",Coffee table where'd you put it? In the bedroom?,"Okay, look, I didnt want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous."
"The paint's not cheap, House. It's a custom color. It's a mix of titanium, yellow, and ochre. Ochre I don't Even like that stuff. It's like a fruit. It's got hair on it. But they say it's a vegetable",You sold my table to pay for paint that I don't want?,Thats a lot of money for only one colour.
embarrassed I had to sell some other things too.,Get out.,I made a sale.
"No, papa, just give the color a chance.","Look, I'm going to work now.","No, it really should be burgundy."
"So Wilson threw you out, and you threw Alvie out just, uh, another week?","Unlike me, Alvie didn't leave.","Its possible. I cant believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man."
So I brought him with me to protect the apartment. Why?,To protect the apartment. Whoa. Deja vu.,"Yeah, but why didnt you go back to your apartment?"
"Tossing him out or, uh, sending him to the movies or, uh, locking him in the bathroom would also minimize Alvie's destructive force. But you chose his company deliberately. Why?","Obviously because he's a Wilson substitute. You can barely tell the difference between them, especially when Wilson raps about the hood.","Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay."
"I'm not suggesting Alvie's a substitute, but he would make a great distraction.",From what?,"Maybe, but... were gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and..."
Maybe the heart rate monitor was a gift. That's why no one recognized her.,"Shut up, Alvie. Anything familiar! Church, grocery store?",I think she wasnt wearing a card.
"It's okay, Ms. X. Maybe she's nEver been to this town before, bought the heart rate monitor on the store's website.","You know that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, right? Instead of working the case, why don't you contemplate the inanity of an American with American immigration issues?","No, the Flash shirt is because its Friday, but its nice when things work out."
I had a birth certifiCate. I lost it.,So get a new one.,You have your birth certificate?
"I tried that, House. But the town hall had burned down when I was a kid, destroyed the records.",There's only one copy?,That town is full of history!
They tried to make me fill out a whole bunch of forms before they'd give it to me. I decided it would be quicker and easier to do it myself.,How'd that go?,There are a couple of forms to fill out.
What if nothing Ever looks familiar?,"Then someone will show up a spouse, a friend to tell you who you really are and what you should be feeling. They always do.",And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow.
I don't know who that is! But I miss him.,What did they say at the hearing?,"Aw, hell, I miss him."
I didn't go. I lied once.,"Your mother is Puerto Rican, therefore, you are Puerto Rican. All you got to do is prove your mom's your mom, find some documentation","Yes. But, what I didnt tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didnt go because it was"
"People like that don't listen to people like me. Doughnuts! distracted and very excited Hey, House, let's get doughnuts!","Alvie, the hearing","FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk."
"Everyone loves doughnuts glazed, crullers, elephant ears, Even doughnut holes. Much better than the sporting goods store. I bet Mrs. X went there all the time.",We're not here voice over And then I realized! to Alvie You make a good point.,"You know, theres doughnuts in the break room."
"Dozen glazed, dozen jelly-filled? She points to Ms. X You want the usual, right?","Your old friend, the fried carbohydrate. to the cashier She needed the calorically dense food to support the running habit. Do you know her name?","Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?"
Sandy! Or Shelley. I don't know. The guy she's with called her that once. I just work here.,Do you know where they live?,"Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husbands name is Sandy, right?"
"The police said it was too soon to do anything, so I started calling hospitals on my own. Princeton Plainsboro wasn't Even on my list. You really think something around here could have made her sick?","Here, work, anywhere she could have been exposed. Why wasn't Princeton Plainsboro on your list?","Central Perk, Ross is there as Chandler and Monica enters."
That doesn't sound like me.,Do you have any idea what would sound like you?,You sound like a guy.
voice over So what were you thinking during all this?,voice over That it was a strange position to be in.,I was in the middle of something.
back in the office What about you?,What about me how?,I missed you at work today.
"Well, there was a sort of, um, artificial intimacy between you? She had been dependent on you. Uh, did you find that attractive on some lEvel? Disturbing?",Those are my two choices? None of the above. She was just a Patient. She was interesting.,"Irie, sorry. More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael. It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct?"
"You know, she just won a settlement for some families whose housing dEvelopment was built on an old methane field.",Toxic exposure to methane could explain this.,She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
"All right, it's nothing personal. Bet she didn't think you were her type back when you first met either.","We'll take her back to the hospital, test her blood and urine and start treatment.",III didnt! I didnt! She thought you were cute.
Oh! I'm all right.,What happened?,"Okay, oh! All right."
Her pants are wet.,Urinary incontinence. He checks Sidney's eyes. She's having complex partial seizures. This isn't methane. And you can leave the bucket. We need to get her to,So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
voice over Seizures? back in the office This is the second diagnosis you've come up with that has a personal resonance for you.,I'm choosing my diagnoses based on personal issues? You think she fell down the stairs and peed her pants 'cause Wilson dumped her too?,Youre going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we werent on a date.
"You're choosing to tell me about this case, so let's look at it. First you were fixated on a harmful toxin from her past, possibly because you're worried about a harmful toxin from your own past.",Chase had the toxin idea. Maybe he's obsessed with my past.,This was a terrible relationship.
Andand now you're talking about a seizure disorder?,Which is also not a toxin.,Oh You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
But which is most likely caused by an old injury to the brain. Whwhy do you see your past as such a threat?,"Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back.",Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
"Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back.",There's a ding mark.,"No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and"
It's a piece of junk. It was dinged when it came in.,"Sure, thethe cup marks and the scuffs and the paint and those three Parkps. This fourth one's new.","Na, forget it, its probably stripped and sold for parts by now."
That should be it.,You said you pawned five books. There's only four.,"Okay, that should do it."
That's all there is.,Where's Approach to the Acute Abdomen?,"I suppose this is it, then."
Where's Approach to the Acute Abdomen? Sold it.,To?,"Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?"
"I can't tell you. It's a law, and should be. Crazy bastards like you try to hunt down their stuff.",How much for the pile?,"If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked."
How much for the pile? $500.,stunned You said it was junk.,You bid $800.
Why is it so important that you get your stuff back?,Unlike the rest of huManity! Who's okay when their belongings are taken. Everyone wants their stuff. That's why it's their stuff.,I dont understand why you keep your stuff here when theres plenty of room at home.
Everyone doesn't pay five times what it's worth.,I like my stuff. I hate it when Wilson moves it,"Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it."
I hate it when Wilson moves it Oh!,This is not about Wilson!,Hate the twirl!
I wasn't gonna say anything.,"31, 31! Hike!",I wasnt going to tell you.
Hike! First down!,"One more, you get a touchdown.",I love hiking!
"One more, you get a touchdown. Whoo!",Hike!,I got a touchdown!
"Huh! House, holding the ball, goes to open the door. House, you can't run for the touchdown.",And! hike!,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didnt count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking."
"voice over Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Alvie freezes in midair, having just caught the ball. Cut to Nolan's office. You seriously thought you were gonna tell me that Wilson showed up but not tell me what he said?",Because I thought you were a smart guy who didn't need the obvious spelled out to him.,Youre You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today.
"House, House, stop! Stop, stop, stop.",You okay?,Close the windows!
Yeah. It was my mother's. She died when I was four. It's all I have left.,"That's very sad, Alvie. Listen, I set up an immigration hearing.","Oh, thats a nice one."
"Um, interesting. You present yourself as, uh, not giving a damn about other people's emotions, but your actions indiCate otherwise. You dismiss Alvie's story about his mother, but you cared enough to schedule a hearing.",I cared for eight seconds. Then I got distracted.,"Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a lovein? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldnt refute."
I cared for eight seconds. Then I got distracted.,Yeah.,"Oh, wait. I just realized I dont care."
voice over We've kept the Patient up for 12 hours now. No hint of seizure-like activity. We should shut this down.,"Try a stRobe light, add more stress.","Outside, in the cave."
"puts the phone back to his ear Apparently, without her memory, the Patient's personality has returned to what you might call its natural state.",Seems she had a wake-up call while she was at college.,Pennys on the phone with her.
The thing that caused the change is gone! So the change itself is gone.,Yeah. I knew the psychological aspects of this case would interest you. Bet you got a theory already. What is it?,No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
It's not relevant.,deliberately What is it?,Its not about that.
Why do you care about my theory?,"I think he just! bores her. She's at an earlier stage of dEvelopment. She's looking at her grown-up future, and it puts her to sleep.","Uh, its basically a summary of the theory, but theres a bunch of positive comments on the message board."
"If he just bored her, she'd hide it to be polite. Their pRoblem is synchronicity. Just like you and me, House, they're not on the same page. He talks to her like someone he shares history with. But from her point of view, he's a stranger forcing intimacy on her. Of course she doesn't like him. He's not helping. He can feel he's losing his wife, and it makes him come on stronger.",He almost did lose his wife.,I dont know.
And the D.I. came from damage to the hypothalamus.,"pointing to the image on the monitor Hypothalamus here, hence the D.I.","Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? IIII cant. I couldnt even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade."
"voice over. House turns toward the voice Okay, now you're just doing this to mess with me. cut to Nolan's office What possible relevance does this differential have to your pRoblems?",It ends with a diagnosis of spongiform encephalitis. I convinced the team to cut out part of this Woman's brain. That's not interesting to you?,"Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!"
No. He has his hand over his face and he sounds weary.,Not Even if it's the Amygdala? She'll lose all her long-term memory.,Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
"Well, this is where you tell me that being cavalier with someone else's past has nothing to do with avoiding your own past. The case is irrelevant. You just found it, uh! interesting.",rubbing at his scalp with his fingertips as if he's washing his hair Aren't therapists supposed to be nurturing?,Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
"Nowhere! is that in the Manual. Look, youyou've been in therapy for a year. You know when I ask you to talk about anything, I mean anything that affects you what upset you, what made you mad or reliEved or joyful. You want me to beliEve that this case means nothing? Then, um! why should I listen to it?",Are you charging me for this time?,"And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors."
not looking up Yes.,This is ridiculous.,"Or worse, up."
What's that? On the back of your arm?,It's just a bruise. And I fell.,Ohh! What is that on your finger?! Im blind!
You remember falling?,No. I was drunk! Hence the balance issues. He reaches for his jacket.,"Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?"
"Well, it looks like you fell on the tip of someone's boot.",I said something that someone objected to.,"No, youve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe."
"Well, if you don't remember, then how can you","It's usually the way it is when someone hits me. People who kick when you're down are jerks, but they're generally not irrational jerks.",Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
"You got drunk enough to get into a bar fight and not remember, and you've been insisting that Everything's fine? Wwhywhy go out and get blind drunk? Were you looking for a fight?",I don't know.,You know what?
closing the magazine What have you screwed up?,puzzled What?,Thank God you didnt try to fan out the magazines.
"You say that when you've been hit in the past, it's because you provoked it with something that you said, which means you're well aware of the risks. So on some lEvel, you were in that bar looking for someone to hurt you. Logically, people punish themselves for something they did or something they didn't do. So what! did you screw up?","thinks, then shakes his head. speaks quietly I don't know. long pause Okay, there may be a pRoblem.","Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it."
I told him your book was contaminated with Anthrax spores. Then I gave him $300. holds up a slip of paper The address of the buyer. pause Maybe I was hasty in asking you to move out. Why don't you stay with me and Sam for a little while? There's no need to hurry things.,What prompted this?,"Mr. Decker, we didnt lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... whats that? No, we didnt close last time. I just need your... Oh. WWhat code were you given? Oh, OK. Thats actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I dont blame you."
"Look, the whole idea was that after Mayfield, you wouldn't be on your own. I can touch base with you a lot more easily if you're staying with me than","grabbing the address God's sake, Wilson. You really span the chasm from wishy to washy. If you're gonna be an ass, be an ass. Stick with it.","When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, Michael, I love you, but I cant do this."
"Why were you being so hard on the guy, when he was being conciliatory?",Come on. Cuddy played on his guilt. She put him up to this.,"The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was."
How do you know that? How do you know this wasn't entirely his own idea?,"Two reasons first, he wants to create the perfect environment to be with Sam.",I cant... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
Maybe it was Sam.,"voice over Yeah, that's a possibility.",His name is Sam.
"Okay, um! Not Sam. Uh, that still doesn't answer why Cuddy.","Because they've been talking about me. She called me to check on the Patient, which she nEver does without a reason. I asked why, and she said!","Youll get them back, I swear it."
"She's a barracuda attorney, House. These are the kind of Patients we like to keep happy.",Right now the Patient's lucky if she can spell jurisprudence.,You dont take my clients away and give them to a secretary.
"Yeah, but when she gets that memory back, which we are trying to make happen, she'll be able to spell lawsuit. I'm just touParkng base.",TouParkng base. Wilson used exactly the same phrase. Colluding about me is their favorite pastime.,Except you just told me you were gonna make it up.
Wait a minute. Taub's not here.,"Yeah, he is.","Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!"
What's Taub doing in my imaginary version of a scene with Wilson and Cuddy?,"Your version needed to be ended, 'cause it's crap. It's all sweetness and light and! faith that I'm gonna choose the right path. Yeah, that sounds like Wilson.",I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
I have as much evidence for mine as you do for yours. I know Wilson's your friend. So he could be wondering if he did right by you. And I know he wouldn't have asked you to move out in the first place unless he was convinced you could handle life on your own.,And I know that he and Cuddy have gone behind my back before to strategize about the House pRoblem.,Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?
So there's truth in both versions. But you choose to focus on the parts that make you uncomfortable. So! leans forward Why are you and Wilson! friends? Do you think this friendship is the best you can do?,Wilson is not a consolation prize.,"This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take."
"There! You're defending him. And a minute ago, he was skulking around in the background like some sort of Manipulative Iago.",glowering He's my friend.,Who said anything about him?
So what do you value in him?,"thinks I can say whatEver I want to him, and he'll nEver leave.",The way he makes me feel about myself.
"He's sort of leaving. At least, he won't be around as much! because he's putting Sam first.","For now. After the divorce, he'll pRobably ask me to move in again. I take the long view.","Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He wont get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight"
You say that to Wilson?,Are you kidding? That's the kind of remark that leads people to hit you.,Were you guys making fun of Parker?
"Uh, maybe you've been right from the beginning. Maybe this isn't about Wilson.",You say that now that I finally agree with you? Do you just argue the opposite of whatEver I say?,Its not. Lets get Kelly in here to take his place.
"I don't mean the Wilson thing doesn't, uh, bother you, uh, but it sounds like he's the closest you can come to a safe relationship. You'd have to do something major to screw it up. Um, whatwhat else have you been involved in this week? What would you want to punish yourself for?","thinking I told you, I don't know.","Hello. Listen, Ive been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think"
"Okay, um, let's approach it from a different angle. Have you gotten any other people angry at you over anything?","Well, yeah. That's why I called it an ordinary week.",I never said I was angry at you.
Why wouldn't she? Of course she's willing to risk losing her memories perManently. She has no idea how important those memories are. Does she Even know what risk is? She's nEver lost anything.,"Without the surgery, she'll lose Everything. The prion infection will continue to advance and destroy her whole brain.","yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know."
"Well, there has to be another way. Please. I'm speaking for my wife, the wife I lived with for four years who isn't here and can't defend herself. House turns and stares at a monitor. Dr. House, are you listening?","Well, you can stop arguing, 'cause it doesn't matter anymore. Look at the variability in the heart rate. The S.E. has spread into the brain stem.","I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh."
No. We can't cut the brain stem.,This thing's moving too quickly.,"We can, but the part of Penny might get cut."
That was pretty rough Do you always break the news to your Patients that way? Or were you short-handing it for me?,Husband was being an idiot.,Im gonna need that bag back.
"Well, he was asking for it. But, um, to punish him you have to punish the wife too. Whywhy did he make you so angry, Hmm? Because he didn't want to cooperate with you?",He'd rather risk his wife's life than their marriage. People's brains stop working when they think they're gonna lose someone they love.,"Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, and Im making him do my laundry for a year."
Your leg hurt?,It's all right.,"Joey, whatwhwhwhawhwhawhwhawhwhawhat are you doing here?"
Okay. Anyone else you pissed off?,50 bucks for the book.,Are you upset about something?
50 bucks for the book. Forget it.,You paid $25. That's 100% return.,"So, what do you say, Joey?"
"That's what I paid. But it's a rare surgical text, nearly 100 years old plates in mint condition. That book's worth sEveral thousand dollars.","$2,000. I'll write you a check.","While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars."
"Yo, House, you want to stop by the library? 'Cause I got a book to return. Ta-ka-plow! He pulls the book from under his shirt. As House takes it, Alvie raps",Anyone see you?,"Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandlers bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?"
I didn't know there was a section of the brain just for hope.,"It's very, very tiny.","Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain."
We're trying to stabilize her heart. She's still tachy and hypotensive.,"Brain, heart, and rapidly progressing.",Ive been sitting here for days!

My mother's DNA was still on that cross?,It could be.,That wasnt so bad.
You faked it? He jumps on House to hug him. It wasn't just me. You lied to them too!,I'm better at it than you are.,"No, did he hug you?"
May need to tube her. Grab some I.V. furosemide.,"Wait, wait.","Yknow, of all my friends, noone knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
We need to get her on a vent.,There's something on her ankle. He touches her leg,She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Eddie would go. It's a surfing phrase. Must be from her earlier life.,"She tried to get it removed, but they only took off the top layers of skin.","No, Eddie likes to keep it over there."
So you were right! in the end. It was her past. Did she get her memory back?,voice over Not yet.,"Thats right, she came back all by herself."
voice over Not yet. Will she?,No way to know.,Shes going to be screaming her own last name?
"He's treating her as though they just met. He's courting her. Whose idea was that? House walks off, quickly. He was doing the opposite of Everything he should. Suddenly he's changed.",Taub thought it might,"Hes like that in the beginning, so she can change him."
"following House down the hall That was your idea. And you asked me what I thought was going on between them. It's their relationship that's on your mind. That's why you've been thinking about this case relationships. Lost one with Wilson, gained one with Alvie.",Not exactly.,"So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us."
"Lost one with Wilson, gained one with Alvie. Not exactly.",Alvie?,which is why they need a passing game.
voice over You gonna tell me what the note said?,putting the note down Alvie was very grateful that I'd gotten him out of trouble.,Do you happen to know what Im going to say?
You didn't think he was gonna stay forEver.,No.,I was kinda hoping youd stay.
What happened next?,voice over Nothing happened next.,So what happens next?
voice over Nothing happened next.,That's all I got.,"Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up."
"thinking, sighs Relationships.",BergMan. shrugs What do you want me to say?,Hey! Yknow what? Lets talk about relationships!
I don't know. You're the one who set the theme something about relationships made you go out and provoke a fight. Wilson and Sam have a relationship. You're not thrilled about it.,"They're happy. Why should I screw that up? Everyone's happy. Everyone's moving in together Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and Lucas. Even Alvie's","Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous."
Cuddy and Lucas are moving in together? You didn't mention that.,They talked about moving in together before. It's not big news.,"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in."

Like her! Housewarming?,It's just a gift.,Do you like living with her?
"A Woman you care about is taking one step further away from you and closer to someone else? II think I can safely say yes, it's significant if you don't mention it.

to Hanna Please listen to me. You've been down here almost two hours. By the time they clear away the rubble,Interrupting We are not cutting off her leg. to Hanna You don't have to rush through this to make his job easier. He motions toward the captain,"No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out.

Just promise me you won't let them cut off my leg.,crossing his fingers I promise. Does that make you feel better?,I know. I wont let them. Ill cut off their faces. I will.
Your phone is working down here.,flipping open his phone Switched carriers. Better rollover minutes. into the phone Talk.,"Hey, you know our phones not working?"
"talking to House on the phone from the diagnostics conference room MRI was clean, but afterwards, he started bleeding out of his eyes and nose.",So there was something wrong before the collapse.,"You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork."

entering the conference room Sorry I'm late.,to Thirteen Where were you?,Lets go to the conference room.
"The infection causes neurological symptoms, goes systemic, and D.I.C. causes the bleed.",Good theory. Except for the part that there's no fEver. Get an X-ray venogram. See if you can find a reason for your existence. Also look for venous sinus thrombosis.,"No, not since I lost her at the airport."
Would have seen it on the MRI.,Not if you were too busy not looking for it.,It was there when I sat down.
We should X-ray for a facial fracture first. This could all be simple trauma.,Just do what I tell you. Be back in ten minutes. He disconnects the call,"Look, I dont wanna make any trouble, okay, but Im in a lot of pain here, alright?"
He disconnects the call You're leaving?,There's a dozen people here who can save you. I'm apparently the only one who can save this other guy.,"Im sorry. Hes asked me to hold all calls unless youre Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future."

She wants you.,I'm flattered. Give her oxygen. He starts up the bike engine,I think she likes you.
You only came back because I freaked out. Right?,Not at all. I just realized how... big and scary the world is and how cozy and safe this little place is. He takes off his leather jacket,"No, nono, nono, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you."
Thank you. I'm sorry I needed you.,Here. Call your husband.,Youre welcome. Im sorry. Did I hurt you?

"Okay. to Charlie Okay, they're telling me I have to go.",That was stupid of me.,Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
It was nice.,I don't see that as a contradiction.,You seem tense.
"He was already on his way. He was in Baltimore, and they all saw it on the news. How Many people were hurt?",What did I tell you about not raising your blood pressure?,How many men did we lose?
Can I ask what's wrong with your leg?,Crane fell on it. Hanna laughs Small world.,I just cant figure out what happened.
smiling You could have just said no.,I'll remember that for my next huMan contact.,"Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody."
Would you pray with me?,No. I'm not in the habit of encouraging my Patients' superstitions.,And I will pray for you.
How is that a habit? You plan on getting trapped under a building again?,I don't beliEve in God.,"Oh, my God."
"I always thought... If I did the right thing, if I treated people right, then good things would happen to me. You think that's how it works?",I didn't use to. Then recently I tried... Now I don't know.,Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
to House You think we can be friends when I get outta here?,Yeah. We'll catch a ball game or... group sex show or something.,"Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?"

I'm feeling the pain already.,That's good. That means the pressure's coming off. Much closer to getting out of here.,"Yeah, okay. Well this is gonna hurt like a mother."
Much closer to getting out of here. Aah!,Come on. Pull her out.,"No, I wanna stay here."
Come on. Pull her out.,Come on!,"Mission accomplished, boys."

You know who's Even luckier? You and just about Every other huMan being His cell phone rings who wasn't down there.,answering the phone What did the venogram say?,"So, why was it his lucky day?"
He didn't say his neck was sore.,That's 'cause Everything's sore. He just took a 15-story swan dive into concrete. Do an LP.,Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing XBox?
We also have to consider other infections.,So you're suggesting we do an LP.,Looks like hes doing pretty good.
I guess I am.,Genius.,I bet you are.
Then we have to amputate.,No.,Ill chop off one hand.
It's been four hours already. It used to be a long shot. Now it's...crazy.,Crush syndrome is basically a buildup of potassium. If we remove potassium,We seem to be running short of patience here.
We're already treating with sodium bicarbonate.,But not with glucose and Insulin. We have glucose in the kit. There's gotta be a diabetic here somewhere.,"Hey, we could liberate some microporous charcoal from the chem lab."
You wanna dose the insulin here in a non-hospital setting? That is insane! It's not worth it.,still rubbing his leg Really?,Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?
"I know you're angry, but please don't put her life at risk just to get back at me.",Really? standing up and towering over her Wow. So this is all about you now.,"Well, I know shes mad at me about something."
You took her side against me right after you heard about my engagement.,Yeah. That must be it. It's not that you're a pathetic narcissist.,"So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend."
I don't love you. So just... accept it and move on with your life instead of making Everyone miserable.,That's great. A life lesson from a middle-age single mom who's dating a Man-Parkld.,"Yeah, what are they gonna say you didnt love me anymore."
Screw you. I'm sick of making excuses for you. I'm sick of other people having to tiptoe around you and make their own lives worse while they try to keep you from collapsing. I'm done. She walks away from him,calling after her Fantastic. Just stay away from my Patient.,"Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault."
seeing him Dr. House. Tell her.,"Hanna... We have to amputate your leg. Cuddy looks up at him, surprised",Do we have to tell her?
No. You said... that there was time.,There was. And it's run out.,"No, no. I still have time."
And it's run out. No.,You asked me how I'd hurt my leg.,Afraid theres not much left.
shivering But you saved your leg.,I wish I hadn't.,"You mean the night that I went iceskating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?"
I wish I hadn't.,"They cut out a chunk of muscle about the size of my fist, and they left me with this, mutilated, useless thing.",She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
after a lengthy pause Okay.,"I got it. He picks up the amputation kit, taking responsibility for the amputation upon himself","Uh, Im sorry, can we just pause for a minute?"
"I got it. He picks up the amputation kit, taking responsibility for the amputation upon himself",I can't put you out. It could depress your respiration too much. This should take away some of the pain. He pushes a drug into her IV,"I have a relationship and a fulltime career, too."
Will it be quick?,"I'll use a scalpel to slice through the skin, muscle, and fat.",How much time do you think youll need?
How bad will it hurt?,Like nothing you've Ever felt before.,"Michael, it has nothing"
I love you.,into the phone What?,Yeah. I think Im gonna take her to miniature golf.
"He's fallen into a coma. LP was clean, but...",What are his vitals?,"Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya."
"Excuse me, Officer.","What do you mean, Officer? How long has there been a cop there?","Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,."
I don't know. Ten minutes. He was being questioned when he fell into the coma.,Was anything else making him nervous or worried before his other symptoms?,"Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer."
He was claustrophobic right before the bleed and before the fEver. We told him that he pRobably did fall asleep.,Was his BP spiking?,Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
But that didn't cause his first symptom.,"Yeah, it did.",Which he only did once.
An arachnoid cyst on his lower spine. That's why we missed it. He's been sitting ten hours a day. Spiked his spinal fluid pressure.,Run a CT,"Before we go, Id like to remind everyone that the Halberts have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service."
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.,Breath sounds bilaterally.,I owe you my life.
What's happening. What's going on?,Her body won't get any oxygen unless we can bust the clot. This is a blood thinner.,"Well, what are you thinking of naming it?"
Is she gonna be all right?,It's gonna make her bleed more. We'll take care of that next.,"Well, it is, all right?"
It's gonna make her bleed more. We'll take care of that next.,It's not busting the clot.,Her shirt is touching them.
Maybe it's her heart. What?,It's not a clot. It's a fat embolism. From the amputation.,I think she has a good heart.
You can't blame yourself for her death. This wasn't your fault.,turning toward Foreman and shouting That's the point! I did Everything right. She died anyway. Why the hell do you think that would make me feel any better?,"Me? Its my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat."
You shouldn't be alone right now. You're bleeding.,standing up and sounding menacing I'm gonna give you a task as an employee. Get out of my way.,"Im fine. No, Im not alone... I dont know, some guy."
Are you okay? Obviously not.,inhaling You going to leap across the room and grab them out of my hand?,"I went to save them, I failed."
No. It's your choice if you want to go back on drugs.,"Okay. Just so you know, I'm finding it hard to see the downside.","Fine. Im not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didnt you ask me before you did it?"
You need to re-bandage your shoulder.,Is that why you're here? Foreman sent you?,"I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."
Foreman sent you? No.,You here to yell at me again?,Did Benjen send you?
You here to yell at me again? No.,"Well, I'm running out of ideas.",Dont yell at me!
"Well, I'm running out of ideas. Lucas...","Oh, great. You're feeling uncomfortable again. PRobably means you just got back from some quickie wedding in Vegas or you're already pregnant.","If we dont start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again."
I ended it.,shocked What?,You can end this.
"I'm stuck, House. sighing deeply I keep wanting to move forward. I keep wanting to move on, and I can't. I mean, my new House, with my new fianc, and all I can think about is you. exhaling I just need to know if you and I can work.",You think I can fix myself?,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, theres no way for me to tell you this. At least theres no new way for me to tell you this. I just dont things are gonna work out."
I don't know.,'Cause I'm the most screwed-up person in the world.,Any good weekend plans?
I know. I love you. pause I wish I didn't. But I can't help it.,How do I know I'm not hallucinating?,"Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right."
Did you take the Vicodin?,Nope.,"Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?"
smiling sweetly Then I think we're okay.,"also smiling sweetly, yes, sweetly Yeah.","Oh, right, Im sorry."
"also smiling sweetly, yes, sweetly Yeah.",Damn it. I waited too long.,"In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?"
voice over It's your choice if you wanna go back on drugs.,You think I can fix myself?,"Ok, Ive heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that."
softly Let me see. She peels the bandage off the wound on his neck. It's okay. He pulls his head away. She inhales sharply. It's gonna get infected.,"Hey, you're not gonna...","He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace."
It's okay. I love you.,So now what?,Its all right.
curling back onto her side Everything's good. We don't have to talk through it all.,"No, I meant it literally. Now what? We could make breakfast. We could go bowling. He lifts the sheet, checks and drops it back in place. We could stay here.","So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred."
I have to go home and get dressed and go to work.,So that's it?,"You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair."
I'm hoping this is the beginning of it.,very quietly Yeah.,"Oh, no, no, no."
Hello? Dr. Cuddy?,"No, this is Dr. Cuddy's nanny. She's, uh, feeling a little under the weather now, so she won't be coming in today.",Thats really not cool.
Oh. I hope she's all right. Would you mind asking her if,No. Can't do that. I'm afraid she's locked in the bathroom. Terrible bug going around. What's the pRoblem?,"Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it."
"Well, I'm sorry to disturb her, but it's Dr. Richardson. He must have the same stomach flu. He threw up in the O.R., and I'm not sure how she'd want me to",Hold on a second.,"So, were all agreed?"
There's glass Everywhere. Couldn't you have just put the mirror down nice and gentle?,I was in a mood.,"Oh, come on, it wasnt me."
I'll be right back.,Don't get that.,How are you?
It could be important.,This is important.,Its very important.
Okay. I'll go turn it off.,"Thank you. She leaves. When she comes back, she sits on the edge of the tub. Her hands are empty. You're distracted.","Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isnt that nice? Thank you very much."
You're distracted. I'm not.,"Yeah, you are.",Huh huh huh.
I'm sorry. The clinic is facing reduced funding from the state. Nurse Jeffrey is filing his 12th H.R. complaint. Richardson is threatening to quit because he's basically been a prisoner at the hospital for almost a week.,Richardson?,"Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now theres not enough for both me and Pam to stay on."
"The neurosurgeon. He's the only one I have right now, which means he has to stay on the premises at all times, or else the hospital technically isn't a lEvel one trauma center.",Which means?,"well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my In case of emergency person?"
"I'd have to shut down the E.R., transfer all of the Patients out of the ICU...","gets up Okay, stop. Turn around.",I would make sure that you were dead.
Turn around. Why?,Because you need to relax.,Turn around and go.
Where are we going?,I am going to make you a magical bath.,That is not true.
I must have solitude to focus my creative energies. Hello?,"Interesting factoid. Did you know that if we don't have a neurosurgeon on the premises, all the puppies in the world will choke to death on all the babies?",Its kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
Yeah. You got a note from Thirteen.,"So how come we don't have, like, five neurosurgeons?",So I got it when I was 13.
"Well, we had three, but Kapur retired, and then Nichols just took off for his daughter's wedding.","I've got good news. For the next 16 hours, you are the new neurosurgeon.",I dont wanna hear Three failed marriages!
scoffing I'm not a neurosurgeon.,Which would matter if you actually had to do some neurosurgery.,"Well, youre an excellent neuroscientist, youre a wonderful girlfriend, and"
"House, it's a hospital. The odds of having to do neurosurgery are higher than in most places.","If an EMT calls in with a brain or spinal trauma, just divert them to the nearest hospital.",Have you ever heard the phrase Rich as a Lannister?

"Oh. Well, that makes it all right then.","So what, exactly, is this? It can still be open and casual and fun if you want.","Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
Open? She looks up at him. You think I want to see other people?,"Well, last night was emotional for you.",Lets open her up.
Which I don't regret.,I'm not saying you do. I'm just saying it was an impulsive move.,Great. Not like regret at all.
Don't do this. Why do you have to analyze things to death? Why can't you just... let it be nice?,deep breath You're right. He squeezes his eyes shut. That was very anti-secret bath.,"Okay, well, thats just ridiculous, so just dont, II dont have time for this right now."
That was very anti-secret bath. House.,Yeah.,"Honey, its not the bath I enjoy, its the wet, naked lady."
The secret bath is... burning my lady parts.,How do you think my whispers anus feels? Burning means it's working.,"Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat."
Can we get out now?,I was so waiting for you to say that.,"Alright, I can get you out."
I'm... not a neurosurgeon?,"And...voila! For the first course, I flaked some tender young ears of corn on the side of assorted exotic breakfast meats in a Parkli sauce reduction.","If I want excuses, Ill put her in charge."
And the... second course?,"sitting A single grape. To cleanse the palate. Which is kind of a waste, 'cause there is no third course.","Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, doublefist it, and head through this obstacle course."
I'm glad we stayed in. This is actually... pretty good.,I can always tell when you lie. I mean always.,Glad you guys could make it.
I slept with my freshMan roommate.,A lie.,Remember back in freshman year?
A lie. A truth.,You have a tell.,"That is a lie, that is a lie."
What is it?,First admit that you were lying.,It wasnt safe for her inside.
Fine. I was lying. My sexual history is boring and predictable. What is my tell?,"Are you kidding? If I tell you your tell, you'll get rid of it, then I won't be able to tell.","Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted."
"Well, then you have to tell me something I don't already know about you.","Even though, technically, you didn't tell me something that I didn't already know about you.","Okay, I think thats enough about me."
Quit being so damn logical and just tell me.,"I used to have an intimate relationship with a photograph of you. Well, actually, a sock and a photograph.","Oh, oh, please, if I dont know, you dont know."
"Well, actually, a sock and a photograph. I know.",I was lying.,I dont know.
The photo you took of me as Sleeping Beauty on Halloween. Why else would you take that picture?,"I have to pee. He gets up, holding his leg, and starts for the bathroom. Ha! You can't tell. 'Cause actually, I have to poo.","Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid."
"I have to pee. He gets up, holding his leg, and starts for the bathroom. Ha! You can't tell. 'Cause actually, I have to poo.",whispers What?,"Oh, I have to go pee."
Cuddy's assistant decided to use his own brain. Who put that idiot idea into his head?,Perhaps you could follow the same advice.,"OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or Im gonna lose MY FRICKIN MIND!"
"He notified DPH that there's no neurosurgeon on the premises. Said he legally had to, which he legally had to.",Sounds like you got the situation under control.,What choice did the university have?
"No. I don't. You know I don't. When DPH shows up, they're gonna shut down our E.R. This can't be fixed. It is what it is, House.",Great. I've got Every faith in your ability to solve the pRoblem.,"I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry."
Can I open them yet?,Just a second. A few heavy steps are heard. Okay. Hold out your hand.,"Hey, can you open this for me?"
Hold out your hand. Oh...,produces a bottle of champagne from behind his back I always wanted to open a bottle of champagne with one of these things.,"Hey! Oh my God youre here, let me see your hand!!"
produces a bottle of champagne from behind his back I always wanted to open a bottle of champagne with one of these things. You might wanna stand behind me for this.,Okay...,This bottle opener.
quietly Just let him in.,No.,Dont let him in!
pounding again House!,"If we just ignore him, he'll go away.","Once again, and action!"
more pounding House!,whispering I think he finally left.,Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God Come and knock on my door
Just let him in.,No!,Dont send him away.
House. You can't just not show up to work. What's Cuddy gonna say?,If this is still Wilson...,What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
Why didn't you let him in?,You were thinking about Wilson while we were having sex? That's so cool! So was I.,"No, youre the one who let him in."
You were hiding me from him. Why?,I was not hiding you. I was protecting your privacy. Wasn't sure if you were ready to go public with the whole... us thing yet.,"Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?"
What are you doing?,You think I'm afraid to go public? I'm gonna prove you wrong.,"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?"
You think I'm afraid to go public? I'm gonna prove you wrong.,"With a sex tape. We'll send it to Wilson. It's a win-win. We get to do it again, and... he might actually learn something.","Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information?"
whispers It sounds like someone's trying to break in. Hey.,Stuck? Bummer. Looks painful. He lowers the sword then uses it to scoop the tea kettle from the stove. Chamomile or English breakfast?,Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
Would you stop being an ass and pull me out of here?,fills the kettle You didn't get my message earlier?,"Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?"
"Yeah. But as someone once told me, Everybody lies.","puts the kettle on the stove I'm fine. Just staying home, Parkll-laxin'.",But now we think youre a liar.
"Your Patient died, you ignore my calls, and you won't open the door. I don't think you're fine. I think you might be throwing away a drug-free year.",Or... I'm ignoring you for a different reason. confidentially Sex with my girlfriend.,"Oh, youre inviting me over to eat?"
"Hmm. pushes at the window again Will you please just please let me in? House slides the window up then wheels the trolley and Wilson into the kitchen. After a moment, Wilson lowers his feet from the window sill and stands. Thank you. And since when did you start referring to hookers as girlfriends?",She's not a hooker.,"Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldnt hear you. Im welding this locomotive engine. And if you didnt knock, how about some manners?"
looking around What are wha really?,"Begins with C, ends with uddy.",Whats out there?
huge sigh How Many Vicodin have you taken?,I'm serious. Cuddy and I are now Cuddy and I. There's an I in Cuddy.,How many drinks have you had tonight?
House... it's okay. Almost all addicts relapse a few times.,gesturing for Wilson to follow him She's in my bedroom.,I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
"You're hallucinating, House.",calling as they walk down the hall Honey buns! We got company.,"Howie, this is just your hypochondria."
Pupils are normal. Pulse is normal.,Better than that. They're both totally awesome. I'm not on drugs.,"Hey, oh, you know that guy whos been following me?"
So... why did you lie about Cuddy?,To make a point. PRobably something to do with shutting you up. It's my go-to idea.,I lied about some aspects of the building.
"You do seem okay. You want me to stick around? I could do my usual thing of pretending I like watParkng monster truck rallies, if that would make you feel better.",No. You go.,"No, Im fine."
House... you could have died. You had a Patient who did die in your arms. You shouldn't be alone.,"I know. That's why I called a hooker. hops down and escorts Wilson to the living room Now, go away. 'Cause... you'll be extra.","Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes."
Are you really okay?,Are you gonna break in again? You checked my pulse. You checked my pupils. I'll mail you the urine sample.,"I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day Im receptionist again."
No. I approve. Living fast and dying young is crap. If you have a chance to get better... I say good for you.,"I brought Wilson in here specifically to go public, just like you requested.","No, itsAh, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin alive, stayin alive."
"I pressured you. Wilson coming through the window pressured you. If you're forced into this, it's not gonna work. long pause Do you have any response to that?",Game on.,What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?
Design for five points.,Got it.,Coming in point three five.
Got it. Hear.,Got it. Both versions.,I got it.
Love. pause. He looks up. You didn't see love.,Wow. I didn't think you'd take my lack of board game skills so personally.,"Yeah, love. Its a tricky business isnt it?"
Why didn't you tell me you loved me?,"Didn't a wise Woman once say and by once, I mean two hours ago why do you have to analyze Everything to death? Why can't this just be nice?",Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
puts down her pad I told you I loved you. You didn't tell me you loved me back. You don't think that should give me cause for concern?,No. 'Cause words don't matter. Actions matter.,"All right. And she wont say, I love you."
You're really gonna take a stand here. You can't say,Nope.,"Well, Im going to stand here until you change your mind."
Nope. Why?,Because... I forgot to grab a v.,No. No problem. Why?
"Um... France. And not Paris or the Rivera, but there's this place in NorMandy. It's on a... a tidal island. Everyone who's not staying in one of the small inns has to leave before the tide comes in. You have this 900-year-old fortress all to yourself. It's called...",Mont Saint-Michel?,A place where no one will ever get out alive?
That's it. Have you been there?,Nope.,Have you been to Ashemark?
Hhow did you know?,You used to have a picture of it as a screensaver.,"Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour."
That was years ago.,"I guess it's a memorable place. turns the computer toward himself again Now, unfortunately, we can't fly straight to NorMandy, but the layover in London's only a couple of hours.","Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy."
What are you talking about?,It's all there.,"We all make mistakes, lets move on."
I used Wilson's credit card. I can't.,I'm kidding. I used your credit card.,"Uh, credit card."
I used your credit card. House...,The hospital does not need your body. I do.,You gave me a bill at the end of every month.
So does my daughter.,"Well, she can come too. Or to grandmother's House she can go.","Well, so do a lot of people."
This is crazy.,"His face starts to get the closed, guarded look it usually has. So...you break off your engagement, but you won't adjust your schedule.",Im the CEOs son.
"I can't. Not... tomorrow. But... two weekends from now. If Rachel's gonna stay with my mom, I'm gonna need a little bit of prep time.",His face softens and he smiles slightly. Okay.,"I cant. I cant believe I have plans, I cant. Can you do it tomorrow night though?"
Thank you. For Everything.,You're welcome. For Everything.,"Okay, well, thank you guys for everything."
I'll see you tomorrow. She goes to the door. He hasn't moved. His head hangs a bit. I really do have to leave.,"nods, quietly I know.","Okay. Okay, daddy well see you tomorrow night. Okay byebye."
What's the pRoblem?,This isn't gonna work.,Whats the matter?
That's it? You can't just... say that and shut up.,It's just a statement of fact. It's not a Debatable proposition.,You cant tell me to shut up!
Right. Because you can see the future.,No.,Difficult to see.
The only time you're afraid is when you're happy. You just don't expect it to last.,'Cause it doesn't.,Do you know what frightens me?
You don't know that.,I've done horrible things to you.,We dont know that.
"I don't want you to change. I know you're screwed up. I know you are always gonna be screwed up. But you're the most incredible Man I've Ever known. near tears You are always gonna be... the most incredible Man I have Ever known. So unless you're breaking up with me, I am going home now.","quietly, sincerely I love you.",Ive made some big changes in my life and.
smiling It's gonna be great.,almost inaudible Yeah.,It is going to be the happiest day of my life.
That wasn't what I meant. He turns around and sees his sister on the floor. Della? You okay? Mom! Dad!,We got to stop Parking like this. People are gonna talk.,"Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice."
"Well, that's why I plan on doing some talking first. She pats his arm. I want us to formally report our relationship to HuMan Resources.","Okay. You get them, I'll cover Everybody else. He pushes the elevator button with the tip of his cane.",I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.
I would appreciate it if we could keep it quiet until we had that meeting.,It's gonna be hard with me grabbing your ass all day.,"Thats quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped."
"Grabbing stops at the threshold... House grabs her ass, firmly she jumps a little... of the Parking garage.",Handicapped plates. I got special access. She smiles and frees herself they enter the elevator.,"Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck."
You haven't seen it yet.,I sense something fascinating about it.,I havent seen it.
Mom... Seriously Fine. People are gonna know soon enough. I think I can hold it till lunch. He almost smiles. Cuddy smiles back and goes to her office. House watch her going and looks quite happy.,I'm seeing Cuddy.,"Fine, Mom. How are you?"
I'm gonna check my office for whoopee cushions.,This is not a prank.,Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you.
Really? You and Cuddy?,"For realz. Foreman can translate. So Junior Miss Everything skateboarder, basketballer, science clubber, seal clubber Pauses. I'm actually guessing with that last one. Healthy one day, heart arrhythmia the next.","Chandler and Joeys, Chandler is sitting in the canoe as Joey runs through the door carrying an outdoor patio table."
"EKG, echo and head CT are all spotless. There's nothing on her neurological exam.","Interesting. He points his cane at Foreman, then Taub, then Chase In favor, indignant, indifferent. Think I'd like a female perspective. Or Thirteen's. Where is she?",Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional.
"Three years, you've been trying to game out Thirteen. Now you don't care?","Sorry. Not caring about Thirteen is not part of the differential for heart arrhythmia, but you do get a home version of the game.","And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless."
"Patient's brother has sEvere, congenital muscular dystrophy. Life expectancy of about 25. If she's had a latent case of it...",Wouldn't be sudden onset. Foreman!,I dont know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
Do you know something about Thirteen that we don't?,She's entitled to her privacy. Just as I'm entitled to a diagnosis.,Why dont you tell me something I dont know!
And you're glossing over Thirteen's departure because you actually respect somebody's privacy?,I agree.,So youre actually okay with invading your friends privacy?
"If it's Long QT Syndrome, any startling stimulus in that skate Park could have triggered the arrhythmia. Loud noise, flashing lights.",Scare the Patient to death to confirm Long QT.,"I know this isnt my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?"
"Right. The guy who ordered us to stop the Patient's heart has mellowed out. It's gonna be horrible because it's doomed, which is just gonna make House 50 times more of a crank. Has an epiphany. Firecrackers! We can hide 'em under one of those covered food trays. Taub leaves hastily. Foreman looks worried.",Find any itParkng powder in your hanky? Any fake poo in your desk drawer?,"Im afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene."
"You told Everybody, didn't you?",Repeatedly. This one's not buying it. Need a little help.,What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didnt tell me?!!
"House, you've been to HuMan Resources 74 times in the last six weeks.","NEver after doing this. He bends down to kiss Cuddy, who stops him.",Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.
It's a sexual relationship.,Go slowly now. He's writing it down.,"Its a physical relationship, too."
"Uh, we'll also need to watch for any favoritism toward Dr. House. House takes out a pen, hands it to Cuddy she signs the file.",Does that mean she has to sleep with Everyone?,"Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official."
I promise not to give him a raise or a promotion of any kind.,There's got to be a joke there about keeping up with inflation.,Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Or bias against him. Are there any supervisory issues with Dr. House's current case load?,"No, her case is solved. Patient has Long QT. Gonna scare her into cardiac arrest to confirm it.",Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something hes done?
"No, we're not.","Okay, no, we're not. He pockets the pen. See? Everything's under control. He smiles.",No! I am not a pervert! Okay? Its just I just Kinda
I know you're still planning your ridiculous scare test. The Patient is nowhere near sick enough to justify the risk. An angiogram and an E.P. study are much safer and very effective.,Fair point.,That is.
"I'd invite you to watch me not doing the test, but having not done it Many times before, trust me, it's pretty not interesting. House?",Scare test was not approved. Do an angio and E.P. study instead.,Ok. Ok. Ahaha! That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
"House, I was expecting your relationship with Cuddy to compliCate our work long-term. House turns back, gives him a Patient, fake-polite look. I am now concerned it might be affecting us short-term. All due respect.","None taken. I listen to Cuddy all the time. She's my boss. Also yours, by the way.","Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if youre uncomfortable with the way things are going, youre allowed to say something."
"You'd listen, then tell her she's being an idiot, and do whatEver you want.","I find I can skip the idiot part when she's not being an idiot, and since the scare test would have led to the same dead end, she was right to stop it.","Great, then well get married, I wont be able to talk to her, and well spend the rest of our lives in total silence."
This should be interesting.,Losers love company.,"Well, this could be fun."
What about protein deposits? They wouldn't show in her parents' history.,Amyloidosis. Explains both the symptoms. Marrow transplant to treat. Brother's a match. Gives Taub the file Confirm and do.,"Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products."
"I been experiencing fatigue, and and weakness.",Wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that you're... 102 years old.,Cause the sweats getting in my eyes and its burning.
Usually he's strong as an ox.,102-year-old ox.,Come. Hes very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
He has tingling in his feet and his legs. I want a full battery of tests.,Carbon dating?,"Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place."
I'll pay cash if it's not covered.,That's nice of you to float your friend.,"If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that."
Do the tests. I'm sick.,You have a bad case of natural causes.,I cant go in today.
Do the damn tests.,"If the vial fills with sand, we take that as a bad sign.",How else are you gonna study for the tests?
Small pRoblem with the treatment.,Patient won't take marrow from steel wheels?,Is there some problem?
We're finding another match. And how do you know?,What other pRoblem could there be with a pRoblem-free procedure?,"Yknow, we havent found anybody else."
She loves her brother. She's thinking selflessly. How is that at all,Being moronic? Mm. If I can only think of a harm-free medical treatment she turned down lately.,"Its in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby."
"You're right. If Everyone were more selfish, the world would be a better place.",See?,Thats because all people are selfish.
"See? I can skip the idiot part when you're not being an idiot. He turns to leave the Clinic. Wilson is leaning in the doorframe, arms crossed, with a huge smile on his face.","Yeah, I had that same facial expression for the first 48 hours.","Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital?"
I'm happy for you. You're happy for you. This is huge. So who's gonna supervise you?,Cuddy.,I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that Im supposed to have.
"Well, I guess maybe that can work.",Maybe? Nothing's changed.,I suppose that works.
"House, Everything's changed. You're sleeping together. You want something from her besides a sign-off on scaring your Patient to death.",You talked to Taub.,"Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?"
He's worried about you.,He's a jerk.,He feels responsible for you.
I'm worried too.,Do I need to say it?,"Im scared, too."
I want this to work.,I'm not doing anything differently.,Lets give it a shot.
"It's not Amyloidosis. Chase, Taub and a nurse take Della's bed to the OR. Taub is giving her oxygen. She gasps.",She's bleeding to death. Out of her lung. I want to fill a quarter of it with foam.,A bowl full of MMs with a few Ambien tossed in.
"That'd stop the bleeding, all right.",Thought it made more sense than diet and exercise.,"Ok, well, not a problem."
"Scalpel, rib spreader. House is thinking hard.",I can't handle it.,Shh. Lets not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! Im gonna dig it out of the trash!
"It's not completely bad, House. You care enough to pull your punches. That's not a bad thing. But you and Cuddy have got to figure out a way of avoiding this pRoblem. Set some ground rules.",Yeah Wilson looks genuinely surprised. I have to avoid this pRoblem. If I can restrict our interactions to places where neither of us are wearing pants...,"Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong."
"Yeah, that's not avoiding the pRoblem, that's avoiding the issue.","Since avoidance is my plan for dealing with the issue, technically, that's not avoiding it. He seems reliEved. Thanks.",Oh yeah. But doesnt that fix the problem youve been having?
This time. No guarantee bowing to Cuddy will work next time. House gives him a look.,"Heart arrhythmia, kidney failure, and now bleeding lung.",Maybe this time hes going to do it.
"I don't want to criticize your girlfriend, but","Hey, you've been on me for years to respect someone's opinion He starts packing.",You need to get something for your girlfriend.
"What about Goodpasture's? Affects the lungs, kidneys.","And autoimmune explains the out of the blue arrhythmia. Goodpasture's it is. Immunosuppressants and plasmapheresis to treat, kidney biopsy to confirm. He takes his backpack and leaves.","Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!"
He takes his backpack and leaves. Dr. House.,"Don't tell me, your father's hairline is receding, and he needs more tests.",The hallway. Sheldon exits carrying the Apple 2.
"He's 102. His next test is an autopsy. Look, I love the old Man, but I got to get him out of the damn House. He can't do anything without me. He needs to be in a care facility.","Well, so tell him. He's a big boy now.","Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager."
I can't. I'm his whole life. But if it comes from a doctor... He holds out his wallet and slips House a twenty.,That's very generous. When you were 30.,"Oh, true, but think of how much youve accomplished."
I didn't run into you all afternoon. I missed you.,Busy day.,"Oh, I missed you too."
Maybe we should plan on lunch tomorrow.,"PRoblem is, at lunch you tend to wear tops.Cuddy smiles widely.",Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
"PRoblem is, at lunch you tend to wear tops.Cuddy smiles widely. He lifts the sheet and takes a look. This is much better. Cuddy laughs. He smiles and kisses her forehead, then lifts himself and prepares to kiss her properly. The phone rings. Cuddy frowns. He reaches for his phone and answers. During the whole conversation, Cuddy caresses his forearm and traces one of his veins.",Cuddy and I are naked. So I'm having trouble focusing. Use small words.,"Joannas office, Chandler, still handcuffed to the chair, is looking through the lingerie catalogue by turning the pages with his teeth."
"Kidney biopsy was clean, so we rechecked the piece of her lung from the O.R.","You lost me. Sorry, who is this calling again?","No. A common saying, but not their official motto."
Taub's gone to the transplant committee. They may have found a donor lung.,"So this call is purely expositional. He shuts his cell phone and throws it away, then goes back to kissing Cuddy.",It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax.
I should really get dressed. I told the nanny I'd be home by 9 00.,"And I slipped the nanny 40 bucks, told her to stay till 10 00.","Well, you know, Id feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now."
We know we're right about LAM. Tests confirmed it.,That leaves us with two options. Body's rejecting the new lung or we should have rejected the new lung because it's infected.,"Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?"
"If we give steroids for rejection, it'd make an infection worse. If we give antibiotics for infection, it'd make rejection worse.",Which worse is worse?,No We dont have
"If we treat for infection and we're wrong, she'll be dead within hours.",And if we treat for rejection and we're wrong?,"Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain."
"You're assuming her rejection's hyperacute. Odds are, it isn't.",Gotta head off the worst worse first.,It doesnt matter.
"Gotta head off the worst worse first. I studied under Dr. Seuss. Start with IV methylprednisolone for hyperacute rejection. If that fails, we'll switch her to broad-spectrum antibiotics and hope we're not too late. They all get up and leave, except Taub who does not move and looks at his nails.",Cat got your legs?,Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
"We just decided to give meds that could kill the Patient based on a guess. You need approval from Cuddy, and she'll want to take the safer course, and you're gonna fold like an origami crane, so... He takes the file. I'll just wait here till we get our actual orders.",Fine.,"Um, I am a little busy."
You want me to get Cuddy's approval?,I gotta be somewhere important.,You know what?
Sitting at your desk?,I'm running late. He turns back to his office. Taub gets up and goes to see Cuddy.,"No, I work at a desk all day, its nice working with my hands."
"I can't do anything without him helping me like I'm senile. If I go back there, I'm gonna rip his throat out.",You sure you won't warm up to him over time?,"Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat."
Skip the blood work. House suppress a smile. Tell my son it's grim news. I need to be in a nursing home. A private room. Pause Make it a suite.,"Be our little secret. He pockets the note. Maurice goes to leave, but is stuck by a Very Angry Cuddy briskly entering House's office. Taub follows.","If I have to Ill, Ill do all again , Ill do the 4 oclock feeding thing, Ill go to the P."
I needed to be aggressive.,You're an idiot.,"I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?"
The odds are against it being hyperacute rejection.,Stop.,"Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on."
"The new lung's ruined, and it's not rejection or infection. The only two options were wrong.",Unless it's not LAM.,"So, these are for you, and if youre not too mad, wed love to take you guys to dinner."
It is LAM. The tests were positive.,Then the tests have to be wrong.,You want to know what side my family fights on?
Deep-fryer's working again. Pointing at the salad Still working on that?,"No, it was here when I sat down. I need to think. He gets up and leaves. Wilson stills, fork in hand.","Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? Cause that guy couldnt get sick, just like me."
I want to make sure you're trying Everything to save my sister.,"Everything? Well, that must be it. See, I thought you guys checked the box marked, try Every other thing.","If you let my sister go, I can help you."
"I'm the one that's supposed to die first. I'm the damaged one, not her. She nEver Even gets a cold.",Damage has a way of spreading to Everyone around you.,"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?"
"Damage has a way of spreading to Everyone around you. For example, your obvious emotional damage is now making me have a philosophical conversation instead of dealing with your sister. See how that might be damaging? House starts to leave, then stops and turn back to Hugo. NEver?","When was the last time you had a cold? Any minor aches, swelling, anything?","Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?"
It's been years. She nEver gets colds.,I didn't ask when's the last time she mentioned it. I asked when she had one Even a tiny one. He takes her oxygen mask away so she can speak.,"Alright here you go, take it back!"
I barely noticed it until that skateboarding tournament in Denver.,How long ago?,"Huh, I never really noticed."
A... year? Cold's nothing when I think of what Hugo goes through Every day. House puts her mask back in place.,"Yeah, we get it. Your brother, the Saint. His sister, the Martyr. He leaves the room. Taubs runs after him.",I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor.
"Yeah, we get it. Your brother, the Saint. His sister, the Martyr. He leaves the room. Taubs runs after him.",Thank God you followed me. Now you can go back to the transplant committee while I get confirmation.,"Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
Confirmation of what?,"What causes low-lEvel cold symptoms for a year, can ruin two lungs, is immune to drug therapies, and gets worse in cities nicknamed Mile-High?","It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord."
A clotting disorder?,She has a nasty case of sickle cell trait.,Does it involve clogs?
I nEver said sickle,"If Everyone were more selfish, the world would be a better place.",I wouldnt be much of a pickle if I could.

Are you sleeping over there yet?,"Nope. She comes over, we hook up, she leaves.","So, wheres your roommate tonight?"
Whose idea was that?,"Mine. But I let her think it's hers. That's the fun of a relationship. You get the sex, the dinners! video game partnership. I also get a full-night's sleep.","There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad."

I won't see you until you stop seeing her.,"Well, that's an argument.","Hey, look, what do you want me to say?"

I was hoping you'd interrupt my cooking to ask about handymen. Do go on.,Would Sam ask you to stop using him because you might have had a sexual relationship with him in the past?,"You didnt think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am."
"Ah, yes, the age-old hooker massage conundrum. Cuddy might have mentioned something about it. Let's say you're right. Completely right about Everything. Give in anyway.",This is not a point of pride. This is a point of principle.,"Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until."
"Right, you're the Rosa Parks of hooker massages.","The principle is she's being irrational. If I give in on this, it sets the stage for the whole relationship.","Yknow, I dont like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!"
"Putting up with irrationality is the foundation for Every relationship. I agree with Sam when she's calling her father a monster. I agree with her when she's calling him a saint. And in exchange, I get to have sex with her. And I'm sure she has similar tradeoffs with me. Relationships are hard. You have to make sacrifices. So sacrifice being crazy. Go get her a gift and apologize.",You finally made a good point.,"Yeah. And I dont understand why youre taking her side. By being my girlfriend, shes saying youre a weirdo, too."
"Which, clearly, you have misunderstood based on how quickly you agreed.",leaving The kitchen's burning.,"What I said was, was that I understood."
What are you doing?,Just letting you all share in the joys of my last trip to Carlsbad Caverns.,"Two, and I know what youre thinking, shes eating them."

I already did. No vegetations. Valves are clear.,Snapilicious!,Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
Is that!? That's baby Chase and his mama! That's adorable!,"NEver mind the baby, peep the babe. Note the cheekbones and eye shape.","How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?"
They do actually look alike.,"I know what you're thinking, Chase wants to sleep with his mom. But who wouldn't hit that if that looked like that? It's a classic case of what Freud called",Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this?
This isn't about Chase's mother. You're wrong.,What do you mean he's wrong? It is about your mom?,No. Not everything is about my mom.
It is about your mom? No.,So it's about!,Except this is totally about my mom.
All we know is we don't see it. Dehydration from the fEver could hide the pneumonia.,"Okay, forget the mom theory. Go water the Patient, treat for Legionnaire's.",Hey! Whats wrong with you? You missed the boat.
Whose idea was Legionnaire's? Dr. Chase's.,"Well, you get major points for trying to trick me.","Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises."
Seriously? A massage from a male hooker?,He was? Huh. That doesn't bother me at all. I guess we both learned a valuable lesson.,"No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couples massage."
"Except that I didn't used to have sex with him, you idiot! Plus, he was a gay hooker.",Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a straight male hooker?,"Well if I didnt have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like"
I'm sure that some part of you beliEves this idiocy. But you can't possibly be stupid enough to think that you can convince any part of me. And that can only mean you're trying to sabotage this relationship.,Why would I do that? We're doing fine.,"Okay, whatever. Yknow what? I dont have time have time to convince you because hes only here for four hours, and Im gonna go see him!"
"Because the next step from fine is serious, and you can't handle that, so you're trying to keep me at arm's length with all this crap.",How about you?,Well I might ask you the same question.
I have been completely open with you.,You won't let me sleep over. You basically haven't introduced me to your daughter.,Fine. Lately I kind of feel like youve been taking me for granted.
But do you want to spend time with her?,"Honestly! before this, I'd have said no. But! yeah. How are we Ever gonna be a couple if you keep hiding her from me?",Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
"House! I need to protect her. I let you into her life, and you go away!",Call it what it is. I'm not the only one who's holding back.,What are you doing in my room?
What's happening to her?,"It's hit her brain, whatEver it is.","Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle."
It could be nothing.,Which would get us nowhere. So let's assume it's something. What kind of something?,"When Im done talking, that arrows falling down on your fat head."
"But her delusions are consistent with mental illness. Bipolar disease, for example. She's 30. It could he hitting her right now for the first time.","So her mind just happens to fall apart right after her body? Wow, I thought I was having a bad week.","All right. All right, everybody, were leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving."
I know it sounds coincidental!,"You know what, I'm back to the Cameron theory. That you hired the dumb version of Cameron so that you could fire her and get rEvenge.","I dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
Give her a break.,"Oh, you've switched sides? Let me guess, Chase represents the dumb version of Thirteen!","Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on."
"I realized if we all just keep pressuring Kelly, of course she's gonna get stuff wrong. It's irresponsible of me to let that happen.",You are a true leader of men. Get someone to cut into her head and get me a biopsy.,God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
"So relapsing, remitting fEver. Malaria. Dengue.","Why wasn't she frozen? This morning? Put a healthy person on a cooling blanket, they'd be Parklled like a fine Chardonnay. She's a nice warm Merlot. 98.6 all day.",Let me see it one more time?
I didn't want her to freeze.,"So you titrated the blanket. As her fEver dropped, you lowered the power.","Figured if I left you frozen like that youd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later."
"As her fEver dropped, you lowered the power. Exactly.",So it's been on the lowest setting since when?,She says theres power in kings blood.
So it's been on the lowest setting since when? Yesterday afternoon.,Which means we could have known that her fEver was gone yesterday afternoon.,Has this been on the entire time?
The antibiotics. Without vomiting?,When did she last puke?,"No, you already threw up once."
Not since she was admitted.,Two down. Shooting for three.,No she hasnt.
You're gonna turn her pacemaker off? You sure that's a good idea?,"Nope. But it might be. He disconnects it. Nothing happens. No tachycardia, there's only the delusions left. If they're Even still there.","Oh, no. Are you sure you dont want to give her a few more minutes?"

What the hell is he talking about? Is it about your ex?,"The ex was not so much a secret, more of a lie.",Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
Know-know about what?,She's sick.,What do you know about anything?
Billy! I'm sParkzophrenic.,That's the kind of thing that a recent psyParkatric resident might have figured out.,Be careful. Oh no!! Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me!
What the hell am I supposed to do now?,Nothing. Her physical symptoms are gone. We'll put her on a different anti-psychotic for the mental ones. You can take a nap.,Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?

You'll figure something out. The two of you have combined I.Q. North of 300.,That's also true of five morons. He leaves.,"Well, you know, were both pretty smart."
So what do we do now?,"Well, considering the fact that I'm about to do something unethical!","Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?"
"Oh, right, yeah! I'm fired.",Missed you.,"Look! Ive got some bad news. Youre fired. You need to pack up your things and go. Im serious, Stanley. Its over. Im sorry."
I'm fired. Missed you.,We need a false positive hep C test.,I did miss you.
And why would we want to do that?,The world changes when you're on the inside. You just gotta roll with it once you get out.,What I mean to say is we dont want to.
"You think he contracted hep C from the Senator, right? Test Anderson. If it's positive, that's evidence Dugan has it, too.","Evidence, not proof.","You dont have to do this, Michael."
Are we presenting this to a jury of our peers? That should be enough for Cuddy.,"Should be, but it won't be.","Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson."
"The test for hep C is 99.9% accurate. That means one in Every thousand test is a false positive. We do enough, maybe we get lucky. disgusted I smell like jail.","False false positive. That's the best we can do? Okay, go do it.","But hey, in my defense II just found out condoms are like only 97% effective."
I think you pRobably already know the answer.,But it doesn't make any sense.,I think you just answered your own question.
You don't understand why a Woman might be upset because her boyfriend lied to her?,I wouldn't be lying as her boyfriend. I'd be lying as her employee.,"Why, Darryl, because Im quote white quote unquote?"
That's not how relationships work.,My Patient is gonna die.,"Well, some people just cant handle that kind of relationship."
Does the lie guarantee he'll live?,No.,"No, I will not."
"Now that you're my doctor, you, uh! You can't tell anybody, right?",Who'd leak a story about a sitting senator who got hep C from doing cocaine?,"Well, Leonards younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon."
Who'd leak a story about a sitting senator who got hep C from doing cocaine? You didn't fill out any paperwork. I'm gonna run this test under an assumed name. Trust me! No one will Ever know you were here. He writes Dugan's name on the blood vial.,"Blood test confirming hep C. He got sicker, his viral load came up, finally showed up on the test.","Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?"
Thank you. There was a time when you would have completely ignored my request. That means a lot that you respect me enough to do this.,"I've come a long way, baby.",Thank you so much for this.
"I've come a long way, baby.",I'm on it. He leaves.,"No, just uh."
I'm on it. He leaves.,How'd you like to come work for me?,"Okay, Im on it!"
It's like I'm on a Mobius strip.,We've had this conversation. You want this job.,I feel like Im in ancient Egypt.
We've had this conversation. You want this job.,"Prove yourself to me, no more games. At least, the current game ends. Others may start. You have my deeply-flawed word.","I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar."
What do I have to do?,Get Dugan to let us give him hep A.,"Be patient, well get there."
I'm not gonna lie to him.,You have a math degree.,You cant trick me.
"Well, technically, it works infinitely better because arsenic has a 0% chance. This is your only shot. Both Dr. House and I beliEve that. He faked a blood test in order to get you approved for this treatment. And then he tried to bribe me into lying to you about the risks. If either of those incidents came to light, he would be suspended and pRobably lose his license.","Oh, I'm sure some other people would suffer.","Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Pennys quality of life."
I did it. And I didn't have to lie.,And you feel good about that?,You did do it?
And you feel good about that? Yes.,So I'm hiring an idiot.,Yeah. And what youre doing feels so good.
"You can pretend you wanted me to lie, but you didn't. You want the people on your team to challenge you otherwise you'd just be a bully instead of a great doctor. You hired me because I don't compromise my principals.",Or I want a front row seat when you wake up and realize how useless your principals are.,His day place.
It's not gonna happen.,See you tomorrow.,"I dont think thats going to happen, Sheldon."
Nothing. I'll see you upstairs.,"If I knew hiring her meant dealing with medical school paperwork, I might've reconsidered. You really got nothing better to do than watch me sign this?","Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what Id do."
And miss the ultimate admission that I was right about Masters all along?,She had me when she called you a coward. You gonna hang out?,Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
Get her a towel. What was in that jar?,Why aren't you guys in my office?,Gimme the bottle.
Why are you in the building? It's 800 in the morning.,Where's Chase? He hands the file to Foreman.,What are you doing here so early?
He's not here because it's 800 in the morning.,"16-year-old girl high fEver, vomiting, bloodshot eyes.",Hes not here right now.
Wow. The case of the really bad flu.,"Hmm, let me see. Did I leave anything out? Oh, yeah. The smallpox. A few seconds of startled silence.","We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it."
Smallpox was eradiCated over 30 years ago.,So were Hush Puppies. Have you checked out your local hipster coffee shop lately?,The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
Smallpox doesn't exist outside of P4 Labs and bio weapon plants.Waving the file She was in Bermuda.,"Where she was scuba diving on the wreck of a Dutch slave ship, that had been intentionally sunk, because an epidemic of smallpox had broken out on board.","Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute."
Was the ship sunk in water? Because viruses can't survive contact with water.,"If the virus had been kept on the outside of an airtight jar, that might be an issue.","Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?"
The virus can't survive over 200 years.,You have.,"My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real."
"Well, theoretically, yes, but","Thank you. He flips the phone shut. So who do we beliEve CDC or Dr. 90210? Isolate, get baseline blood draws for smallpox antibodies and vaccinate the entire family.","Well, its, its possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions."
We should test for the 21st-century suspects varicella and measles.,"You're free to perform whatEver unnecessary tests you want, Foreman. Slavery was abolished years ago.",Maybe I should go!
How do I not panic with that information? Niles and Roger look frozen.,Idiot in exam room one needs antidiarrheals and a dictionary.,"Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions."
You're not scheduled for clinic duty now.,I had some free time. I owed four hours.,So whats your invention?
Don't you have a case?,Yeah.,You dont carry it with you?
Don't you have a case? Yeah.,Are you a Stepford doctor?,Do you have your passport?
"If you're busy, you don't need to be down here.",You're serious.,"You know what, you sound busy, Im gonna let you go."
What if I get someone to sit with her while you run home and get Lamby? I'll get a nurse. Showing his phone Then I have to deal with a! very sick Man.,I think she knows.,"I know. You know, were just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?"
"Who is she, and what does she know?",Cuddy. And! that I faked a lab test and lied to her to save my last Patient.,Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
What did she do?,She let me out of clinic duty by saying I had a case. She's nEver done that.,"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler."
"You don't. If she doesn't know, all you're gonna do by sniffing around is make her suspicious. If she does know, you'll find out soon enough.",What if I die of curiosity in the meantime?,Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
That's none of your business.,"Ah, pRobably just a dry spell.","Im afraid, Im not at liberty to divulge that information."
"House, you do realize we just ruled out smallpox?",You passive/aggressive bitch.,"I just, I miss hanging out with you."
You just asked me,What about Foreman's unnecessary tests?,I wanted to ask you
Negative for varicella and measles. So all of our ideas are off the table.,"I'm putting mine back on. Patient's a diver. Under increased pressure, Everything in the blood gets scared, panics, runs, and hides.",Stanley. Uhh you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Antibodies could be in the joints.,"Tap her knee, ankle, shoulder, and any other joint in her smallpox-ridden body. To Masters Good talk.",We fought dead things and lived to talk about it.
"Tap her knee, ankle, shoulder, and any other joint in her smallpox-ridden body. To Masters Good talk.",You know.,"Well its not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response."
'Cause I wanted you to come to me and apologize.,I can't apologize if I haven't done anything wrong.,"Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you."
There are treatments. We can give you cidofovir.,I don't think you care about the drugs' names.,And now you know how it feels.
What would purple blotches mean? Hemorrhagic-type smallpox.,"In which case, her chances are more like! Shaq hitting a free throw.","Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present."
Like more of those gross bumps?,No. It's just a regular rash.,Did you start waxing?
W-what does that mean?,It means it's not smallpox. The parents look reliEved and hug.,Knock it off or Ill start making WH sounds for words that just have a W.
"Please step out of the room. I'm Dr. Broda, Head of Infection control, CDC, and your protective suits are not adequate.",Turns out they don't have to be.,"Well, no no, you have to stay back."
Rash is consistent with smallpox.,Not if it presents after pustules.,You can call off the roommate search!
"She's pRobably just allergic to the bedsheets or the hospital gown, and you simply didn't notice it House and Taub exchange looks. We're gonna airlift blood and tissue samples to Atlanta. We'll have the DNA results in 18 hours. In the meantime, please, step out of the room.",You brought the plane? Cool.,Oh thatd be me.
"When we left, Julie's fEver had climbed to over 103.",You know how you can tell there's nothing to be done? Chase showed up.,"Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldnt take it."
It's the middle of the night in the Netherlands. Nobody's working.,"Oh, you can always find someone.",Its the middle of the night.
Just do the translation.,She can translate howEver she feels most comfortable.,"I thought I would, but the translations no good."
"House, the hospital has translators on call","Shut up. He enters his card number, then turns back and hands out Masters a post-it. Honey, could you email our new friend the Captain's log?","Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me!"
"On morning of 14, July, I boarded Sotos Ooslerzoon with two trunks and my cat. Aw! The Captain had a cat.",Isn't she adorable? Go ahead and skip to the part where people get sick.,Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
"Mm, no. It say only African men sick.",It can't be smallpox. Airborne transmission means it's an equal-opportunity killer. We're looking for a disease that discriminates.,Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
Captain and crew got clean drinking water. Slaves drank whatEver they could. Scrofula. That's what they called cervical T.B. lymphadenitis in the 1700s.,Scrofulicious that's what they called annoying in the 1700s.,"The captain to that ship What was he, Braavosi?"
"T.B. might fit, but it's too slow-moving to kill her anytime soon. There's no way the CDC's gonna give us access.","That's why we don't think it's T.B. We think it's meningococcal disease, which could kill her before the results come back.",Im afraid that Artoos sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
"And once I gain access, I run the T.B. Test. You could have said all that in there.",In front of the narc? As if.,How do you know Im not using the facilities?
"Are you so afraid of this new girl, we have to take elaborate measures Every time you want to skirt around ethical boundaries?","Elaborate measures? We took a walk a walk you would have taken anyway. Actually, I saved you from the horrible post-differential traffic jam.","So, what, you think Im just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?"
This is not meningococcus. You're not getting in here.,Cool.,"Nono, its ooozing, oozing."
Not really not for them and not for you the dad's new symptoms are consistent with them having smallpox.,Would be if he had a headache.,Theyre just having a little trouble communicating.
He does have a headache.,"No. He just said, ow, and held his head.",Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction.
"Actually, he said, ow.Then he said, it's a headache.",Which could be indicative of head pain.,"Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?"
We're back to T.B.?,We nEver left.,"Thomas, come back here!"
We'll need to do a C.T. And I sort of have a hunch that the CDC's not gonna approve of us moving the Patient.,"Chase, can I talk to you outside for a second? Masters looks suspicious.","If you dont want what most men want, then youd better tell me what youd like me to do."
You just tried this. I'm not a better liar than Foreman.,"Sure, you are.",That might be a little more convincing if you didnt have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
That's 60-year-old technology that killed Patients.,Exactly. He'll compromise on the C.T.,Is it like for dinosaur emergencies.
You don't trust me.,Going behind your back works better when you're not facing us.,You cant move at all?
"Instead of whatEver lie you're gonna tell Broda, why don't you just tell him the truth? House looks desperate If we are honest and reasonable",People of all races and creeds will live together in peace and harmony.,I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark.
How did your first plan work out?,Permission granted.,What did you have in mind for your next move?
Thank you. She leaves them. House turns back to Chase.,"After she gets denied, do the bait and switch.","Carol and Susans, Carol is running to answer the door."
"Yeah. I'll be right back. to Sam, who now looks deflated. You know, I'm pretty sure Lamby has a cousin down in the gift shop.","Hold off a minute. I'm in overtime. He tries again, loses. Masters jumps a little, surprised, then giggles. Oh!",Just promise me that whatever happens youll take care of little Sam.
"Uh, Broda agreed to C.T. the dad's brain.","Well, that sucks.",Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
But I thought that's what you wanted.,I shouldn't have gotten it with the truth. He's a hypocrite. His position Ever since he's been here has been,I didnt even get to tell you what I wanted!
"I-I pointed out that either we're right, and he's the hero for ending the crisis, or he's right, and he gets to be the first person to look at a brain infected with smallpox. C.T. scans weren't around 30 years ago.",Good work.,An actual real scientist.
So I guess honesty is the best policy.,"Why'd you say that? Seriously! To establish your viewpoint, as if I didn't already know it, or to demonstrate some weird cross-generational female solidarity with Cuddy?","Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble."
"Actually, I was just trying to fill the awkward silence.",Oh. Looking back to the CDC crew. They are wheeling the dad back in his room. Why have they stopped? He opens the door and enters the hallway.,"All right, But Im given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, its more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat."
You can't go out there.,Why did you stop?,Cant get out that way.
Get out of the hallway.,He does not have smallpox.,Youd better hope I dont see you in the hallway!
He's just dEveloped pustules. He's now too dangerous to transport. Get out of the hallway.,What about the daughter?,"Come back in, Sheldon, hes not going to hurt you."
Pustule count is way up. Vitals are way down.,"Means I was wrong. But to be precise, I was right before I was wrong, so!","Quick question uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?"
We might as well keep,"We have our diagnosis. If you're eager, you can go find us a new case. Masters leaves.","You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare."
Julie doesn't have smallpox.,Did I just dream the part where I finally agreed it was smallpox?,"Ooh, Julies so smart, Julies so special."
She doesn't have pustules on her palms or the soles of her feet.,The dad does have pustules there.,How could you not tell me that she has hair?
"You do realize we don't all live together, right?","Well, then just we gave it to him. No pustules on the daughter's palms, so!","No, I mean just you and me."
"So therefore your theory is you asked me to take the dad's blood, but I accidentally injected him with smallpox.","Exactly, although technically, it was the vaccinia virus, which is what the smallpox vaccine is made from.","Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying youre my halfbrother?"
You sound like one of those anti-vaccine cranks. You can't dEvelop full-blown symptoms from the vaccine this quickly.,You can if you're immunocompromised. Am I the only one who reads these things? he waves the dad's file. Dad had kidney cancer.,"No Dr. Skeptismo! Im sure. First of all, okay, theres the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mothers favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I havent seen this smile in 17 years!"
Six years ago. He's been in remission.,"Well, it's obviously back.",Five months ago.
Then what does the daughter have?,Damn. I was hoping you weren't gonna ask me that. Can we please just focus on the disease we just diagnosed and can treat?,"Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare."
Damn. I was hoping you weren't gonna ask me that. Can we please just focus on the disease we just diagnosed and can treat?,"What's more likely he got smallpox the day after we immunized him for it, or he's sick from the vaccine itself?",Well I wouldve been happy because I wouldve be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love.
You got any proof the kidney cancer is back?,"Well, let me give him this.",It was in my weekly email blast.
"You know who Janet Parker is? In 1978, she was working at a university in England. Someone in a research lab on the floor below screwed up. Some smallpox virus Managed to float up through the vents into the room where she was working. She died four days later the last known person to die from smallpox. And the person in charge of the lab was so destroyed, he killed himself. Now that he's shedding, I can't open that door for anyone. He turns to leave. House looks in the room and notices something.","Hey! Look, there's the proof you need. There's blood in the urine bag.",I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
His kidneys are shutting down. He's in the final stages of the disease.,"If smallpox was causing the kidney failure, the blood would be brown. It's red because the kidney cancer is back, and this is not smallpox.",Maybe hes going to church.
I'm not opening that door.,"Well, that makes one of us. When the CDC doctor in the dad's room unlock the door to get out, House quickly enters the room.","If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it."
Hey! Hey! You're insane!,But I'm right. He injects interferon in the dad's IV.,"Mmhmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?"
"This is what happens when you have no respect for authority, no respect for anything.",You don't think it's a little much to use the threat of death to win a totally separate argument with your boyfriend?,"Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. Its a trash can."
You think this is about the other thing?,Does seem to track suspiciously closely.,"Well, whats the other thing, what do I think?"
Does seem to track suspiciously closely.,"And if I do, does that mean I win both arguments?","Well, its, its possible it was tracking everywhere you went."
Which means this is smallpox.,Right! 'Cause there are only two diseases in the whole wide world what else could it be?,I have come to an important decision.
You have any fEver?,"Not yet. But when it does come, I assume you'll see the pettiness of being mad at me for lying.",That really is something thats really cool.
"I'm not gonna make it, am I?","You should say good-bye to your family. Niles pants, then nods. House unhooks lines, then wheels the bed close to the glass wall. He steps back near Cuddy.","Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, dont have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove em wherever you want, I dont care."
The suit will protect you if you haven't already been exposed.,My air supply's almost out.,"Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to whats underneath it."
We'll give you another canister.,"Yeah, and when I change it, I will be exposed.",I have to go down and get another barrel.
I wish I could.,"Oh, that's great, 'cause you know what you can do? You can move me. You don't know that I have smallpox yet.","I cant. Even if I wanted to, Im a bastard. A Snow."
The pRoblem is getting him from here to there.,So it's inconvenient. My having a fighting chance at life is inconvenient!,We should get him a bus ticket.
"House, you have to examine the body.",I'm not going anywhere near it.,The apartment. Monte is in pieces on the table.
"Step back, Dr. House. House uncovers the body, still oozing blood, and starts examining it, but is bothered by his gloves.",It's kind of hard to do an autopsy in oven mitts.,"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
Take them off.,Says the Woman standing behind two panes of glass.,"Come on, take em off!"
"Do you beliEve me? Forget me. Do you beliEve you? You think it's rickettsialpox, don't you? If it is, it's curable, and she's gonna die unless we can prove it.",You really are annoying. He takes the gloves off and examines the body closer. Broda gestures to the CDC men to make them hurry.,"Coo, again. Dont blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her."
"Come on, House. Come on. The two men enter the room and come close to House, still moving the body.",Eschar. Eschar! He shows them a tiny black patch. The men nod to Broda. Everyone looks reliEved.,Hi. Were the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Hey. Lulu hugs him.,Buy you breakfast?,Can somebody else hug him?
"Buy you breakfast? No, thanks.",You can pay! if it's starting to feel like I'm carrying you.,I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.
Abajo! Get him down!,"What you got against Parkckens? One got choked last night, thanks to you.",What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?
"33-year-old male with hemoptysis, fEver!",Can't we Even talk about it?,I believe the backscratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
"You can't apologize, we can't talk. And puncture wounds.",I'm not apologizing for doing the right thing.,"No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
Lying to me was not the right thing. Puncture wounds are from a crucifixion.,I lied to save my Patient's life.,Your father crucified innocent children.
"The Hospital's ChairMan of the Board? I'm not gonna stand him up, and neither are you.",I loathe weddings and their sEven lEvels of hypocrisy.,"He doesnt need to sit, hes a traveling salesman."
as House gets into the elevator You're also going to the rehearsal dinner Friday night. Dressy casual.,"Housekeeping. Either you're crazy or you're atoning for something naughty, and you're crazy.","Ok, youre gonna come back with some very classy clothes."
I'm not atoning for anything.,That answers that. Thanks.,Ive condemned no one.
"looking at his daughter My Marisa was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Stage IV glioblastoma. When the doctors said she had two months to live, that's when I made my bargain.",With your health insurance carrier?,Ive always had a special place in my heart for Leonard.
looking at House With God.,Oh.,What are you watching?
I told him I would nail myself to a cross Every year he kept her alive.,So how did that negotiation go? You lowballed with ear piercing and God countered?,"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!"
"Three weeks later, she was cancer-free. And that was four years ago.",Pontius Pilate misunderstood oncologist.,Wow! Didnt she die like five years ago?
My ex-wife thinks I'm crazy too. She moved out the first time I did this.,"Well, at least your daughter has one viable role model.","Oh, not crazy at all."
You don't beliEve in God?,I did. Then I grew my curly hairs.,You dont believe in evolution?
So how do you think I was cured?,Maybe you were misdiagnosed in the first place.,"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed."
"You have your answer, doctors. We have ours.",Causal determinism.,And an Aquaman action figure.
"If you're done mocking him, we need to prep for an LP.",Good. Another hole in him should really make God's day.,"Well no, when I get to the point where."
Good. Another hole in him should really make God's day.,Why are you late?,"Oh, thats great."
I had a flat tire. Your Patient has cancer?,"Your tires got less than 5,000 miles on them. No, and neither does my Patient's daughter.",We got a flat and couldnt get the tyre off.
In three weeks? It's highly unlikely.,There's no construction site between here and your home. I agree. I think it was a misdiagnosed cyst.,"Well, dont get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen."
"But there is one between here and my dry cleaner. It could be a misdiagnosis, or it could be spontaneous remission. But! why would I lie about this?",I don't know yet. But you would have dropped off your tie. It's got a mustard stain.,"Yeah, Im not even sure if its the right word."
I was buying an engagement ring. smiling I'm gonna propose to Sam at the wedding.,looking at the ring That is the second stupidest thing I've heard today.,Were gonna pick up the wedding dress then were gonna have lunch with mom.
I assume you haven't apologized to Cuddy yet. Your stupidity deMands equal time.,Nothing to apologize for.,"Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard."
pausing for a split second Pretend to apologize.,You want me to lie?,"Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology."
There's a lovely symmetry to it. The lie got you into it. A lie gets you out of it.,Everybody lies. I'm sure Cuddy!,"Look, its one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"
Everybody lies. I'm sure Cuddy!,getting up and hurrying out the door Just need to give her a chance.,"You dont have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen yearold girl."
"looking inside Ramon's mouth Then again, maybe we were wrong.","FEver, coughing up blood, coughing up teeth. So either God sweetened the deal with a no flossing clause or!","You know, were not that far from Vazquez Rocks."
"Heavy metal poisoning fits. Canned tuna, sushi, lead paint.",Heavy metal it is. Do a home search and a peripheral smear.,Whats that animal doing in our apartment?
stopping I can't. I have a personal errand to run.,He stops and turns to Taub Trying to catch your wife cheating?,"What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!"
Oh! Why would you say that?,Missing mojo. Posture's slumped. Expression defeated. Didn't try to back up,"My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot."
Missing mojo. Posture's slumped. Expression defeated. Didn't try to back up,Shopkeeper. I need a Patient file.,Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
I need a Patient file. Ask records.,Not one of our Patients. My Patient's daughter.,Whys the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
Ask your Patient.,He thinks I only want it to Debunk his faith.,"The first date weve had in months, and they were both such disasters."
And why would he think that?,Because he's strangely perceptive for an idiot.,"Wha wh why, why, why does he suspect that?"
And I'm going to violate Patient privacy laws just to keep you happy?,"You keep me happy, I return the favor. Think of it as tat for tit.","Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?"
"When we're at work, we need to focus on our work thoughts. she finally notices his clothing choice Why are you wearing that?",It's my dressy casual. What do you think?,"Well, youre wearing it at the office."
"You look like Wilson. It looks weird. Well, you knew I'd think that. Which makes me wonder why you look disappointed.","If you prick me, do I not bleed?","Okay, how do I look?"
"You knew I wouldn't like it, but you thought I would say I did. That's what this is about. You're trying to trap me into lying to you.",You sure? 'Cause that sounds so juvenile. Cuddy leaves,"Okay, I have to tell you something, but youre not going to like it."
Taub was right. He just didn't know why.,It's locked.,He felt surprise was wiser.
from inside his office I'm busy!,I'll wait.,He is not here right now.
I really am busy.,"Cuddy got me the daughter's file. Well, not Cuddy exactly. Her signature. Well, not exactly her signature.","Uh, actually, I think Im gonna be busy."

"Hears voices, thinks he's the son of God. PRobably SParkzophrenic.",I think you offended him.,Its a little hard to explain.
A neuro disorder could explain all his delusions.,Get an MRI of his brain. Let's see if we can find God.,And how do you propose to do that?
Heard you got the daughter's file. Patient change his mind?,I forged your signature.,Have you heard back from Emily?

When those areas get messed with, people have strange experiences like hauntings, alien abductions, past lives.","You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess."

Which is no explanation.","The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat youre going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beadyeyed little mother whos been biting you all week."
Sometimes there is no explanation. And I'm just fine with that.,Which annoys me to no end.,Its just hard to explain.
"I need that file, that chair, and that desk.","Your Woman is fudging the facts. Five of those cases, the stated doses don't explain the radiation damage.","Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? Theres a special filing cabinet for things from corporate."

I hate rehearsal dinners almost as much as I hate weddings.,The only reason anyone gets married is that homo erectus females needed protection from predators while breastfeeding.,Yeah. I think maybe I want a wedding wedding.

into the phone Yeah.,to Cuddy You're gonna have to go stag. My Patient is refusing treatment.,"Thats right, I have a phone in here."
And you care?,No. But it's an excuse you can't argue with.,I was waiting for you.
Accepting this treatment is an insult to God. I can't expect him to keep our deal.,You already broke it. Your blood test showed you were loaded with ibuprofen.,Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Taking painkillers breaks my deal?,"The point is to suffer like your savior did, right?",No worse child ever stained this land.

"Just to be clear, this whole little act isn't gonna work. I need an apology. Not flattery.",It's not an act. It's the wedding.,"Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today."
You hate weddings.,I thought I did. Then I realized I've nEver been to one.,"Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend."
Then I realized I've nEver been to one. NEver?,Turns out they're kind of fun.,Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
I don't know. But I do know that it's something I need right now. Taub turns and leaves her,What would you wear?,I do not know.
"Well, I'm a sucker for the white gown.","Traditionally for young, first-time brides.",Its a lovely gown.
"Well, I may not be young, but I'll be first-time. She refills her glass at a champagne fountain",That is a lie.,You know what?

Ugh. I hate weddings.,It won't be long now. You'll be staring down the yawning void before you know it.,"Well, hey, at least youre getting a proper wedding."
You came from a wedding to tell me that?,Nope. I came from a wedding to run a PET scan.,"I should just go on to happier things, okay?"
I thought you'd given up on me.,I have. PET scan was for your daughter. I was wrong about her. She did have glioblastoma. And she still does. The cancer nEver went away.,House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.
"Yes, it did. They tested her Every year. With a CT scan.","Which misses all the tiny, little tumors that a PET scan doesn't.",She looks like Pam from the neck down.
You've made a mistake. She does not have cancer anymore.,I ran it twice. No mistake. Looks like God broke your deal. I'm sorry. But I'm also right.,But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.
You're a bastard. Do whatEver you want to me.,Good call.,"As you wish, lad."
He's bluffing. Get House.,Got something to show you.,"wow, are you still going to move in with him?"
You tricked me. God didn't break our deal. I did. You led me into temptation. And I followed.,And God will punish you for that.,"Im not tricking you, Theon."
He has to.,"Cause if he didn't, well, that would make you wonder, wouldn't it?",Yes. Hes got to stand up to this mafia guy.
"Cause if he didn't, well, that would make you wonder, wouldn't it? He will.","Well, that's why I'm so confused by this.",But if he doesnt?
Who is that?,God.,We can still see something.
"God. You broke your deal with him, your daughter's fine, you're getting better. Nothing bad happened. Which can only mean one thing. There is no God. Of course, if your daughter gets hit by a meteorite today, I would have some serious egg on my face.",You're smiling. I assume that means you're miserable.,"The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didnt."
It means I'm happy. It doesn't mean God doesn't exist. It just means he's-he's truly merciful. My beautiful Marisa was right. God is all about love.,"Punishment is proof of God, and no punishment is proof of God? Ingenious argument.","When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumbass daddy."
moving quickly to catch up to House Everyone else knew?,Everyone I could trust. So yes.,"Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?"
"If you had told me, he'd be dead by now. So why do I still want to tell the truth?",Either you're nave or you have scruples. I'm not sure which is worse.,"Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?"
This is insane. We can't work like this.,I can.,I cannot work like this!
"to House, who has entered the office Good work today. I don't Even think your Patient's gonna sue. It looks like Everybody's happy.",I've been an idiot.,"No, no, no."
Sam left me.,What a moron.,Sam! Dont let them send us away.
Too soon. I'm still in love with her.,I meant you.,I miss her so much.
Do you have a drink? Or drinks?,Cuddy's coming over.,Does anyone want a drink?
looking up at House Does she know you're here?,I apologized to her.,"You know shes at my parents house, right?"
standing up and looking at House Good for you.,Not really. I lied. He turns to face Wilson I just took your advice. Too bad you didn't.,"Uh, Im just, Im just looking out your window."
"You're right. EKG is more interesting than loss of consciousness, so","God, she's still talking. Make it stop.","Oh come on, not again."
"The guy did a wonderful thing. Can't we just take that at face value? House sits at the table. Masters gives him a file with his name on a post it, too.",You are adorable. Heroism does exist.,"I know, you and me both, brother."
What about the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson?,News flash that guy was already on the plane.,He was a soldier.
What about firefighters?,The guys who undergo months of training to deny their own instincts for self-preservation?,Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.
So huManity is apathetic and self-serving?,Yeah.,Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
Laugh all you want. The other hundred people stayed on that platform. That's a normal response to danger.,The coward has spoken.,And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesnt have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
He could have died. Did you Even think about your family?,I need your advice. Dinner with your mom on Thursday.,I dont think he had a family.
You should go.,What? I can't. It's your birthday.,Maybe I should go!
"Oh, it's-it's-it's fine. It's sweet that you care about your friend, and, frankly, as you will find out sooner or later, my mother is a handful. Go.",I need your advice. This film festival.,"Oh, no, I should apologize."
I have had these tickets for two months.,"Yeah, I know. I'm definitely coming.",Do what you want.
I'm definitely coming. Okay.,"But Thursday is Cuddy's birthday, and her mom's coming down it's a whole dinner thing.",...Oh... yeah. Definitely... Ill be there. For sure.
You have to go. Your girlfriend's birthday? It's not Even a question.,"She has one Every year. How often do you break up with the love of your life? Considering it Okay, for you, it's more often than most, but still!","Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
Give me the catheter. Get a crash cart. Alarm beeping. Masters runs to the crash cart. He's in cardiac arrest. Maybe your second time will go better.,So we finally know what Taub would look like if he were life-size. He smiles smugly.,Whats... whats the matter? What... what happened in there?
Can we go back to the office now?,"You kidding? We got a differential to run. He hangs his cane on the bus shelter, pulls out a sharpie and start scribbling on the glass. Cardiac arrhythmia.",Really? Were going to do an experiment?
"Arrhythmia proves I was right. Jack's pRoblem is his heart, not his brain.","So when you're not on a jbo25eza9a, you sleep with nurses. But when you are, you sleep with your wife. I think you got that backwards.","I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?"
Both of our Patients' cardiac incidents happened after physical stress. I'm guessing vasovagal syncope?,Buzzkill. He goes back to writing on the glass.,I wouldnt put it past her.
"What about autonomic nervous system dysfunction? It could cause arrhythmia and fainting. We finally see what House was doing. He has improved Taub's picture, making him look very close to Hitler. Taub facepalms with both hands.","Inappropriate? I mean, 'cause of the Jew thing? Autonomic nervous system dysfunction I like it. He caps the pen. Let's biopsy his pituitary gland.",Us? The only reason youre here is that Jaime Lannister told me you werent safe in the capital. Youre hundreds of miles from Kings Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. Youre safe.
"Adrenal venous sampling makes more sense and is a less invasive procedure! which you don't care about, because you just want to check the pituitary, because you still think there's something wrong with the guy's brain?",Can't fool you.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?"
He has no other symptoms for pituitary disease. We can't stick a needle in his brain because you don't beliEve in heroism.,"Fine, do it your way. You'll waste half a day, but I'm sure he's in no hurry to get better.","Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And Im sorry, but youre wearing more perfume than I am."
How can I help?,I forgot.,How can you help me?
And just what is so exciting you have to blow off both of us to do it?,"I just want to sit on my couch in my underwear, drink scotch, and watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey!","Knowing youre here, waiting for me I think its kinda exciting."
"Pneumonitis can be caused by bacteria, parasite, some kind of an obstruction.",Who was the girl on the tracks?,Mommy is so proud of you.
News story said her name was Chloe Jeffries. Why does that matter?,'Cause there's another reason besides being sick that he'd risk his life for a stranger.,Why is it your last name and her first name?
The most likely cause of pneumonitis is infection. Shouldn't we be getting a sputum culture?,There's no significant elevation of white blood cell count. This is more like toxic exposure.,"Youre really a broken toy, arent you?"
Why is your assumption of his guilt more valid than my assumption of his selflessness?,"Because my assumption is backed up by millions of men, and Taub, who've cheated on their wives. Find the girl and the love nest. Every hero has his Kryptonite.",I cant believe you dont trust me.
"Question is, how'd they get sick? Kryptonite.","EKG's unremarkable, thyroid, liver, and kidney function seems fine.",Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
"I wish that you would take a second look. I'm tired all the time, and when it's cold, I get this weird pain in my shoulder.",I have a pain in my leg. You don't hear me complaining! small smile Except for just now.,"No. No, you didnt. we didnt give you this."
How do doctors get this idea you're better than Everyone else?,PRobably all that pulling people back from the brink of death. It's just a guess.,"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if Im the best of the people they see, they give me the part."
"That's hard to beliEve, since you're currently shtupping her. She turns back to a stunned, speechless House.",We have a situation.,"Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay?"
"No, it's not my head. It's my ears.","When I saw her lying there, I thought, 'I can't just stand here and let her die. She has her whole life to live.'",We ought to have this thing serviced.
He didn't jump because he was sick or because he knew that girl. Even you have to admit that now. House shows the newspaper to Taub. There is the PPTH ad on it. Taub turns the paper with his face down to the table.,"Yes, but that doesn't make him a hero. It makes him an idiot. The only reason that headline doesn't say moron crushed by train is luck.","Rosss apartment, Phoebe has moved in and has a massage client on her table shes set up in the living room."
Ear pain fits with my theory. Jack has an infection that's spread to his mastoid.,"Great. We'll confirm that in a week, when your secret cultures have sprouted.",I gather Jack and Ben havent been getting along lately.
Am I in trouble?,"I only get mad when you waste my time. Couldn't care less about yours. But let me know when they come back negative, and I'll mock you.",You realize you cant win.
You have a better idea?,"Nope, so I'm gonna pick one at random. Acoustic neuroma.",Ive got a better solution.
"A tumor in the ear makes sense. And if it's putting pressure on the breathing centers in his brain, explains the lungs.",The lungs explain the heart.,Will you at least think about it?
The lungs explain the heart.,Evoked auditory potential test. This counts as my time. He leaves.,"Oh, I love that guy!"
"You guys got this? He leaves, too.",I have been going out of my way to be nice to old Jewish ladies for months now on the off chance one of them could be your mom.,Oh! Well thats it! Hes the last one to go. Im locking you guys in.
She converted when she married my dad.,"You see, now is too late.",She was my mother too.
"I'm not blaming you for this. She's the one who ambushed you to find out what you were like, because I nEver tell her anything.","I'd have to agree with her on that one. Anyway, I obviously can't come to dinner now.","Okay, look, its not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend."
"Anyway, I obviously can't come to dinner now. Obviously?","Well, she's crazy, and she hates me.",Fine! Lets just go. I dont need your stupid dinner.
"You're her mother. All I know is, when you and your sister were growing up, you ate what we ate. No excuses.",Would you pass the salt? Arlene smiles and picks up the salt. Cuddy snatches it and hands it to House. Arlene rolls her eyes.,"I dont know who you talked to, but that wasnt my mother."
"I'm sure it's very interesting. I didn't read any studies. I just raised Parkldren. Wilson shakes his fork, nervously, then his head. Arlen turns to Cuddy. It's not your fault. How are you supposed to keep up with what she eats all day? You're nEver home.",I'm sorry. I have to get this. He leaves the room and whispers pleadingly Tell me you need me.,Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
We don't need you here. We just need to figure out why this guy's body thinks his ear is on his back.,Because his ear used to be something else.,"Well hurry, I cant feel my ears!"
"Sometimes the body screws up, and they keep the old area codes, report to the same pain centers. Referred pain.",Looks and brains.,"Dont move. Code AA23, AA23."
Hyperthyroidism would explain all his symptoms.,Or it could be his liver.,Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.
"For the record, referred pain does not rule out infection",Were you like this when you were working for your math degree?,Can you believe how pushy she is?
That's actually a really interesting question. Cuddy and House both glare at him.,I'm an atheist.,"Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know?"
"Oh, my God. She gets up quickly, checks her mother's eyes while Wilson checks her pulse. She then looks back to House, who is quietly sipping his coffee. She realizes. Did you! Angrily sedate my mother? Wilson looks almost reliEved and smiles a little.",Kicked in just in time.,I did the first time!
"Leaving aside the fact that House is a sociopath, I have to admit that I'm-I'm honestly reliEved. Your mom is quite a h quite a handful. What? I feel f His eyes open wide when he understands. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Speaking gibberish that sound sort of like You drugged me again?",Sorry.,"Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I dont, I, I really dont know why. Tonight? Sure, thatd be great. Okay, Ill, Ill see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research."
"He seized three times last night. We got him stabilized, but barely.","If there was nothing wrong with his brain before, there sure is now.","Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?"
Any particular reason we need to be looking at the Patient?,"Yes. Cuddy's mom is in my office, and she looks mad.","Uh, to speak my truth, Id appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation."
Our Patient also dEveloped a raging fEver overnight. That means Masters was right all along. This is an infection.,Should we give you a minute to gloat?,And what will that be on the side of?
"We still don't know what kind of infection could be bacterial, viral, fungal. Until the cultures",You are the worst gloater Ever.,"Oh, I dont mean to be a square, but Id really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep?"
Her starting those cultures when she did means we're 24 hours closer to the answer.,"We're sorry your husband croaked, but at least we were 24 hours closer to the answer. Let's narrow it down, shall we?","Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a fiveyear mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal fiveweek mission to do the same."
"I can't confirm any of this yet, and we don't have time to choose wrong.","It fits, and since it's the only idea on the table, I say it's a winner.",Do you really know which one is correct?
You a doctor?,Sure. You're on new meds. Go back to sleep.,"Fine, but Im telling you, its terrible."
Am I gonna die?,"Well, I hope not, 'cause then I'd have to go back to my office.","Well, that depends on how old she is."
They're saying I'm a hero?,"Yeah, but, you know, in a few days, a panda bear will give birth to triplets, and we'll all move on.","Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can..."
"Hey, um! How long are you gonna sit there?",Could be hours.,"Oh my God, sit down!"
Hiding behind a sick guy! That's heroic. He laughs weakly.,I can explain. Sometimes I mix up my medications.,"Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him."
I don't Even remember going to bed last night. I must have had too much to drink. I do know I can be difficult.,You were a little bitchy.,I couldnt sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us.
"In the clinic, you were a complete schmendrick, but once you knew I was Lisa's mother, you held your tongue. That's because you love her. House looks uncomfortable. I still think you're a pain in the ass with a God complex, and I'll kill you if you hurt her, but I'm glad she has you.","We don't have to hug now, do we?","So, here you are."
What do you think? She scoffs. I've got a train to catch.,I thought you were staying till Sunday.,"Look, I uh, I shouldnta come."
"I'm coming down with a cold. Every time I stay with Lisaor her sister, one of those rug rats gets me sick. Parkldren are awful. She closes the door and leaves.",Did she have a rash recently?,"Umm, listen, Im gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick."
"FEverish, itchy? No.",What is she doing here anyway? It's the middle of the morning. Shouldn't she be in school?,And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.
I'm keeping her out for a few days. There's been a little outbreak,Parkcken pox.,There you go!
"You think Jack has Parkcken pox? But he doesn't have blisters. He's not itchy, and Daisy nEver got it.",I know.,"Oop, got some blisties."
Culture confirmed Jack does have Parkcken pox. It just took six hours longer.,"Autopsy works too. FYI, turns out your hero is a loser. He's going back on the road.","Hey! Uhoh, looks like were under a Jack attack!"
He still risked his life for that Woman.,That was impulse.,He did. He fought bravely.
Then what are we doing?,"You know, you turned out remarkably close to normal, considering the genes in play.","But were not going to, are we?"
"You know, you turned out remarkably close to normal, considering the genes in play. Thanks.",Here! In case your mom comes back. He gives her a prescription bottle tied with a red bow. Happy Birthday.,"Truthfully, Ive never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential."
Here! In case your mom comes back. He gives her a prescription bottle tied with a red bow. Happy Birthday.,"Yes. A beat. Oh, no, I can't.","If I may, I, Id like to propose a toast."
"Oh, no, I can't. Wilson.","It's, uh, bowling night. He'll nEver forgive me if I don't. Cuddy gives him a look. Oh, screw it. I'm coming.",I cant!! I cant!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!

Thanks. We can wean him off,"Steroids isn't fascinating, it's moronic.","Well, thanks, we like him."
It's hardly surprising you agree with our Patient's philosophy. You run your department like a boot camp. As if cruelty ensures perforMance.,"long pause Oh, is this where I'm supposed to disagree with you?",You clearly have no intention of saving your mens lives.
The diagnosis of urinary retention depends on the particular mechanical cause. We need to know if there's a blockage in the urethra versus a nerve or a muscle pRoblem with the bladder.,Fascinating!,"Well, yes, and youre listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer."
"Fascinating! without misdirect. Cath him and see what's stopping him from emptying his bilge. He gets up to leave but stops at the door. Oh, not you, Chase. Sending Captain Micropenis to deal with what is pRobably normal-sized equipment, it's too cruel, Even for me.","Good morning. Rachel gets up and surprises him, with a huge smile on her face. And what brings the lesser Cuddy to these parts?","If you dont mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until youve gotten him back to your workshop."
"Pediatrician appointment for an s-h-o-t. Waldenwood insists vaccination reports go in with the application. To Rachel. Honey, finish your oatmeal.",Waldenwood. Is that by any chance a boarding school? Or a work camp?,I cant believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
It's our first-choice preschool.,Blocks made of gold! Kids don't have to pick their own noses!,And that day care is great.
Great facilities and teachers. And they're known for their gifted program.,You sure that's the right place for her? Sounds a little snobby.,"I know its an excellent school, Dwight."
Let me go. Let me go!,She's fine. How 'bout we get back to someone who isn't?,"Let go, let go of me!"
"The Patient's in restraints and on Haldol, which seems to have made him lucid.","Differential diagnosis. Back pain, neurogenic bladder, psychosis.","The Hospital, Marcel lies on the operating table while recovering from the anaesthetic, tucked up under a sheet like an infant in a huge bed."
A symptom which we learned about when he choked me. Hate to slow us down by acknowledging it.,And yet you have. Tertiary syphilis fits.,True. Ive had a similar observation. Its certainly something I could never do with my husband.
Unless he didn't know about it. Maybe one of those kids at the camp got tired of Driscoll's lessons and poisoned him.,Go to the camp. Check for potential poisons. The guys leave the room. House stops Masters before she does too.,"Okay. Okay honey, hes fine, hes fine, lets just put him down. Come here, Ben. See thats a good boy. How could you do that to him!!

Cuddy wants to get Rachel into Waldenwood preschool. The pRoblem is, Rachel's dumber than a paste sandwich.","Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room."
And her not getting in bothers you. You care about Rachel. That was not advice.,"Cuddy cares about her. When Rachel gets rejected, Cuddy will be upset. And as the boyfriend, I will be expected to be supportive and consoling.","No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careII love Rachel."
"Not your strengths, I grant you. Leave it alone. It's just a play date. It'll be fine.","Play date being their code for way to weed out the paste sandwiches. They'll hand her puzzles and counting games, and Rachel will just sit there and eat the pieces.","All Im saying is that its a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance."

How soon after the admissions session did the Parkld get sick?,"The kid barely got home before she collapsed. Her parents are a wreck. Desperate for answers. Have you experienced any symptoms, or does someone else oversee these sessions?","Roll him, roll him, roll him."
The teachers supervise. No one's mentioned feeling sick. I'd love to call the family and offer my support.,"Sorry, I can't rEveal names. Doctor-Patient confidentiality. So this is where all the admissions play dates happen? She wouldn't have been in another room?","Well sure, if you say youre gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you."

We had to put him on a diltiazem drip to regulate his heart.,That means he's running out of time.,"Oh, the poor thing."
That means he's running out of time. Pointing at Masters It means you are too. Your campaign to soften him up so he would go easier on the kids! All in a pointless attempt to validate your own upbringing.,Another cardiac arrhythmia?,Hes been saying that since he was little.
"No. BeliEve me, I asked. Those were some fun conversations.",Do you beliEve the answers?,"Of course, I did."
Delivery for Dr. Chase.,That's me.,The delivery suite.

What is that?,"Dog training clicker. Gives immediate positive reinforcement, bridging the precious seconds between desired behavior and treat delivery.","Monica and Rachels, Phoebes baby shower, she is holding those leather pants, and isnt happy about it."
"House, she's not a dog. Rachel does it again, House presses the clicker one more time. It really seems to be working. Rachel eats a doodle. Does Cuddy know that Rachel's here, and that you're turning her into a schnauzer?",I told Marina that Rachel and I are working on a secret art project for mommy. Which means that some Peds Patient is about to be short one art project.,"Well, its possible that your dog became selfaware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanitys cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty."
The sacrifices we make for our Parkldren's education.,Who's a good girl? Who's a good girl?,Yet another child left behind.

Why are you putting hot sauce on a toy?,Maybe you don't care if Parkldren chew on your Caterpillar. I think it's wrong. What causes kidney dysfunction on top of Everything else?,"Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?"
"Arsenic poisoning. And people do change. Driscoll took it to heart when I asked him to think about Landon's history. He was much nicer, and then","Wow, two ideas that don't make any sense. If it was arsenic, they'd be puking and pooping. And conversations with moralizing strangers do not make people change their behavior.","Okay, lets open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this."

Our Patients are related. That can't be a coincidence. He stands up as he suddenly seems to have an epiphany about his own situation. I just had an idea.,Relevant to our case?,"Im fine, thanks."
Relevant to our case? No.,Sit.,But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
No. Sit.,Wegener's can be brought on by exposure to heavy metals. Did you see anything at the camp?,You hired your husband a hooker?
Seems like someone else in the camp would have had lead poisoning.,"You got anything better? Treat with cyclophosphamide. to Chase Go find your bliss. Chase leaves. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a play date. He leaves.",20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?

You're pumped 'cause your kid lied?,She's not my kid.,I cant believe it.
Tripped in my greenHouse. Growing my own organic veggies.,Didn't ask.,"It was traumatizing, Michael."
Sounds like you're real fond of that kid.,"You're really not good with nuance, are you?","No, I liked him."
Latest kidney function test shows no improvement.,Nice stitches. Do they hurt?,I dont know.
No. They gave me a shot of something.,That was Lidocaine. It triggered an underlying genetic condition called variegate porphyria.,No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
But I didn't have any Lidocaine.,"But you had a handful of antihistamines, courtesy of the deviant in the next bed. It's also a porphyria trigger.","But dont worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight."
"Wait, so we have the same genetic thing?",Yeah! small world. He gives a meaningful look at Driscoll and heads out.,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.

What about the macrocytic anemia?,"Borderline, which is the lab equivalent of imaginary, which, by the way, matches the rest of her medical history.",So much of this is just impossible to verify.
You really think she's psyParkng herself into atrial fibrillation?,So get her a cardiologist.,Its getting beautiful again.
quietly This is my mother.,smiling pleasantly Treadmill test went well no chest discomfort or ischemia.,"Excuse me. Oh, damn. Its my mother."
Aye! Not her fault. This Dean of Medicine stuff very impressive at parties. But she's forgotten how to be a real doctor. It's all in my file.,There are 15 years of clinic visits in this file.,"Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure."
I don't want to be a bother. But isn't this what you do for a living?,opening the file So!,Come on. Sorry to bother you.
It means we might have an actual case.,"Mexican herbal medication for stomach pRoblems, but only in the sense that lead chromate is an herb and poison is a medication.",Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later?

This other magic device her computer tells me that lead poisoning wouldn't cause all my symptoms.,True. But it could cause the 5% that are real.,Are you sure this things safe?
You think I'm a hypochondriac?,"Well, let me answer this way maybe you're imagining that I think you're a hypochondriac.","Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know youre having a little anxiety."
"Look, my hand just started to shake. It's a side effect of these arthritis pills. Read the label.","I did! when I was typing it up, right before I slapped it on a bottle of sugar pills.","Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!"
You printed a fake label! just to prove I'm a hypochondriac?,Did it work?,"No, it is a perfect smellalike."
"An hour to convince her to go with Dr. KaufMan, and only then because he runs internal medicine. She wanted to leave the hospital entirely.","My God, a Woman getting better wants to leave the hospital?","Seven minutes. Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. ."
"If she's getting better, it's not because you made her feel like a fool.","It couldn't be more because. If I hadn't, she'd have diagnosed herself with six new forms of cancer. She'd nEver leave.",All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
I'll be right there. to House A-fib's at 170.,Wait. I'm sorry she's sick. I'm not sorry I'm off the case.,Ill be there as soon as I can.
You're not off the case.,You don't think you can convince her,"So, were off."
"No, no. You are staying on. She just can't know about it.","Top of the morning, Dr. KaufMan. Here's the deal. You copy me","Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then well see if she wants to come back."
You copy me No.,I thought you spoke to Cuddy.,"SeeThreepio, do you copy?"
"Yeah. Then I spoke to the elder Cuddy, who specifically requested you not be involved.","Listen, Kauffy, you are perfectly competent, bordering on good, Even.","No. No, I didnt. I didnt want to be that guy."
You bugged the room?,"I absolutely, without apology, will admit that someone may have allegedly done so.","Oh, Im sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
Guess we can pass unethical and skip straight to illegal.,Not according to the recent Supreme Court case of bite versus me.,"Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical."
"If you want gloomy and unable to commit, then stick with the goyishe one.",This is completely unethical. Why are we listening to this?,"So Pheebs, pick one of them."
"I know I'm a pain, but it's impossible for me to work with you if you","Fine, fine! Instead of a live stream, I'll get a recap from Cuddy 20 minutes later thank you for saving America.","Well, I cant work with people who would do this."
"Anemia from taking over the marrow, a-fib from infiltrating cardiac muscle. Sounds good.",Yeah. I was really hoping for a different diagnosis one that KaufMan hadn't already come up with. He just started a bone-marrow biopsy.,"Look, you dont have to talk to it."
So we don't need to do anything.,I don't.,We dont have to.
"I don't. You do. Go to admitting. Find us a new case. House takes his backpack and goes to his office. As soon as Masters leaves, he leans back into the conference room and whispers to get the guys' attention. Whff! Psst, psst! Whaa! Phfffft!",DDX.,"Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room."
"Um, we just did it.","No, we just did the fake one.",We did it.
You think she's an alcoholic?,I had dinner with Arlene.,"Now, hold on."
We've got to run this by Cuddy.,nods Why do you think I'm in such a bad mood?,"Okay Joey, were luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?"
nods Why do you think I'm in such a bad mood? Alcoholic?,"Treatment's very easy, safe.",Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
I have to ask her about this.,Of course.,You really want to ask her that?
I don't think she'll lie to me.,She just spent the last five years going south of the border down Mexico way.,This is all of your things.
"We have our issues, but since Dad died, we tell each other the truth when asked directly. It's important to us.",Addicts lie.,"Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?"
"If something like that comes up again, just! do what you need to do.",And keep you out of it?,"Well, that is usually what I would do."
She spiked a fEver. It's 102.,That means I was wrong about the thiamine deficiency.,MEG was good for me but I dumped her.
You were wrong about the alcoholism.,True dat. It's actually looking more and more like leukemia.,"Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!"
KaufMan rushed the biopsies. It's not cancer.,So there's a bright side! KaufMan was wrong too.,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.
So there's a bright side! KaufMan was wrong too.,DDX.,Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.
Okay! What disease can turn Cuddy's mother into a coma Patient named Stewart?,Lupus? We got fired from that case. We're moving on.,"Uh, yeah, I got something."
We were already fired.,By the Patient.,Turns out they cant fire me.
You're not gonna talk to us?,Exactly. You're gonna have to Oops. He talked Hey! scoffs You're good.,"Hey, listen, I know you said that you didnt want to talk"
I'll do a blood draw and put glutethimide on the tox screen.,Really? You thought that case was interesting?,"Okay. Hey, dont try to lose too much money, all right?"
Aren't there other ways of keeping Masters occupied?,Not according to my sexual harassment seminar.,"There are other ways to serve, my prince."
"Maybe it's not hypochondria. She said she gets a lot of rashes. Add the fEver sounds like autoimmune, S.L.E.","Congratulations, you can think exactly like a semi-competent internist. KaufMan's starting her on prednisone. But the heart pRoblems were first.",How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
With no murmurs?,It's usually a late sign.,"Not so loud, but ideally, yes."
Echo showed pristine valves.,Below the resolving threshold.,All of the gold is safely through the gates of Kings Landing.
You got to tell him it's endocarditis.,Check the wiretap. His I.D. guy's been putting the same argument to him. He can't convince him. You think I got a better shot?,"Sursurprise him? Were not, were not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
So what do we do?,We switch her meds.,I have to talk to her about this.
This is nuts. This is way too compliCated.,loudly It's hanging an I.V. bag!,This is plenty complicated.
"louder If the attending doesn't know what she's on, the risk of drug reaction",louder still What risk? We know how he's treating her. We bugged the room.,All depends on the conference room meeting itself.
very loud This is not about information! We're talking ethical and legal violations on a scale that should make Even you puke!,shouting She's dying!,"You can say it as loudly as you want, but were not going to believe you."
You gonna run this by Cuddy?,No.,"All right, lets run it back."
"Timothy, we're gonna go see the doctor.",Another pop quiz.,What is it?
"Because I-I'm worried that he's switParkng your mother's medications. I checked with the pharmacy Dr. Chase got prednisone and antibiotics for my coma Patient, which wouldn't treat him, but could treat conditions that cause! heart failure.","You told me to keep you out of it, do what I needed to do. What the hell did you think that meant?",No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. Its not...
"I meant, like, if you had to slip her a few more vitamin pills or something. This is life-threatening! It's illegal. I wasn't expecting something like this.",Only because you intentionally weren't thinking about it 'cause you don't want to make any tough decisions.,Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
calmer Are you completely sure it's endocarditis?,That's not a real question. Endocarditis fits better than the alternatives. deep breath We're having a little trouble hanging the right I.V. The fastest way is with you help.,"Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do."
Allergy's got to be due to our antibiotics.,Does KaufMan know what we did? That's good.,Dont stand so still.
"No, that is terrible! He doesn't know that she got worse on antibiotics, so now he's thinking endocarditis. He'll put her back on the antibiotics that almost suffoCated her. What do we do?",We push through this. It started in the heart. Endocarditis still fits. It's just got to be fungal. We have to switch KaufMan's antibiotics for amphotericin B.,Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
I don't know if you're right. I don't care. But we are gonna end up killing this Woman if we keep confusing her attending with these secret meds.,I don't care about confusing the attending! I want this Woman,"I know! I know, she says its all massproduced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, shes gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?"
"We're not talking about simple antibiotics anymore. Amphotericin B is dangerous in itself. It's a poison. That's why it kills fungi. It'll give her fEver, Parklls","Which she already has, which will help us hide it.",You guys are really gonna do this?
I don't think I can take a risk like that.,"shouts Well, then you shouldn't have let her fire me! calmer Look, all you have to do is switch the I.V.s again.","Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention."
I'm so sorry I got you guys into this. You should go.,I'm right.,"No, no, you guys go."
"I agree. Fungal endocarditis fits. Cuddy and House are both reliEved. But we still have to tell your mother. Cuddy looks at her, disbelievingly. I don't want to tell her, not at all. But the Patient is the highest priority.",I'm kicking you out of your office.,When have I ever done that?
I've thought about that. Lying about me! won't work. Everybody knows your reputation. She's nervous but resolute. She punctuates her speech with little head nods as if to reassure herself that she agrees with what she's saying.,"True! but I won't have to lie. Buried in your coma Patient's big, big file is a form that doesn't allow treatment without the expressed consent of the relatives.",Sorry! Im justIm not very good at this! Im a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
"Buried in your coma Patient's big, big file is a form that doesn't allow treatment without the expressed consent of the relatives. Wait!",You drew blood. And that's not just a screw-up. It's a criminal assault.,"Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much."
But you told me,No. As you may recall! He mimes zipping his lip again.,Thats what you told me.
You set me up? long pause as she processes this Why?,"very quiet, very serious Because this Patient is the highest priority.",Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.
"I'm skipping the credentials committee. I'm going straight to the state board and reporting you for what you've done is so off the spectrum, I don't know there's a specific name for it.",to Masters I think he's talking to you.,"No no, no, wait, wait, wait Permission to join the Validity Committee."
I'll get the ambulance. leaves,to Masters Happy?,Ill call a cab.
I can't beliEve it. What just happened?,You just killed her.,What just happened?
"Are you blaming me? This is all because you're so arrogant, you goaded her into firing you!","Actually, my mistakes started a little after that, when I agreed to your brilliant scheme to keep me on the case after she'd fired me off it.","Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all."
She would have left the hospital.,"Only 'cause you would have let her, like you did just now.",She would have definitely slept with me.
You think I can control her?,I don't know. I've nEver seen you try.,You cant leave me alone with her.
I have been rebelling against this Woman my entire life.,Here's what I've seen.,Youre a part of the Rebel Alliance.
Are you taking this personally?,"She leaves, she dies.","Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally."
I feel a little dizzy.,Your heart's still weak from the infection. We'll hang an antifungal I.V. He starts getting the I.V. bag ready,"Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily."
That's what he told me.,"Two days ago? I said that I didn't have a department to run, I was being sarcastic.","Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
"No, you weren't.","Right, because people who are talking can't tell if they're being sarcastic.","Wow, it, its neat learning about submarines."
That doesn't make any sense. Of course they can. But you weren't.,I love A-Rod. He's soooo modest. And I highly respect the paintings he has of himself as a centaur. Question do I like A-Rod?,Im just saying that you cant be sure that is wasnt you.
She can't recognize sarcasm?,"Deficit in the right parahippocampal gyrus, which means CNS involvement before the fEver. puts the I.V. bag down I was wrong about the endocarditis.","No, shes right, and I just want you to know that from now on, Im gonna be much more sensitive."
Mom? Mom! Heart rate 170. Nurse! to House Do something.,I am.,"Ok mom, you know what, fine, Ill make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing."
I am. House!,"The fEver was hypothalamic. That means brain, heart, anemia, allergy. You hear that, what do you think?",Please dont be a space ship.
injecting something in Arlene's I.V. line I don't know.,You think heavy-metal toxicity.,"Okay. Whats it supposed to Oh, my God, this is so freaky!"
It can't be. You treated with chelation for lead.,"She got better, then she got worse. She nEver stopped being poisoned.","Oh, this sucks, Im switching back to Real Sex."
What are you doing?,You really want me to stop and explain?,Are you going to eat that bread?
The muscle's black. Necrosis?,Metallosis. Her artificial hip weared and teared way too much. It's cobalt poisoning. We need Chase to get an O.R. I'm gonna start chelation again.,Heart is. That makes a lot more sense. You think theyd help each other out like that at corporate? I think not!
Chris! you were a crappy husband! but you are a good person.,"Once again, you are unfired.",You are an amazing wife.

"You! You are my pRoblem. You are the most selfish, self-centered son of a bitch on the face of the planet. And I'm sick of it. I'm just! done.

"Which, by your definition, means it is.",We kiss plenty. Your turn.,Really? Define it.
Then what's the pRoblem?,Your turn.,"Yes, thats the problem."
What's the pRoblem?,"To the receptionist, sitting at a desk nearby. Excuse me. When exactly will the comMandant be back?",I dont get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.

"You're a pathetic loser, jerk! And I wouldn't kiss you if I had brain cancer and your lips were the cure!",She actually said that?,Arent you gonna give me a kiss?
"It doesn't matter. I clearly didn't lead him along or anything like that, which proves I'm not a tease. So why is your girlfriend mad at you?",I'm getting a kind of bossy vibe. I take it you're into that.,You made up a fake girlfriend to see if Id get jealous?
"Isn't that, like, sexual harassment?",Not if you're good-looking.,"Yes, it is harassment and Im going to be suing the winking face."
You said the one guy was short with a big nose.,Guess that's not the only thing that's big.,"Yeah, well, youre short."
It means he's lying! again.,Gets closer to one of the boys' face and screams. Because you can't handle the truth!,Its something he said to me the first night we met.

we do not use that word here. He did.,"Yeah, and I was talking about people like you.","I did not, not, not use those words."
That actually happened?,"Yes, it really happened.","Yeah, Im sure that happened."

So you really did force his roommate to hack into the laptop?,Why would I lie?,"Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine."
"It's your girlfriend's, isn't it?","She's not my girlfriend. I'm just interested in her because she's a client, and she sleeps above her covers four feet above her covers.",I gotta go find her.
So that's why she's so mad you looked through her computer?,"No, that part happened after she got mad. First she got mad. Then I stole her computer to fix things. And then we got the case.","Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain."

Yes.","Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you dont crash into geek mountain again."
No way. You didn't get her laptop by blowing down the door of her office. That's from Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.,Just seeing if you're still paying attention. It was actually more subtle.,"Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night."
Excuse me. But there are others here who would like a chance to speak.,Go right ahead.,I must be allowed to speak.
Go right ahead. No!,Audience is always right.,"No, no, no."
You poisoned a room full of Patients so you could steal your girlfriend's laptop?,I didn't poison anybody.,At the hands of your roommate?
Although it worked out just as well. They're morons.,Agreed.,Didnt work out well.
"No, not the Patients, the kids. It doesn't matter how you stole it. What matters is why.","You know, you're starting to remind me of someone.","Oh, I steal things all the time."
I didn't ask how you stole it. I asked why.,Holding the laptop. Isn't it obvious?,You stole it?
You think you can tell why she's mad by reading budget spreadsheets and per diem schedules?,I know why she's mad.,Shes always complaining about people at work.
Why is she mad?,"I was myself, which, by the way, she's supposed to love unconditionally.",Amys upset? Is it about me?
"Went to a blues club, we watched Cinderfella on DVD. And?","It doesn't matter. She's being unreasonable, and I have to fix it. I need to know what's really important to her. I need something big.","No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish."
I need something big. Because?,We're past that.,"Umm, oh, hey, I dont know."
Have you tried Parkldhood pet names?,I don't know her pets.,Did you try the petting zoo?
She's nEver mentioned a pet?,"Well, yeah, but I wasn't listening. She's not mad because I don't remember a dead dog's name.","OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?"
Just got a case from the E.R. Rutgers student came in with what looked like acute bronParktis. But there's nothing in his blood or sputum cultures.,Don't you think it's time you people stop looking to the white Man to solve all your pRoblems?,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
His O-2 sats are in the toilet. If we don't figure out what's attacking his,So figure it out! I'm busy.,I think hes taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.
That can't be true.,Why not?,"Oh, come on, that cant be true."
"'Cause if he was dying I mean, you're a doctor.",Patients die Every day. Not all of them are interesting.,"Will they throw their hats, you think?"
You still haven't answered either question.,She was mad because she's genetically programmed to make a big deal out of Every little thing.,"I dont know, you pretty much covered it."
"Actually, she's not like that.",Why are you sticking up for her? She says you're a pathetic jerk and she hates you.,"Well, she looks the exact opposite of that."
Really? Really.,Really?,"Oh really, OK."
"Hey. Uh, and no peck on the cheek. It has to be on the lips.",Winning a bet to force her to kiss you actually cuts against your theory that you know how she thinks.,Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
I wasn't forcing her to do anything that she didn't want to do.,You're hoping for a career in the NBA or the NFL?,"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we werent gonna do anything unless you were okay with it."
Not Even close to true. I just couldn't beliEve I'd lose.,"Ah, now we're getting somewhere.",Dont feel bad for me!
"No, we're not.","Oh, I thought we were.","Okay, okay."
"No, you thought we weren't, and that's exactly what you want, because you don't want to tell us why was she mad at you! You tell us you don't want to do your job because you're too busy trying to break into your girlfriend's laptop to figure out a way to make her not mad at you. But you don't tell us why she was mad at you.",It's stupid.,Are you crazy?
It's stupid. Talk.,I'm out of here. Unless!,Keep talking all you want.
Rachel's gonna be up soon.,"Well, you nEver know.",Now that Rachels gone?
"Yes, I do. Can you take the garbage out before you go?","Uh, I-I-I would, but! He points at his painful leg.","Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?"
"Oh, come on. It's not a lot.",Pain's always worst first thing in the morning.,Thats a little much.
That's so gross.,What's the big deal? It's not like she had a pRoblem swapping spit the night before.,Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
"Well, maybe it's not the swapping spit that bothers her, but the fact that you don't listen to her. Had she warned you not to do it?","Oh, I listen to her.","Oh, come on!"
But you just said before that you didn't.,"No, I said I didn't remember what she said.","And Im telling you, I dont."
"No, you said you don't listen","I listen to her. Okay? BeliEve me, I listen.",Really? Its okay if I listen with you?
"It's my toothbrush, and it's not just once. And it's not like I'd Even care, but you totally destroy it. You're supposed to brush with it, not gnaw on it like a rawhide bone.",I think Miss Four Cavities' time would be better spent copying Mr.,"Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums."
Would you please just use the toothbrush I bought you?,"Would you please just shut up and watch the movie? She turns her head to look at him. He meets her eyes. I said, please.","Okay. Well, for starters, theres nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder."
Why would you have to brush your teeth before you go to dinner?,You don't want to know! yet.,"In case you werent hungry now, but you got hungry later."
You're gross and dumb. You listen to what she says just so you can tell her how wrong she is.,You are clueless and naive.,"Well thats your opinion and its her opinion, but its not my opinion."
But not you.,I already kissed her. And I respect her enough not to treat her like some tender blossom who needs to be coddled.,Paaamolaaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
"No, I didn't punch her.",You're a moron.,I punched you.
I didn't mean to. The stick had wicked heel curve.,Did I mention you're a moron?,"Its a great stick, right?"
"Okay, you just said it's wrong to treat your girlfriend like she's weaker than you.",I'm not talking about trying to score. I'm talking about shooting high. Tennis shoes on a wooden floor? She obviously can't butterfly and cover the low corners.,I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.
"I must be in the midst of a complex partial seizure, 'cause I know you are not sitting at my desk.",Sorry. Ran out of lotion in mine.,"Oh, my desk is over."
Get the hell out of here.,Can't. This is the only place left that Cuddy'll nEver look for me. And I still haven't found what I'm looking for.,"Well, I should think so."
"Well, I can tell you, what you're about to find is my foot in your ass.",I don't think we've got enough lotion for that.,"Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass."
How did you Even get in here? The door was locked.,"Well, either I can walk through walls, or! We have liftoff.","Well, I think I can get through the door."
Is that Cuddy's journal?,"No, it's a freelance piece I'm writing for Teen Vogue. He closes it.","No, thats my potty training journal."
"No, no, no. Let me see that.","Sorry, got to go. He gets up.","No, show me."
Holding out his hand. Key.,"I got to give you one thing, Hourani. Your wife she's beautiful. I mean, wow.",I cant get the damned key out.
"So that's why you're here? Well, that was stupid.",I know. He answers his cellphone. Mr. Stupid-Head at your service.,Thats it? I thought thered be more of a reason why youre here.
Where are you now?,In the principal's office.,"Uhh, yes, I did, heres the dizzle."
"House, we don't have time for games. Pet scan was negative for sarcoidosis.",Great. Means the treatment's already working.,"Phoebe! Youre sick, you shouldnt play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there."
"It would if we'd actually started the treatment, but we didn't.",Why the hell not?,"We did, but there were extenuating circumstances."
"Because it's not sarcoidosis. If you were here, you would know that. He's dying. What's left of his lung is collapsing. F.N.A. of the mediastinal",I don't care about the F.N.A. What I care about is how he responds to the treatment.,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone!"
What I care about is how he responds to the treatment. House.,Just do it.,I dont care!
"Well, who cares? What did she write in her journal?",Thank you. That is exactly my point. Why does no one Ever beliEve me?,"Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary."
Why does no one Ever beliEve me? What?,Just because he's dying doesn't make it interesting.,Why do you hate me?
"You cheated on her, didn't you?","No, I didn't cheat on her.",You cheated on me.
It's obviously more than just you used her toothbrush and wouldn't take the garbage out.,"No, actually, it was exactly that.",Well dont you see how gross that is?
I just need some time alone.,Because I used your toothbrush?,I really need a moment alone with you.
And you wouldn't take out the garbage.,"That's insane. You know that, right?","Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would"
"You do whatEver you want, always.",I said I was sorry. I was I was still half asleep. I wasn't paying attention.,"Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do."
"And you're always right. And I don't mean you always think you're right. But y-you are actually always right, because that's all that matters.","That doesn't Even make sense. What, you want me to be wrong?",Youve always known what was right.
That's what I said. You don't listen to her.,You didn't say that.,"No, you werent listening."
"Yes, I did.","Well, I wasn't listening, then.","Any follow up, Amy?"
"But you found a way to fix things, right? That's why you were happy when you read her laptop.",I did. At least I thought I did.,"Well, we appear to have reached an impasse."
I did. At least I thought I did.,She recently got the thin envelope from her first choice preschool.,"Yes, I did, I did!"
What other school would he be talking about? Just finish the story.,"You know, I got to tell you there is bossy, which can be sexy. And then there's bitchy","Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didnt want him to think I was some stupid loser."
Finish the story.,"You obviously know this because you're on the school board, which puts you on the inside, and being the CEO here obviously connects you with Cuddy.","Uh Rach, if youre gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine."
"Well, if we're so connected, why isn't she the one asking?",Because she thinks it's wrong to use connections to cut in line. I don't.,"I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no selfrespecting man would ask a woman, So, where is this going?"
I might be able to help.,Fantastic.,"I can help out, if you need me."
Where are you?,I needed to take care of something.,Its hard to argue with his assessment.
It's not a foreign body. He is in the scan room with Masters. They are talking to House via speakerphone.,You must have missed it.,Howards bedroom. Howard is being massaged by the robot hand.
"If we do any more imaging, we're gonna have to add radiation poisoning to the DDX.",I meant the sarcoidosis.,Im worried about the New Horizons space probe.
We're gonna have to do a pneumonectomy .,"No sign of drug or alcohol abuse. He's not a smoker, a coal miner, or a potter it's sarcoidosis. Start him on corticosteroids and methotrexate.","Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!"
"If it's a drug-resistant bug, and we give him steroids","He'll die, which from the sound of it wouldn't be much worse. Suddenly House slams on his brakes! too late he's rear-ended the car in front of him. You moron.","Well, Im sure hell appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon."
But you have to show him your I.D. And your insurance stuff. You can't just give him a fake name.,"You don't have to do anything. Last time I checked, this was still America. Of course, that was ten years ago.",You know I dont have to do the paperwork unless youre actually dating.
"But you're gonna pay him, right? I mean, it was your fault.",A yellow light does not mean stop.,Then you cant afford to pay him anything.
"A yellow light does not mean stop. It was, at the most, 20% my fault. Since insurance companies automatically put 100% of the fault on the rear-ender, my little lie was actually an effort to aParkEve an outcome closer to the truth. And it would have worked, too, if it weren't for those meddling kids.",I am Dr. Hourani.,"Okay, look, they sent me the ticket."
Then why did you say the other doctor was Hourani?,"It's, uh it's a common name. It's like Smith! in Lebanon.",The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Standing up and walking toward House. Let me see your I.D.,"I told you, I left it in my other pants.","Now, how do you propose I get home?"
Really? 'Cause it looks like it's still in this pair.,Get your hands off me.,Thats still in there?
Give me your I.D.,"Hey, would you stop that?",Heres my I.
"Give me your I.D. Gentlemen, please.",What? What?,"And now you, two forms of ID, please."
"No, you wouldn't.",How do you know?,I know you would.
"You're right. It's just! I really like you. And I'm pretty sure you like me too. But I don't want to play any more games. When you want I mean, if you Ever want to, just tell me you're ready, and, you know! Sorry.",Well done.,"Oh, I see whats happening here."
but she's usually right. 05-15-1959,Thank you.,Shes right yknow.
"Dr. House, can I ask you a question? Are you insane or just stupid?",Is there a third option?,"Sheldon, dont take this the wrong way, but, youre insane."
Mm-hmm. And you think you can do that by getting someone to pull strings to get her daughter into our preschool. I spoke to Sanford Wells. They sit on either side of the principal's desk.,You can call the police. You can turn me in for lying at the accident.,You have everything she needs for day care?
"Oh, I'm sure Mr. Dryden has already taken care of that.","Let her daughter in. She's a great kid, and Dr. Cuddy is a great mom. They'll fit in perfectly here.",Oh youll probably take care of that on your hands.
"And how exactly does admitting her daughter prove how unselfish you are? Seems like you're still doing it to help yourself, not anyone else.",I don't know. I just know that I need to do something. I need her in my life. You know what it's like to actually need someone?,Youd hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you?
Dr. House! is there anything you'd like to say?,Can I be excused?,"Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, Ive always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see"
Can I be excused?,"It's just food. Something small enough to go down the wrong pipe, too big to get washed out by the bronParkal lavage.","Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. Ill make you some soy hot chocolate, and then Ill you tell you about our exciting new devilmaycare bathroom policy."
Wouldn't show up on a C.T.,But would cause the C.O.P.D. And wouldn't respond to steroids or antibiotics. Prep him for exploratory surgery and start the betting.,And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
Prep him for exploratory surgery and start the betting. Betting?,I got a hundred bucks says it's a pea.,Why would I gamble?
I got a hundred bucks says it's a pea. I'm busy.,I know. He closes the door. I just want to say that I'm sorry.,"Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didnt I?"
Shouldn't you be saying that to Sanford Wells? A fifth-grade career day? You really thought you could pull that off?,"I figured, how hard could it be?","Hes right. And given that youre probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, Im sure you do suck."
Is that why you also stole my computer?,"Yes, it is.","Great, they stole my laptop."
And then threw it in the trash?,"I did not throw it, I placed it, knowing that the janitor would find it and know it was yours and return it to you unharmed.","So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?"
So what were you an Astronaut or a Bullfighter?,I was myself!,And now youre also an astronaut.
House. House turns around. You want to come over for dinner tonight?,I'd love to.,Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
"House! The elevator door close in front of her, she takes the other one. When she gets out of it, people are leaving the first one, which looks empty. She walks away, looking annoyed, then smiles, turns back and slips in the elevator where House is hiding, stuck to the wall. I assume you're avoiding me because of the charity gala.",This Friday? It's completely slipped my mind.,Pennys apartment. Penny is on the phone.
So you'll be there?,"No, I meant it slipped my mind to tell you I'm not going.","Oh, but I wont be there."
What do you think it'll look like if you don't show up when I get an award?,"Like I don't give a crap about awards, charities, what it looks like.",What am I going to do with the award?
If you Ever want!,I RSVPed two days ago.,If you want.
"If you were already going, why did you!",Foreplay. The elevator door close. They both smile.,"Well, then why are you going?"
Looking for a tie. What's the big deal?,"Obviously, he wants you out of the closet for some reason.","Wait, what does that mean?"
"He's lying. House waits for more. He's not an executive. I saw his hands. They're covered with calluses and little cuts. He works with them. A lot. The men look at her, speechless.",Hmm. Baby steps. Go down there and do it.,"Hillarys apartmen,. Hillary and Ross are having dinner. He is avoiding opening his mouth."
But what if I'm wrong? I'll just end up offending him.,"Consider that part a bonus. She seems unsure. All right, I'll send along one of your big brothers to help. You want scary, smarmy, or shorty?","Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, Ill try it."
Place has been cleaned and sanitized by our Patient. We sent for the autopsy report! pRobably take a week to get it.,"When he's not working, where does he go all day to hide out?",Great! Lets get some food. Im starving.
His old real estate office?,"Treat for bacterial infection. Meantime! Bert, take Ernie and check his office for environmentals. I'll talk to Cuddy about getting the autopsy results faster. He leaves.","Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell."
You're really going to the charity gala?,Why? I wanna do something nice for my girlfriend.,"Wait, what? Youre going to the fundraiser tonight? Thats going to be weird."
You nEver do anything unless it stands to benefit you.,"I realize that three failed marriages can leave a Man twisted and bitter inside, but in a good relationship, people sometimes do things for each other.","Im going to try to be confident, but not cocky."
She! she didn't! Giving up 300. She really wants you there.,Why do people beliEve I'm incapable of doing anything nice?,"Shes right, you shouldnt have bought tickets just for us ."
Maybe we're thinking too far outside the box here. Just because he could have picked up any one of a hundred exotic diseases from his job doesn't mean he didn't.,"Taub's life partner has a point. Started treatment with antibiotics, and he got worse. Simple answer begins with m ends with mia.",Warm milk and Excedrin P.
Simple answer begins with m ends with mia. Meningococcemia?,"That works too. Confirm with a lumbar puncture. And on the off chance we're wrong, find out what else he's been lying about besides his job and his drug use.",I dont know what else we can do here.
How'd that work out? Not well.,I need some intel on this charity Event on Friday night.,How did that work out?
Show up and behave. PRoblem solved.,Your pRoblem solved. Don't you think she deserves more than a plaque and a round of applause for 15 years of running this dump?,"Mike knows Im coming, and if I dont show up hell think its because of him!"
"It's a watch, not a plaque.","It's a clich. I want to make things more exciting, something she'll remember for more than ten minutes.","Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this."
"In rare cases, a tick or a spider bite could set it off!",Show of hands. Who's going to this charity thing Friday night? Chase and Taub rise hands.,Fine! But please God tell me how to stop them from going off!
Already got a date.,"Cuddy is getting an award. I think we should all be there, show our support.",Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
"I assume you're planning on screwing it up, so you want to maximize witnesses.",Why does Everyone go to that?,In case it happens.
Why does Everyone go to that? Experience?,Shut up!,Who goes there?
"I! I, uh, better go check on him. He tries to leave with dignity, but has to run out. House smiles.","Swollen joints, high white count, fEver. Conjunctivitis. Anyone?",Im gonna go get him!
"Well, we would have seen it in his blood work. Unless the saline used to recover and store the tissue samples has been shown in recent studies!",Get new blood and CSF samples using formaldehyde instead of saline. And start him and his wife on triple antifungal therapy.,But you dont even understand its symbolism.
And start him and his wife on triple antifungal therapy. His wife?,"Well, if he's really trying to keep her happy, I assume they've shared bodily fluids. They leave the room, leaving Taub and Foreman, still in their stalls, alone.","Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellies pay a hundred dollars. Angela?"
Hey! House whistles. The music stops.,Huh?,"Oh, you know what that is!"
What are you doing?,What's it look like I'm doing? Auditioning a band for Friday night.,"Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard theyre either having sex or Howards caught in a milking machine."
"I think, if you do this, your Evening will end with you in your apartment alone! with a sock.","Muchachos, adelante. Tres, cuatro! The music starts back, with House conducting it.","Sheldon, Ive hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment."
Except it's nEver been documented to cause hearing loss. Ever.,"Oh, no, she di'int!",But you didnt hear what it was.
"This isn't the classroom. In the real world, real doctors know that Patients can have more than one thing wrong with them.",Zing.,Yeah! Lets do it!
You have a better idea?,I do.,Well I have an idea.
Or a viral infection that's reached his brain.,I say we go with Ernie on this one. Get an MRI. Find it.,Okay! Well need a sixpack of Zima.
"What do you want us to do, House?","If it's a tumor, we start chemo. Bombard his head with radiation.",Youve been wondering why youre here.
"And without an MRI, we don't Even know if he has one.","He's definitely dead if we do nothing. If I'm wrong, all we do is shave a few hours off.","All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on."
We'll need his wife's consent.,Masters will get it.,Unless we can all agree to some ground rules.
"Uh, he's right.","No, he's not. Consider this me officially booting you out of the nest.","Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, Im dating you."
"I didn't mean any of those awful things I said. I'm so sorry. I love you, Bert. I've always loved you. I also kept a secret from you. I was gonna tell you at the restaurant! but you got sick. And I wanted to wait until you felt better. I'm pregnant, sweetheart. You're gonna be a daddy.",Why rash again?,"Oh, great, now youre gonna get emotional."
Two hours before the rash came back. They're not connected.,What was he doing two hours before he broke out the first time?,"Theyre still, theyre still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!"
Crime scene and an MRI. Still not seeing the connection.,We've been missing connections this entire case. Did he say anything? Did he show any signs of stress in the MRI room?,I left this shit city because I didnt want to die in it.
"He said he was cold, but it's always freezing in there.",Cold and rash.,"Uh, listen Phoebs, I know youre not goin in there but do you think itd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom?"
Muckle-Wells syndrome? There's only been a couple thousand documented cases in the U.S.,"Well, now there's a couple thousand and one.","The Movie Set, Joey is reporting for work."
It is dark and rainy outside. You okay?,Why wouldn't I be? Solved my case.,Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
I just came to apologize. You're right. I am turning bitter and cynical inside.,You're finally putting the cat down. Wilson glares at House. House gives up. She loves mariaPark. I told you.,"Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasnt mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart."
We've got 15 minutes to get there if we wanna see the board freak when House's mariaPark band marches in.,"All of them are gone, Wilson. They're all dead because I am screwed up.","Yeah, I should go to, cause Im playing in one hour."
You lost one Patient. And it wasn't your fault.,"What about that mom who gave her baby cancer? If I'd figured that one out quicker, she'd still be a mom alive.",It was over a bowling alley.
She refused treatment when it was offered. How is that your fault?,And there was that guy I spent a day trapped in isolation with. He was five feet away the whole time. Just watched him die like an idiot.,"So, as Joeys friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?"
"Yeah. You've lost Patients before, and you'll lose Patients again. Why!",Exactly! Why? Because love and happiness are! nothing but distractions. The only thing my relationship with Cuddy has done for me is make me a worse doctor.,"Anyway, Im going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translators date?"
Right. The great Dr. House doesn't deserve to be happy. You know it's not true.,My happiness is being paid for by other people's lives. Softly How is she?,"If youre not happy, why dont you just let Kripke have the office?"
"First! first, you're not driving anywhere. And second, you are definitely not talking to Cuddy like this.","Okay. I'm gonna walk. He leaves the pub, limping and stumbling at the same time. Wilson stays at the counter, watches him go and sighs.","No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else."
"Okay. I'm gonna walk. He leaves the pub, limping and stumbling at the same time. Wilson stays at the counter, watches him go and sighs.","We really, really need to talk.",Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?
"House? House? She gets out of bed and takes a few steps toward the bathroom, stretParkng and trying to wake up. A hand comes out from under the bed and grabs her ankle. Oh! My God! What the hell?",Muahahahaaaaahhh His head pops out from under the bed. He is grinning. Gotcha.,"Rosss apartment, Rachel is just entering."
Did you actually wake up early and hide under the bed just to scare the crap outta me?,Set an alarm and Everything.,And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
It's like dating a ten-year-old.,"God, I hope not. She smiles and joins him on the floor, draping across his chest as they kiss. Now that we're down here!","Well, if you havent noticed, Ive been between them for the last ten years."
Hold that thought. She gets up.,Seriously?,Up she goes!

Imaging showed no sign of upper GI issues. But the kid did admit to being depressed and to smoking pot to take the edge off.,"You are very pleased with yourself, aren't you?",This stuff is great!
"His marijuana could be laced with formaldehyde or lead, which could cause a pulmonary hemorrhage which could make him spit up blood. House waits. Yes. Yes, I am. I thought it was a good catch.",to Taub Run a lead lEvel and push 5 liters IV fluid.,I bet this guy didnt leave his weed in the car.
Feel free to tip your other server.,Cystoscopy was clean. Cytopathology was normal.,"Well, yknow, I never know how much to tip."
Why do you have my lab results?,"tosses them on the desk I don't. If I did, I'd know you were fine.",Im gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska.
Unless the blood came from my kidneys.,"Come on. Your hypochondriac mom had a brush with mortality last month, and it's understandable that you're worrying more than usual, worrying that you might turn into her.",That was close enough.
"You're right. Odds are, this is nothing.",Meet me in the cafeteria in ten. There'll be a corn dog with your name on it. I mean an actual corn dog. They fixed the deep fryer.,"Uh, Michael, he wasnt inferring, he was implying."

You don't think,Not talking to you!,I dont think tho.
Everything okay with Cuddy?,She's fine. She's just too stupid to accept it. Start him on nafcillin for staph.,"A Dry Cleaners, Joey is there with Phoebe and is trying to get his picture put back amongst the other celebrities hanging on the walls."
"All that's in the, uh, First Mutual safety deposit box. The retirement accounts",You're freaking out because of one ultrasound performed by an incompetent Bonobo monkey.,What do you have a safe deposit box for?
As demonstrated by my sitting here calmly going about my business.,"shrill Calling a Lawyer, drafting a will!",I am calm.
"I'm a single mom. I need to set up a trust, appoint a guardian. It's silly that I haven't done it before now.",But you're doing it now because you think you're sick. The freaking out can at least wait until after the biopsy this afternoon.,"Well sure, if you say youre gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you."
The biopsy's not till tomorrow. It's the first opening in the schedule.,"For the Dean of Medicine, the first opening in the schedule is!","After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a twozero margin."

Are either of you this girl's father?,Nope.,So are you his mother or his father?
coming from the bathroom I'm not sure. I think I just peed blood.,Looks like peeing blood is the new black.,Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
"Scoping showed no sign of a bleed in his bladder, which points to a kidney pRoblem.",PRobably some kinda mass.,"Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you."
"Kidney mass wouldn't explain the coughing blood or the hemorrhages. Antiphospholipid syndrome, on the other hand!",Makes sense. But doesn't rule out a mass.,MMM MMM MM MM MM!
You think it's cancer?,Mass doesn't have to be cancer. Could be renal hematoma.,"I think... I mean, I dont know what it is but..."
Cuddy has a mass on her kidney?,It's pRobably just a complex cyst or angiomyolipoma.,"So, youre origin is what?"
And then you pointed out how sweet that was.,"If it were heroin, he'd be going through withdrawal. Antiphospholipid syndrome's a better fit. Start the Patient on plasmapheresis.","Oh, you have to say that, youre sweet on me."
"While he's doing that, can I at least search his House for drugs?",Have I Ever said no to that question?,Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans.
Have I Ever said no to that question?,What are you doing here?,How many times have I asked you not to do that?
What are you doing here? Pie-eating contest.,Cuddy's biopsy is in an hour. You should be keeping her company.,"Actually its not pies, its just pie."

You know what's good for that? Practice. Doing it I don't know once?,I'm not gonna act like there's a crisis before we know there is one. There's no proof there's anything wrong with her.,"Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition."

Look at this.,Chase? How'd it go with Cuddy? Chase?,Listen to this.
Chase? Aah!,Good thing I brought my ax cane.,"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! Theres a highspeed car chase on!"
from somewhere nearby House! help me!,I'm coming!,Please. Im desperate.
I'm coming! House! please!,It looks like we got company.,Im coming! Im coming!
House! House turns and tries to loCate the sound of her voice. Aah! aah!,shouting No!,"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!"
aah! shouting No!,Ah!,"Oh nononono, no!"
Are you okay?,I was sleeping. What could go wrong?,"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work."
"So what causes bleeding, kidney pRoblems, and unilateral numbness?",And a complete absence of any record of Cuddy's kidney biopsy. She must have put it under a false name so I couldn't rush the results.,You could be a little more into it.
"What if we had it backwards and it's not a bleeding pRoblem, it's a clotting pRoblem?",There's no Patient file created in the last two days for anyone having that procedure.,"Well, they may be a handful, but theyre so cute."
She backdated the file? That's very clEver.,Hands off. She's mine.,She never sent it to you?
House. House looks at him. We're worried too.,How sweet. I'm not worried. I just wanna get the results so she can stop worrying.,Stuart. Hes been living with us for a while now. Im sure hed love to get us out of his hair.
"Okay, but in the meantime",Do an angiogram. You two go to pathology and look at Cuddy's slides.,Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
You just said you didn't know which sample was hers.,I guess you're gonna have to look at them all.,"I know you didnt, I was talking about Monica."
What are you doing?,Pie-eating contest.,I dont think it does that.
"I was going to send Chase to tell you what the obvious right thing to do here is, but then I realized! if you were too stupid to know how stupid that was, you might miss the irony. You have to be with her.",Yeah. I get it. She needs artificial support for an artificial pRoblem. She's fine.,Go get your ride and take her back to base.
She doesn't sleep with Chase.,We don't know that. Masters knocks on the open door and enters. Hey! Eating pie in here.,"Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack."
House! I'm not gonna tell you a third time. Do not screw this up. Because I really don't wanna clean up the mess. He leaves.,He's referring to the pie.,"Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, No."
"Fourteen Patients with kidney biopsies. I tabulated them against their urinalysis results. Six men, three diabetics, one LCDD, one kid, two seniors, and by default, one! Cuddy. She waits for the praise that isn't coming. She approaches him with the file. Uh! the biopsy was inconclusive. The mass is near the center of her kidney. They couldn't get a readable sample.",Means they'll have to remove the mass to know if it's cancer or not.,Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
"The file says they're doing some imaging now, give the surgeon a better idea of what he's dealing with.",calling from the living room Can we order pizza? There's nothing in the fridge. At least not anymore. What's happening with the Patient?,"Dwight, I really think someones probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it."

Although! maybe we should have just played a few rounds of Savagescape 2 The REvenge, because that's obviously the best way to make someone feel better.","You keep talking like Wilson, your face will freeze like that.","Well, you know, theres no one way really, its just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, Im over you."

Pot roast is ready. Smells wonderful!,"I cured all my Patients, so I came home to spend time with Rachel.",Can I make just a little announcement.

What about the fries?,Hot and salty and delicious. He pulls a candy bar out of his pocket and starts to eat it. She stares at it. Talking about food made me hungry.,"I just dont understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries."
You had candy in my other dreams.,Means you're stressed at work. All dream symbols mean you're stressed at work. Or castration anxiety.,Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
No. I was hoping! She puts his gun in his hand you'd figure out a way to handle all this. Maybe you can't because you're still a Parkld.,"I can do better. They push themselves to stand, leaning against the wall.",With a woman you were chasing through a park?
House! Ah!,I should have been here. Sorry.,Im not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.

Me! House.,Your tumor was benign. An oncocytoma. They cut it out. You'll be fine.,"I like the musical Grease, or as we call it, home."
Then what was in my lungs?,"Once they ruled out cancer, I remembered that your mom was allergic to antibiotics.",We should really learn how to play the real way.
"Ugh! Wait. She takes it and studies it intently. There are so Many things that I could be afraid of, and most of the time, I Manage to! lock them up behind doors. But this happens! all those doors just burst open. House gets a far-away look. You just figured something out about your Patient, didn't you? Her smile is both indulgent and proud. Go. Do what you do.",Take him off the meds. He's got a staph infection.,"You see, the danger was that I might under or overreciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan."
You treated him for staph three days ago. It didn't work.,"Bacteria already in his system responded. But once a door's been busted open, more just keep coming.","Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother."
I got that.,"For the cheap seats, an abscess is a gooey little cream puff of infection. PRobably burst when your little pride and homicidal joy took a hard foul.","Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her email address."

How did you know?,"and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and look, Andy, it doesnt matter."
How did I not know? How did I make myself forget for months that you're an addict? My subconscious was trying to tell me you could nEver get through this without drugs.,It was a one-time thing.,"Oh, Im sorry."
"It's not about the pills, House. It's about what they mean.",I was scared because I thought my girlfriend might die.,I guess this could count as an adventure.
"No. You don't take Vicodin because you're scared. You take it so you won't feel pain. Everything you've Ever done is to avoid pain drugs, sarcasm! Keeping Everybody at arm's length so no one can hurt you.",As opposed to Everyone else in the world who goes looking for pain like it's buried treasure?,Does it give you joy to scare people?

You know, Amy, sometimes when youre in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt."
"But you weren't with me, not really.",I wanted to be.,"Yes, but what you didnt realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense."
That's not enough.,imploring I can do better.,Its not enough!
"I don't think you can. They stare at each other. You'll choose yourself over Everybody else over and over again, because that's just who you are. I'm sorry.","No. No, no, no. Don't. Don't.","Okay, well, stop staring at them."

I was about to ask you the same thing.,I'm fine.,"Yes, thats what I was going to ask, thank you."
Okay. following House into the hotel room and closing the door,I assume Cuddy told you that she dumped me.,"Well, you dont know that."
I assume Cuddy told you that she dumped me. She did.,And that I'm back on Vicodin.,"I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me."
She told me you had taken a Vicodin.,And then I took a lot more. He takes another one. And so on.,"We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didnt already know, and I came home."
But you're fine?,"Well, I'm not fine as in fine, but I'm fine as in you don't have to worry about me.","No, I dont think I ever did."
"Because you cleared out your bank account, checked into a hotel, and started back on Vicodin?",Because I'm going to be fine as in fine very soon.,Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
"Until that happens, are you sure Vicodin is the!",My leg hurts.,"Well, honey, its not gonna do itself."
You've been able to handle the pain.,It's gotten worse.,This has been a really tough time.
Not physically worse.,Worse is worse.,I was wrong.
So you don't want to just avoid the issue. You want to avoid avoiding the issue. Sorry.,Nothing is either as bad or as good as we think it is at the time.,This is an interesting way to stay out of it.

Okay. This might not be such a bad idea.,What do you think he meant by anything?,Maybe this isnt a good idea.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.,"I know it's a figure of speech, to underline the anything.","I cant relax about it, you know?"
Maybe talk to someone?,Already scheduled.,"Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?"

We weren't avoiding you. It took us a little time to think up a diagnostic test no one's Ever thought up before.,Apology accepted.,We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
Foreman starts to talk but Chase interrupts. It could be a tumor in a salivary gland. We should get a parotid biopsy.,"indulgently Oh, that's so cute. You're fighting over who's in charge.","Im sorry, Im with a client right now."

"House, as long as you're not here, someone has to have the final!",Let me rephrase. Who's your daddy?,"Okay, this is the match that decides it all."
"Let me rephrase. You have to decide if you're gonna buck up, get out of bed, and do your job, or if you're gonna wallow in self-pity.",Those my only two choices?,"But if I dont come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
That is not true in so Many ways.,"And, Chase, stop screwing with Foreman.",That is so not true.
"Wait, House, should we be more worried about you? Are you on Vicodin? Because if you are, you pRobably shouldn't be ordering procedures.",I am not on Vicodin. He swallows a Vicodin. Do the tests.

I'm trying to be a friend.,At least I have the good sense not to marry Every Woman I fall into bed with. Maybe you should move in with me.,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I justI just screwed up!"

His E.E.G. didn't show any sign of seizure activity.,I didn't say it was a seizure. I said it was something like a seizure.,"Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in."
And I'm guessing you're about to tell us we need to find something like an E.E.G. to prove!,"Nope, 'cause I already got one. Stands and takes a wad of bills out of his pocket, which he hands to Hooker 6.","Nice? They were nice. I mean, thats it? I mean, mittens are nice."

"House, there's no infection in this guy's brain. CT's clean.","Well, that sucks. Now we have to blow up his heart.","Okay, Im glad youre not here?"

"You're right. I am. But my damaged, depressed, drug-addled judgment is still better than yours or any other doctor in this hospital, and my team is gonna do this procedure and save his life.

"It wasn't! You know, I've had a pretty rough year. Do you think maybe we could just give this whole thing a rest?",You killed a Man! But you pled out to drugs. Hit-and-run under the influence. Guy you kneed in the groin was your date who dropped a dime on you.,"Well, maybe. But Im still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you."
How do they not have 1/2-inch drill bits?,"By the way, Harold's pRobably gonna hit on you. Everything I have, he wants. Just turn him down flat. Unless!","Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princesscut drill bit."

How's this thing Judged?,"Hang time, distance, and accuracy.","Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous."

Not Everything means something. We're gonna be up soon. I want to check the pressure. She picks up the gun and walks away.,You don't wake up in the middle of the night to cry over a dead stranger.,"All right. Well, dont worry, I call shotgun!"
You don't wake up in the middle of the night to cry over a dead stranger. You don't confess to killing a Man and then hide the details unless the details rEveal more about you than the crime itself. pause You pled down to drugs. You've got a horrible genetic disease and a sibling who's suddenly on your mind.,You euthanized your brother. And that guy back at the House was the doctor who wouldn't help you cover it up.,"Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You cant die yet. You havent confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order?

"Can I talk? She said they nEver had kids, and you all jumped to infertility. You nEver considered the other option.",And the bitch is back. They both smile.,"Look, its obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution."
there's something seriously wrong with us. I know.,"Home, sweet home.",What is the matter with us?
"Home, sweet home.",You owe me 87 bucks for gas.,Theres only one place we can go.
You owe me 87 bucks for gas.,I'll kill you.,Maybe we shouldnt pay our gas bill?
I'll kill you.,"When the time comes, if you want me to.",You will have to kill me too.
"When the time comes, if you want me to.",I'll do it now if you like. looking behind him. I think I've got a baseball bat in the back.,"Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. Oh my God."
What the hell happened to you? Why'd you lie about going to Rome?,"loudly, from his office You'd lie too if you bottomed out, ended up in! drug rehab. He takes some pills.","Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so Ill be just as pathetic as the rest of you."
I didn't Even know you had a pRoblem.,"Loved ones are always the last to know. Loved ones and Robotic, estranged ex-boyfriends. Our Patient is Kendall Pearson. 16-year-old aspiring pirate.",No wait! Theres only a problem when I look at you. Oh I got it! I got it.
She's that Canadian kid who's trying to be the youngest person to sail around the world.,Collapsed yesterday during a practice run.,I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
"Uh, last day as a student. Could be simple dehydration. She told the Coast Guard she had felt dizzy.",Pulse and BP were normal at the time of the rescue. It's not dehydration. What about your internship? You sign up this morning?,"Im on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders Ive found ever since."
"But what about her back? Look. He replays part of the DVD Right before the collapse, she hit the small of her back on the railing. Damaged adrenal glands caused adrenal insufficiencies, which caused the collapse.",Nice.,"Yes, she jumped right back up."
What's with the sudden interest in her future?,"Sighs You know, a blacksmith who spends this much time hammering out a new blade from raw Jell-O! gets curious about who ends up wielding it.","Look, all shes saying is we are in love so it doesnt matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now."
"Before I make my decision, I still have one more LP I need to get. So I'd like to go to the E.R.","Thirteen, why don't you take Masters to do the blood draws. You can remind her about all the perks of working for me.","Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help."
"Rehab? Great cover story. Now I can't Ever drink around those guys again, thus eliminating my main bond with Chase.",Save the attitude for someone who didn't just get you your medical license back. Price you pay.,At least they talked about you on Letterman.
There's a Parkcken in your office.,"No, there isn't.","Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrels office."
"You lied about rehab? Oh, great.","Relax. She's completely honest, but also completely boring. Watch this. Don't tell anyone.","OK. Lets get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. Im working the steps. Im on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. Im here to make amends. Ive been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I dont need you to accept my apology, but Id love it if you did."
Of course not. Thirteen leaves. Masters looks into the Patient bay. You did an LP? Why didn't you page me?,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to do one of those? You should've spoken up. You want the job or not?",No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I dont suppose you need much room.
"Um, I! after careful consideration, I have decided to accept your offer for an internship.",Great. My department has a slightly different procedure log.,"So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty."
"Uh, you forged the last one. I only did nine LPs.",Do you know how to do an LP?,"Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?"
Do you know how to do an LP? Of course.,Do you know how to do nine LPs and say it was ten?,If youre compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.
You knew he had a Parkcken? How come?,Down here! House is by the elevators. He's looking at the floor and taking baby steps. Loss of consciousness plus she's slowly turning blue. Can we rule out magical gum?,He is? Shouldnt it be he was? You said you put three arrows in him.
"Uh, why are you putting, um, Parkcken footprints on the floor?",That clEver bastard Wilson got a hold of an Australorp.,"Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?"
That clEver bastard Wilson got a hold of an Australorp. Ah.,Hello? The quietest and calmest of all the Parkckens.,I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
But not the loss of consciousness. Cerebral vasospasm explains both.,Cerebral vasospasm makes sense.,Get in there!
"Um, I, um, been busy with my Patient.",You're not busy now. Standoff. She leaves. Bawwwwwwk bawk.,"Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff."
I handed in my log.,"On your way to do that, did you happen to stop and give Thirteen an LP? Thirteen's stiff gate, small pupils, and the raging headache she's hiding gave you away.","Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight."
Yes. And I still broke a rule.,My rule. Told you to defy the Man. Not this Man.,"Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?"
Can we go?,No. Not liking it is fine. Not doing what you don't like makes you an eight-year-old. Wastes your potential. He sits at his computer and starts typing.,"Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at."
You want me to be like you. It's not going to happen.,That's the last thing I want. 'Cause then neither one of us would be exceptional.,Come on. I dont wanna do that. I wanna be
You think I'm exceptional?,Not anymore.,I think youre amazing.
I can do my job without compromising.,"No, you can't. 'Cause I'm not gonna let you. Internship's gone. It's time for Masters to say good-bye. Enjoy being a surgeon. You'll be fine.",Worstcase scenario were back to running.

I took a break. I told them I had to pee.,You lied. Small one. But it's a gateway lie.,Go to the bathroom.
I care about the Patient.,Another lie. You care about being exceptional.,Thanks again for your help.
I told her dad I was gonna take care of her.,A third lie. Welcome to the slippery slope.,I told her around seven.
Add that to a calcified pineal gland.,"When is a calcified pineal gland not a calcified pineal gland? I realize, technically, it's nEver, but","Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice thats been predigested by a fungus?"
Yes. But the calcified pineal could be sarcoidosis.,You had me at I had to pee.,Hey. I thought you werent supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after youve had a crown put in.
I'm not back! I'll just be staying for this case.,You got really good at this lying thing.,I can come back.
"Like, literally skin you and wear you as a disguise. Oh!",You want yours extra crispy or original recipe?,Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?
I'd rather have it be with. I'm stuck.,"No, you're not.",For you or with you?
No one will stop Kendall's sail. You need to step in.,reeling the lure back in Sign on the door says I'm a diagnostician. Cool diagnosis means I'm finished.,"Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want."
She could die.,casting off again Pretty sure the law of the land states that Everyone has the right to be an idiot.,Shalom. Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nineminute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month.
"You are constantly railing against hypocrisy, forcing people to face the truth. This time nothing?",reeling the lure in Yeah. 'Cause they faced the truth.,The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it.
And made a decision that will in all likelihood kill their daughter.,I'm fine with that. I wanted a diagnosis. I got it. What do you want?,Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!
I don't want her to die.,Break the rules.,"My God, you cant even look at me!"
Break the rules. I can't.,So coloring inside the lines is more important to you than saving this girl's life?,No need. Im breaking rules all the time.
Depends on who you ask.,"unseen, from the hallway Fetch!",Well thats debatable.
"Dr. Masters, thank you.",Someone has got their pouty face on.,"My pleasure, Mrs."
I did things no doctor in their right mind would do.,Good.,"Ive done a lot, havent I?"
"I Manipulated, lied, forged, stole.",I don't want to know the specifics. Might be called to testify.,I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... presidents son. And held him for ransom.
I broke the rules because I beliEved I was right.,You were right.,"Oh, come on."
"Then why don't I feel good or satisfied? Instead, I just feel like throwing up.",And you're following me to ask how I break the rules and maintain my rosy demeanor.,"Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it."
I didn't do it to be happy. I just thought I would be.,"Well, you can't always get what you want. Wilson opens the door and House hands him a twenty. To the victor of the spoils. Your bird recover okay?","Well, Im just glad to know youre happy because you know I felt bad."
House. I can't do it. I'm leaving.,Surgery?,"Divorce. Um... OK, Meredith is so old..."
I! don't know what I'm going to do. But I do know I don't want to be here.,Nothing will Ever be simple again.,Youre not staying here?

He makes coffee.","Coo, again. Dont blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her."
He just won $42 million in the state lottery. I think I read about this lucky bastard in the paper.,You sure you don't mean the lucky bastard whose grandkids snorted his winnings till he drank himself to death with drain cleaner?,"Yeahyeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000."
"Sure, some people will screw up anything, but some won't. That kind of cash, he has a chance to turn a miserable life around.",Miserable stays miserable. Happy doesn't buy lottery tickets in the first place.,Hes always been terrible with money.
Our lEvel of happiness is set. It's in our DNA. No cash payout's gonna change that.,It's like there's two of me.,"I mean, what if we did that?"
My mother's Lawyer called. She's threatening to sue the hospital over our mistreatment of her. Says it slowed her recovery.,"You know,I was just thinking how much I want a relationship with no sex, but where I still have to deal with your mother.","With Jon in the capital, youll be the true power in the North."
"My mom and I got into a fight. Because of our replacement hip replacement, she can barely get around her own House. I told her she has to live with me while she recovers.","Oh, I'm starting to get the connection. Yeah, she has a House, my name is House.","But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?"
"You're the doctor that treated her, that illegally switched her meds after she fired you, that went behind the back of her actual doctor.",Those beads from Thailand. Cuddy gives him a non-understanding look If we're listing all the things that you pressured me into.,"Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office."
"The point is you're the one who's on the line here, whose name is on her hospital records.",Whose name is on her name?,And shes saying whats important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
Treatment for both is chelation.,"Great work. Alkalinize his urine and force diuresis for heavy metal poisoning. If that doesn't work, put him on dialysis for toxic inhalation.",Seal it off with drywall so you dont hear YoYo Ma over there all the time.
I just said treatment for both is chelation.,And I said force diuresis and try dialysis. You need a transcript?,Just reiterating what you said to me.
"Whoa, whoa. Settle down.","If we chelate, we're not gonna know what disease he had, which means we're not gonna know if the pRoblem was in his lousy old job or his still-lousy new life.",To take the castle.
She won't let us make a move until you agree to a sit-down with the godmother and her consigliere.,Bitch to king four.,"And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesnt like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state."
Checkmate. Patient can't use his leg. You have to concede.,Or I could just knock all the pieces onto the floor.,Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. kay. The mind has to wrap around the foot. Okay.
"We were right that it's a brain issue, but wrong about toxic inhalation and metal poisoning. Everyone else is waiting",That was totally courageous of Khloe to Tweet about her weight gain.,"Im getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr."
Obviously I'll let you treat your Patient.,"What are you doing? We got a Patient with a walking disorder who can't seize. No, wait. I'm close, though, right?",Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
No clinic hours for the next quarter.,"Yeah, three Parking spots, next to each other, so I can Park diagonally, and three pairs of your underwear. I'm thinking of taking up sailing.",Six years and two months.
"Forget it. Treat your Patient, don't treat your Patient. Come to the meeting, don't come to the meeting. I'm done playing your game. She leaves.","You realize the game is automatically over when the loser loses, right?","Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient?"
Neurological Lyme disease explains the seizures and the paralysis.,But not the fact that Chase seems to be treating you.,Theyll never let you within a hundred yards of him.
You make a good point about the antibody titers.,He's a rock. How's your brother homeless guy? Haven't heard from him in months!,"Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr."
"Postural hypotension, which could have reduced the blood supply to his brain.",He'd be a miserable wretch.,"And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know."
"Actually, the prognosis is","Oh, I'm sorry. No, I just meant his life is gonna unravel. In fairness, that applies to any diagnosis. Why do we do this?","Oh really? So youre saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!"
"His life may unravel, it may not. He's not chasing after material things.",Too bad. He might actually get those.,Will he finished what he begins?
"And she'll nEver live up to the memory, and the thrill of finding her will wear off, and he won't Even be able to dream about being happy.",Interesting.,Yknow she might not even notice hes gone.
"The Patient may have found some long-ago nookie, but it doesn't mean he hasn't had some in the meantime. Herpes encephalitis.","Explains the neurological symptoms. EEG to confirm, I.V. acyclovir to treat. How's Foreman's BP holding?",I expect he will.
How's Foreman's BP holding? Same.,"That's strange, since I unplugged the lead 30 seconds ago.","So, how you holdin up?"
"That's strange, since I unplugged the lead 30 seconds ago. Admirable effort. Foreman takes the blood pressure device off and starts to leave. House stops him. And I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm scared you might turn green and rip through your own clothes. They all leave, Thirteen the last. House blocks her way out with his cane.",Down on the Patient's roMance because your own lifespan is shorter than dinner and a movie?,"Okay, for this next one everyone hop out."
You're the one who said miserable stays miserable.,You keep saying it. SEveral times a day.,Youre the one who said we needed more culture.
I guess I could keep my motel room another night or two. They both smile at each other before she leaves the room.,Need a consult.,"Hey, what if we leave tonight?"
"Well, scan his abdomen.","Yeah, let's assume we'd already figured that out on our own, and found a mass on the pancreas. He hands the scan to Wilson, who takes a look.",In the 1800s that was considered flirting.
Mass looks solid. I'd say it's cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the neurological symptoms. You need to get a piece of it. Schedule a CT-guided biopsy.,"Yeah, let's assume we'd already figured that out on our own.","Well, at least you make each other laugh."
Then what's this consult?,Why haven't you been yelling at me about the Cuddy twins?,"Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later."
Because you're doing the right thing.,Are we talking about the same issue? Is there something I don't know about that I'm responding to appropriately?,Youre talking about my hysterectomy.
"House enters loudly, carrying a surgery tray with a hip prothesis inside, which he throws on the table. House.",Ex-not-mom-in-law.,"Chandler and Joeys, Joey is entering, angrily."
You said you weren't coming.,After you said pretty please with sugar on top?,Youre not coming with us?
He is being an ass. If I could join you in suing him,She's like this in bed too. Always scheming to get the Lawyers out of the room.,"You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, Im suing!"
"If House isn't going to take this seriously, I know a few Judges who will.",Was I supposed to be the good cop?,Says the former member of the Corn Queens Court.
You had to go all Wile E. Coyote on me.,You told me that Arlene wanted me in the middle of it. I had to show her that no good would come of that.,"No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I cant defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his meemaw. Enchanted bunny."
Seriously? That's your rationalization? They leave the elevator and walk to House's office. How about you didn't like that Cuddy tricked you? Even though you wanted the same thing as her. You didn't like that she got the best of you. You've got more anger toward her than you realize.,I'm happier without her. I'm not stupidly expecting her to make me happy. I'm happier with my unhappiness. Pops Vicodin.,"I know. Ohoh, wait did you hear thathear that? Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?"
We can't give the Patient chemo. His platelet count's through the floor.,"Even worse, it'd contain his cancers. If we want to know what they have in common, we got to see where they spread next.","Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woohoo."
You want to wait six months while the cancer spreads and his seizures and paralysis get worse?,"reasonably Well, now, that's crazy talk. But if we pump the Patient full of vascular endothelial growth factor!","Hey! I want to say something. Ive been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldnt even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didnt any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. Its like sometimes some of you act like I dont even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now were not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldnt have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didnt care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now youre with someone else. And thats... fine. Its... whatever. Thats not what... Im not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that Im just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. Its a good day."
You want to grow more and bigger cancers?,"We can't figure out what three small ones have in common, maybe can figure out what eight big ones have in common?","Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard."
"Makes no difference to us, but you may want to make out a will.","Go get lotto boy's consent, and turn his cancers up to 11. They leave, except Thirteen, that House blocks again. He shows her a photograph.",Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
"You, what, found my old yearbook, and got a picture of my high school boyfriend?","Actually, that would have been a lot simpler.",Remember when we were in high school together?
He dumped me after I hooked up with his sister.,Would you mind letting him down gently? I might have made promises you can't keep.,"Well, but thats what he was for me."
I need a hooker.,Not if you can make that work. Foreman gives up and sits.,. Come on. Lets find a brothel.
How is that supposed to relax you? It's not for me. It's for Chase.,I'm saving myself too. Maybe you should get a couple.,Dont you want to relax?
You're riding me. Why not ride him?,Because I can get a rise out of your BP.,"You should give me the reins, Im a better rider than you."
Because I can get a rise out of your BP. His pee-pee on the other hand! Forget yoga. Embrace Zen. You're a repressed idiot. He's a horny idiot. Neither one of you can do anything about it. Pretty sure that's Zen.,Thought we were meeting in Cuddy's office.,"Yeah, I know."
"HowEver much it hurt, I did have a right to break up with you.",You just want Everything to have a hidden personal agenda.,"I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle."
You need to get over it instead of torpedoing our jobs out of spite.,Couldn't just be that you're a pain professionally.,"Look, Im just glad we can laugh about it."
"Stop! You're both at fault here. You for trying to Manipulate House when you used to know better, and you for! being you, which is an especially bad idea under the circumstances.",I had good reasons.,Wow. It sounds to me like you dont want us to live together.
"If I hadn't played him, he'd have found out about the meeting and crashed it anyway.",Would have been a lot more efficient.,"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
"Enough! Okay, here's what's gonna happen. Tomorrow I drive both of you to Arlene's. You're gonna write her a personal check for $30,000, and tell her she can stay in her own home with your blessing. You're gonna do this because you actually give a crap about your job and this hospital and your mother, and possibly Even House. To House And you're gonna say, I'm sorry, and not utter one syllable more.",Because I'm an idiot?,Im not gonna live with your mother.
"No, because if you don't, I'm gonna tell the pharmacy to stop issuing Vicodin prescriptions in my name.",I'm not paying for gas.,No. I need to do it. This is on me.
"Mom, here's a check. It's a settlement for all you've been through. Of course you can stay in your home. It was wrong of me to suggest otherwise. She slips away. Arlene smiles at House, waiting.",I'm sorry. That we saved your life. A beat. In the way that we did.,"Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me."
You have to lash out at Everyone who tries to help you? Live in your own kitchen sink for all I care.,"Harsh. I didn't think you had a case before, but that is no way to talk to a Patient.","Well, theres a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems."
"This test is what raised my blood pressure. I'm used to it now. Deep breaths, waves his arms. Go. If it's autoimmune and he created antibodies that ended up fighting his own tumors!",Growth factor would have made the underlying autoimmune condition better.,Do you think they have yesterdays daily news?
Amyloidosis? His EKG voltage has been on the low end of normal. What if the tumors were actually protein deposits?,"G.I. biopsy to confirm, chemo to treat.","Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught?"
She's making that diagnosis based off of low-normal EKG. Low-normal is still normal. Rising blood pressure That thing cannot be right.,"Low-normal is still low, and that thing does not have money riding on you being wrong, like the rest of us do.","Man, she is really gullible."
"Because I took a beta blocker! Chase shows him the trick he's been hiding. Both times, right? His platelet count's still low. Chemo's still a death sentence. Treating for Amyloid with normal EKG is like doing heart surgery on a guy because he's ten pounds overweight. It's insane.","Well, we'll do it your way go shout at the Patient till he gets better. G.I. biopsy to confirm, chemo to treat. He blocks Thirteen on her way out.",I need your help.
I heard Cuddy quadrupled your clinic hours.,"Yeah, but you know what? I'm flying through Patients.",Joeys gonna be thrilled!
Arlene wants another meeting.,"I know. Told my seconds to tell her seconds that she gets no second chance. Well, technically, it's a third chance, but I don't have thirds.","Mr. Zelners office, Rachel has come back again to try and do that second interview."
"Cuddy told her the same thing, more or less.",So you got us on the same page after all.,Penny implied the same thing.
"I've been thinking about your irrationality, and I've come up with a rational explanation for it.",That's quite a challenge.,Im glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
"You don't want to let go of Cuddy, so you're clinging to the negative interaction, because some small part of you thinks the bad stuff beats nothing at all.",You're almost making this work. All you got to do now is change reality. Perhaps if I was the one suing me.,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
"Patient had a cardiac arrest, and his lungs and liver failed before we Even started the chemo.","Brain symptoms that aren't brain symptoms, tumors that come and go?",Ill give you another minute.
It's not Amyloidosis.,"You're forgetting alopecia. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were just listing the things it's not, alphabetically.",I want to go on a ride along!
His long-lost love is a fraud. Thirteen figured that out.,Good for her.,Hes not 11!
The truth made him miserable.,It's like there's two of me.,And whats this truth you plan on telling him today?
We'll let the court decide who's whining since you're so sure,We're not getting back together.,Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that...
What are you talking about?,It's the only explanation.,"Theyre cute when theyre about to wet themselves, arent they?"
"Then you're an idiot with impossible standards. Cuddy turns to House, who is not there any more.",Common enemy.,So youyou dont want to live with Don in a cheese house?
But the cancer?,Was cancer. Just growing so fast it collapsed under its own weight.,"The smokers balcony, Rachel, Kim, and Nancy are all puffing away on their cancer sticks."
Am I gonna live?,"Cut out the teratoma, what's left of your cancer, you should be fine. Think of it as your second luckiest day.",How about we just have a little quiet time now?
It's hard to feel lucky. The Woman I love was a fraud.,"No, actually a fraud was a fraud. You fell for her just the same. You may stay miserable, but your long-lost love is not gonna be the reason why.","Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world."
It's the real Jennifer. Or at least the only one to show up who actually has the birthmark. He's renting her an apartment.,It'll end horribly.,Rachels really the one whos pregnant.
"Not for him. She may take all his money, and he may be a naive idiot, but! he'll always be hopeful, so he'll always be happy.",You lost your mother.,"Oh! Oh, I cant believe it! I mean I think its great! For him. She might be able to do better."
"I think if you spend your days designing Ever more effective ways to blow people up, stuff's bound to come back to you.",Thirsty. Side effect of a new antihistamine I'm on.,"Okay, let me stop you right there."
You don't seem congested.,"Hmm, intriguing.",Do I look puffy?
You have any thoughts about our Patient?,Got some questions about whether Thirteen really beliEves in karma or just wants to.,Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
We could ask to look through her office and we could do an MRI first.,Sure. Go ahead.,But hell be the heir.
"If you're not interested in the case, why'd you take it?",I am definitely interested. Could be a tumor. Could be a CNS bleed. What do you do when you got two interesting puzzles?,"Because I wouldnt want an innocent person, who doesnt know anything about the form."
Let's go. Let's go. Again wiggling his fingers for the money,Bet's off. Fight was fixed. Wilson opens his arms wide in what are you talking about? fashion. That punch barely touched him.,Goin. Ok. Where we goin? Doesnt matter. Goin to the go go. Ohok.
You bet on Foley to beat Zachary?,Speed beats power! unless speed has been paid to speedily take a dive.,"Okay. Like hes going to win anyway, right?"
"He touched him enough to put him on the canvas and the official counted him out, which means you officially owe me! 50 bucks. As soon as he says the amount, the dance starts again. Wilson is really enjoying this win.",We bet on a sporting Event. That was not sporting. Less than 30 seconds. That was barely Even Event-y.,"Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats."
"Okay, here's what I saw. You lost and I won.","Yeah, well, you can take that to your grave. You're not taking my 50 bucks.",You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen.
"Prove it. Prove it or pay up. You got one day. And don't make me send my boys out looking for you. He turns toward the door, stops, and puts up a warning finger, which he points at various members of the team. Quietly What? All right. He leaves.","So, two puzzles. Tie goes to the one that costs me money. He grabs his cane and heads for the door. Keep each other posted.","All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonards bedroom.

"Look, if you were a bookie, you'd know no one pays a guy to throw a fight he has no chance to win. I was a 12-to-1 underdog. Lost my last five fights.",But you were the better fighter. That last punch barely touched you.,"Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!"
"You Ever been barely touched by a guy who weighs 230 pounds? Look at me. Look where I am, what I'm wearing. Now, do I look like a guy who just got a payday? I didn't throw the fight. I just suck.",Ha! slams door Proof.,Ive seen guys like you.

You want us to help you get out of paying your bet while your actual Patient lies in agony.,Who's the real bad guy here?,"Well, thats not good."

You're an idiot. She's in the doorway to the living room.,How did you get in here?,"Oh, she isnt home."
My boss has me break into places all the time.,"Pain has been getting worse.

You're an idiot.,You drove all the way over here to break in and call me an idiot?,Im not talking to you like youre an idiot!
"No, I drove all the way over here to tell you we're implanting an automated cardio-defibrillator, which won't actually do anything to help the Patient except maybe give us enough time to come up with a guess as to what's actually wrong with her.","Oh, that makes more sense.",Chocolate!

"Not yet. But that's part of the beauty. Since the compound is easily excreted in urine, as long as they keep hydrated, there's really no reason to expect any danger at virtually any dose. I mean, obviously you can't know for sure.","But if it's worthy of the preface obviously, then obviously it only needs to be explained to idiots.","No, its 435."

Why aren't you more alarmed? We're running out of time.,"yelling Aahh, she's dying! speaking normally again Were you able to figure out what was wrong while I was screaming?","I dont want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed"
Infection was the first thing that the transplant team treated for.,Which would have worked if the bacteria had been out in the open.,She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
reaParkng for and eating a piece of fruit But that's what white blood cells are.,"They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry. But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above. Park still does not understand",Help him! Someone help him!
"They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry. But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above. Park still does not understand",explaining Antibiotics and IVIG.,The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses.
Did you use metaphors for your old team? Or do you just think I'm particularly stupid?,"No, they were stupid too.","Hey, look. They named their team after me."
to Vanessa Hey beautiful. Hi.,lifting his head to look at Wilson Case is under control. It's me time.,Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
Vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry. House props himself up on his elbows and looks at Wilson You were right to push me. I needed that. Thank you.,So we're good?,I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown.
"It was good advice. Just, came here to say thank you.",I like you.,It wasnt bad advice.
"The thing is, House! I don't like you. He leaves",When did the discoloration start?,"Ok, you guys, I dont mean to make things worse, but umm, I dont want to live with Rachel anymore."
A few minutes after I started the IVIG.,Means we're wrong about infection.,About 12 seconds ago.
"And by we, you mean you. You screwed up the lungs.","Wrong about autoimmune, not cancer, heavy metals, genetic issues! Increase peep.","So anyway we really Honey, were just smoking all over you."
Already maxed out. We're close to the point of no return. The lungs will nEver be viable for transplant.,I need! I need ideas.,"Now, its not enough!"
I need ideas. IgA nephropathy.,That's already ruled out.,Anything would help.
That's already ruled out. Lupus.,frustrated No--o.,"Okay, okay, okay."
Maybe we're just out of time.,We're out of time when we're out of time. When they die or she dies. Keep them stable as long as you can. I need to think. He leaves,"SeeThreepio, do you copy?"
Make a wish. Make a wish.,The lungs are a smoker. speaking to the lungs You of all people should know better.,"For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them."
But the kid nEver smoked.,He played poker. Who plays poker without cigars? Even if he didn't light up himself! It was a rainy night. The windows were closed.,"Yeahhh. Im tellin ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time...."
He played poker. Who plays poker without cigars? Even if he didn't light up himself! It was a rainy night. The windows were closed.,All parents think their kids are special.,"We were playing poker, alright."
"Eosiniphilic pneumonitis. But, the steroids would have treated for that.","I was right. Not about anything medical, but my metaphors were perfect. We need to hit it harder. We need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg. We need the nuclear option.","All right, well, cant you, like, slip him some money or something?"
"At some point you're going to say we need to radiate, right?","See, the metaphors work.","Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
But that'll destroy the good lung too. Better to go with a strong cocktail of immunosuppressants.,Won't be fast enough. Wilson needs these lungs.,You sound pretty defensive Michael.
This is all you get. Ortho still has the outer office.,"Well, that sucks. Where are Chase, Taub, and Thirteen gonna sit?",What if this doesnt work?
"You're welcome, House.",Oof!,"Youre welcome, baby."
Dinner later? I'll pick something up.,still lying on the floor and rubbing his jaw I heard about a good new vegetarian place.,"Umm, anywayDo you want to have dinner tonight?"
Why am I watParkng you cut your hair?,"If I do it at home, I'm the one who has to clean it up.",I dont want you to shave everything.
I was referring less to where it's happening and more to why.,"New life, new look.","Okay, correct me if Im wrong, but isnt that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?"
Does that mean you like your new life?,"If you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.","So, are you excited to have your own place again?"
"It doesn't seem like much of a case. Although, I'm sure I'm wrong!",You are. Tell me why.,Well... thats not gonna hold up in court.
"Guy collapsed after being on his feet for hours on a hot day without breakfast, so! that's really weird.","E.R. found nothing wrong, then I decided I should test his wallet.","We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that."
He's rich? That's why we're taking the case?,"No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him. And he's rich.","Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus."
"No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him. And he's rich.",Dr. Adams. To Park Give her the file.,"Yes, Michael is going to be crossexamined today, whichll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but its a deposition."
This is my only copy.,"My M.O. depends upon the use of a team. Definitionally, that involves! more than one person. So I really have no choice. Give her the file.","Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, theres no turning back."
You can't afford a team.,"Adams is free. And I'm referring both to her availability and her price tag Adams gives him a look. New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa.","You know, Im not sure a sports team is the way to go."
You said we were meeting for coffee.,"Well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee.",I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said coffee.
I thought you were referring to talking.,"Talking about medicine. Specifically, as it refers to the guy whose name is on the file she still hasn't handed you.","Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?"
"I'm not working, House. I'm in the process of looking for a paying job.","In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town ladling kittens, spaying soup!","Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean youre not working and the economy is bad."
There is a free clinic in Trenton.,"Well, think of this as today's free clinic. Only with fewer bums with herpes.",You know those posters for the city free clinic?
I don't think we actually have much of a case. I think it's just dehydration.,What happened the last time another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?,"Ah, I thought Id find you here, Nasforatool."
I lost my job.,You saved a life.,Hey. I just lost a job for you.
Most people with his kind of money are commissioning oil paintings of their Yorkshire terrier. Benjamin is sacrificing his own comfort to help others.,That's because helping others is his Yorkie oil painting.,"Okay, yes, I see the confusion."
"That's naive and sick. You really want to improve things? You do it through policy. This guy empties his pockets, what really changes?","That's right, all those babies with AIDS, they're just using us.",In what sense is that a compromise?
"My parents had $800 between them when they got here. They scraped and borrowed so we could go to good schools, and I worked my ass off. No one gave me a handout. It makes me work harder.",Pointing to Adams Rebuttal.,It doesnt matter.
What's your evil plan?,I object to your cynicism.,Im going to kill the queen.
It's been earned.,That's what I object to.,"But Pheebs, yknow you earned it."
"My theory is that you're running a battery of tests to convince him that you saved his life, then con him into funding you to hire back your team.",Sarcastically What?,"If I took this promotion, itd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
Your old team?,Shouts What?,"Hi, remember us?"
"This is your new reality. You've got your office. You've got neighbors. You've got one employee, one volunteer. Until she finds actual, paid work, or gets sick of you.",I talked to Chase and Taub. They're willing to come back.,"Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager."
What about Thirteen?,Not a good choice. She's not long term because she has no long term.,"Well, which is it, ten or eleven?"
Not taking your calls?,She will.,I never get calls!
Discharge the Patient.,"Unexplained loss of consciousness could be cardiomyopathy, global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage",I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
"You've got two choices, House. You can recognize that your Patient is just a very nice, healthy guy, and send him home, or you can consider altruism a symptom. In which case, you cannot take his money. Walks out",To Park Send him home. And check with admitting for the net worth of all new Patients.,"Well, what if its his only way out?"
"Sitting in a couch I'm not coming back, House.","Technically, you're back right now.",Theres no back to this couch!
"While standing upI need you to stop calling me. First 17 messages were cute, but",I'm putting the band back together.,See thatll stop when you pick up the phone.
"Interesting that you nEver showed up at my place, what with your love of annoying me and your inability to take no for an answer. I'm guessing ankle monitor.",Showing her his monitor Guilty as charged. Literally.,"Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?"
"I'm not a doctor anymore, House.","The job went away, but not the profession.","A Fire House, Phoebe has gone to break up with Vince."
Turns out I like boring.,"No, you wanna like boring. But if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored.","I thought this was gonna be boring, but its actually kind of fun."
Please stop calling me.,As she leaves No.,Well now you cant call me at all.
As she leaves No.,You showed up to tell me that you don't want to hear from me.,"Uh nono, sheshes out for the night."
Patient got tachycardic to 185. We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine. There's definitely something wrong with him.,"Which is awesome. Now there's something to cure, which means there's something to be disproportionately financially grateful for.",What are you going to do with your time off?
Got you a coffee. Thanks.,Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.,"your welcome again, Im gonna make some coffee can I get you anything?"
What about Whipple's?,"If it was Whipple's, there'd be some kind of neurological involvement.",The pizzaplace across the street any good?
You don't think defying huMan nature is neurological?,Racing heart Medical condition. Bleeding heart Stupid condition.,"A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man."
"Are you saying that because you beliEve it, or because it's in your financial best interest to think his generosity isn't just temporary?",I'm told that some people are just nice. I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.,"Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything."
Benjamin's been taking allergy medication the last few weeks. Long QT syndrome can be medication-induced.,"Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines, then do an EKG.",What did we just finish talking about Ben?
Walks out Benjamin's room--,I just got so angry.,And heres little Ben nodding off.
How about I help you out?,How do you mean?,"Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?"
"I'll give a million dollars as an endowment to the hospital, earmarked for diagnostics.",Wow.,Id give 35% to AIDS related charities.
Is that bad?,Ethics are not my strong suit.,"No, but thats bad!"
Ethics are not my strong suit. Wilson's office--,"Hypothetical if I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic, do I have to decline?",And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake.
"You can't take sex from a sexaholic. You can't give booze to an alcoholic, and you can't take this guy's money.",Could be wrong about the symptom. I'm wrong all the time.,I have come to an important decision.
Taking money from a sick person is ethically suspect at best.,"What is this, Canada? All we do is take money from sick people.",I just think its kind of cheap to undonate money to a charity.
We work for it.,I'm working!,"Eh, you work for that."
I'm working! How much?,"20 dollars. Wilson gesticulates Well, what if it was? It's the same principle. 20 dollars, a million! What's the difference?",I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
"Actually, the difference is pretty much a million dollars.","He came up with the figure, not me.",Thats still a lot of money!
"Crap. Got a Patient with end stage renal disease. Her heart can't support dialysis. She needs a transplant, but! House is thinking, looking distracted you tuned out as soon as it stopped being about you, didn't you?",What?,Can I have everyones attention please?
I gotta go.,"It's all moot. Patient pRobably has long QT. PRobably just a really, really decent person. They exist, right?","Oh, Im engaged to Pam."
"I'm not sure, but it's not what we thought it was. PPTH cafeteria--","So! arrhythmia, fainting, muscle tremors. Plus, unfortunately, mental changes.",Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?
To House I still don't think it's neurological. Park sits beside Adams,God bless you.,That doesnt make sense.
He lost his wife because she couldn't accept not being filthy rich.,To Park She's not drinking the coffee either.,He didnt find a wife.
Why? Why?,"Yeah, why?","Why, why is that?"
You're not a stranger. And your perverse view of the world is making you force a neurological component onto an obviously cardiological,Your parents didn't love you enough.,"Yeah, well, dont be a stranger."
There's a whole list of drugs that could have caused his symptoms.,I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs when there are orphans out there without cable.,"Well, we are looking forward to having you, so, let me just pull up your information here."
That comes with a rash. Echovirus.,"Echoing Virus, virus, virus, virus!",Come here.
"Fits his physical symptoms. And could, but doesn't necessarily cause personality changes. House and Park look at her Works for Everyone?",Start him on antivirals.,"Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women."
on the phone from her House Click the third tab from the left and find the box that says previous entries. You get a drop-down menu sorted by Patient name and department.,Thank you. Appreciate your help.,Youre going to have to call her.
"You're gonna read too much into this, aren't you?","No, not at all.","Rach, I think youre reading a little too much into it."
We're gonna fundamentally disagree about what it means to read too much into this. Aren't we?,"Yes, absolutely.",I wouldnt read too much into it.
"Look, I thought about what you said, and I realized you were right.",Great. See you tomorrow morning.,"You know, I."
"No, you won't.",Afternoon? I can't think of another interpretation.,Whywhy would I care about that?
"Shut up. Look, I'm not sure what you were trying to aParkEve. I'm nEver quite sure. But you were actually a friend to me when I needed it. I don't wanna come back to work for you. But I was wrong to try to push you out of my life.","Looking at his computer screen Everything has gone blue. That's not supposed to happen, right?","Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you?"
Stay there. I'm comin'.,"No! you don't have to do that. Although, if you did come, maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace and get some lo mein and a Szechuan beef.","Mmmmm. Im probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost."
That is six miles out of my way.,"Oh, okay, then. Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere.","OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop."
Sighs Fine. I'll get the food.,You're a peach.,Great! Lets get some food. Im starving.
What's your Patient's status?,Better. We're discharging him.,"Hey, so whats the status."
Sighs Good. Starts walking back to the clinic,"Hey, hey, hey. Why do you care? Specifically. Although I'm curious about a general answer too.","OK, were leaving for the hospital at 1."
Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney to my Patient with renal failure.,Did he meet your Patient with renal failure?,"This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life."
"No, he heard the nurses talking about her, that she was short on time.",I was wrong.,Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
"Don't say that. House, she really needs this kidney.",He's not better. His mental status is declining.,Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?
Or he's doing an amazing thing for another huMan being.,I thought it was an ethical no-brainer that we can't take stuff from sick people.,"And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds."
"PPTH corridor, walking to Benjamin's room--",He's still sick.,The hallway. Leonard is outside Pennys door.
His symptoms have gone away.,Not all of them. Offering an organ to a stranger is a symptom.,Well then maybe you should take it.
A couple dozen people a year make undirected kidney donations.,"Yeah, how Many of them are also in the process of pauperizing themselves?","Seriously, dont even give it to charity, you wont be helping anyone."
"If the guy threw himself on a grenade, he'd be a hero. If it saves a life, who cares?","You do! Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument. If there's Even a chance I'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.","Look, I didnt want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die."
More dangerous than complete renal failure? My Patient needs this. Now.,"Yeah. If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year, all would be golden.","Oh, how kind of her."
I'll give you your money.,See? Crazy.,You know let me give you some money for this.
She'll die without it. Perfectly logical.,People with mental deficiency can be logical. Just like sane people can be illogical.,You understand wed all be dead if not for her.
"Dr. House, it's not a symptom. Come back after you're convinced that I'm healthy, and I will give you your money.","No, you won't. Limps out to a bench where Park is sitting. She gets up and follows him","It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now Ive heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission."
"No, you won't. Limps out to a bench where Park is sitting. She gets up and follows him",We have time for one more test before we move him.,"Hi! Can you do that and walk? Cause she said, Next."
We have time for one more test before we move him. What test?,"WhatEver test will prove there was an echovirus-irus-irus, and he's not cured, obviously.","Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so Ive served them."
"I've been saying all along this could be Whipple's. Causes arrhythmia, tremor, and mental changes.",Bad idea. There's no joint pain. Where's Adams?,Its a gravitational wobble.
Why is she here?,'Cause I called her. Bigger question is why that worked.,Im still not sure why this woman is even here.
I'm here because I have time and you have a crisis and I,We're too busy for rationalizations. Patient made a big downgrade in his personal life. He's pRobably not eating all that healthy.,"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her"
He's pRobably not eating all that healthy. Magnesium deficiency?,"Wait until they take him back to his room draw blood, do an expanded electrolyte profile.","Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart."
"Joint pain is common, but not definitive. Whipple's explains all of his symptoms, including the personality change. And it would respond to antibiotics, which is why he started to feel better. Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.",To Park You were right. Counts for nothing if you can't defend it. Book a procedure room. Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.,"She says as time goes on, hes gonna start getting agressive and violent."
To Park You were right. Counts for nothing if you can't defend it. Book a procedure room. Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.,Guilt. You feel guilty about leaving.,"Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude."
"Yes, I think that little of you and that much of me. You're nothing without me. she gets up",Not leaving me. Leaving huManity.,You dont think I get up when you get up?
I'm going with my girlfriend. The Woman I love.,To have fun.,Im going alone.
"You're trying to make me feel guilty because you're saving lives here. And I think that's great. I'm proud to have been a part of it, but! now! I just wanna be happy.",Oh! no one's unhappy in Greece.,I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment.
It just appeared in the last few weeks. He's having trouble holding a pencil in school.,"Does it itch? Do anything different lately? You get a new baseball glove, a new kitten?","Well, I was just playing with him, and yknow we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly hes leaving out e and f."
"Well, the neighbors put in a pool, so he's been spending a lot of time over there. But, well, if it was something in the water, it would be Everywhere, wouldn't it?",It is in the water.,It cant mean that!
He's allergic to chlorine?,No! Inhales deeply He's allergic to summer lilac.,"Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster."
That's my lotion. And it's not in the pool.,"No, it's on the palms of his hands.","Ohh, II see lotion, I have lotion!"
Endoscopy didn't rEveal any lesions in the small intestine. I'm running PCR test now.,Found it in my office. Appears to be a gift. That can't be good. Gives it to Park,All right relax Mr.
Gives it to Park Damn it.,You got her the job interview.,Give me back my parking space.
And that was supposed to be the end of it. I! don't take charity.,Good for you! You loon.,"Its not charity, Joe"
I don't like owing people things.,"So either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you.","No no no, if I couldnt pay you back right away then Id feel guilty and tense every time I saw you."
I just don't like it. It makes me feel! icky.,That's the reason? Ickiness? You nEver Even tried to analyze this? It's Even crazier than the gift thing.,"Yeah. I dont know why, but something about it feels unnatural."
House! looking at the computer screen there's no sign of tropheryma DNA. It's not Whipple's.,Well! we did what we could.,Pshh. Thats a bedbug.
Almost always hits the kidneys.,"Ah, Dr.",Well it hit me anyway!
You're off the case.,That seems like an overreaction.,"Now, off the record, youre not"
That's idiotic. Foreman gives her a look Sorry.,"Don't apologize. I don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid, but I know she's right. Two lives are in the balance here.","Uhuh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Rosss behalf."
"House, I worked for you for sEven years. I know how you operate. So when I see symptoms magically show up right when you need them",And I was your boss for sEven years.,"Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem."
What'd you give him?,Nothing! You can't prove otherwise. So why don't you do the smart thing here?,"Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe."
You can't let him do this.,Sighs He's the boss. And he's right.,Im going to let him.
I assume you dosed the Patient because you're really certain he has a neurological condition?,I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light 'cause you didn't get the job? Paper crumpling What's with you and Park?,"Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. Stanley, are you having an affair?"
Paper crumpling What's with you and Park? Nothing.,I expect my people to lie better than that.,Dont try to change the subject.
I just! I thought it was interesting she couldn't accept that coffee. I wanted to see how deep it went.,But now?,"I did. It was right here. She mustve Oh, my God, were living together."
"Oh, now I just want to win.",Chuckles softly What was in the box?,"Oh, well now, well never win."
Gift certifiCate. The Spa.,"Nah, that's not gonna do it.","Oh, its a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO."
"Nah, that's not gonna do it. You're up against a lifetime of training. If you wanna win, you gotta do something she can't possibly reciproCate. You gotta push her neuroses to the point where Even she thinks that she's crazy.","One more favor. Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forEver. Or I'm lying. Either way, it's more interesting than whatEver you're doing now.",You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
"Arrhythmia, muscle tremors, and, yes, mental changes. If his heart doesn't rupture, he's liable to rip it out and give it away.","You know, the down vibe in here is totally ruining my Charlie's Angels fantasy. Buzzing continues To Park And that haircut isn't helping, either.","Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut."

"No department. No money. And somehow, you Managed to con her into hanging around.","I have a gift. Suddenly, it hits him. He gets one of his million-yard stares, those where he figures what's the deal with his Patient, typical when he's with Wilson","Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carols great and Im sure youre a very attractive man, but I."
"He gets one of his million-yard stares, those where he figures what's the deal with his Patient, typical when he's with Wilson What?",It was a con.,"Final question, young Ryan Howard."
The Patient was faking?,"No, I was.","No, no, no, no, no."
You think he's allergic to Iodine?,"No, again.","No, thank you."
Then you pumped his body full of Iodine and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.,"I said don't interrupt. But, yes, you're right. Take out the nodule, he'll be fine.","Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean."

"No, it wasn't. I'm still gonna",Keep less? How much less? Just enough to spoil your kids?,"It was, it was okay."
Just enough to spoil your kids? No.,But they need it more than people with TB or Parkldren in Indonesia with no eyes? Diagnosticians with hearts of gold?,"I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding."

You got the money? How?,Patient's a smart businessMan.,Not with money.
He's destroying thousands of jobs.,"Jobs are not being destroyed. They're being reloCated. The fact that you see that as inherently bad means you're an irrational patriot. To put it another way, a patriot.","I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff."

"Well, their company's making a decision I strongly disagree with.",Yet you were nEver anything but courteous to the racists and rapists in prison. Those guys made decisions you supported?,"Uh, it doesnt seem like theres much of a point if the companys going under."
Those guys made decisions you supported? Myelodysplastic syndrome.,I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral you attended yesterday morning.,"Oh, Im still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids whos moms didnt kill themselves, so by supporting them, Im doing a good thing, but Im not happy about it."
I was at a job interview.,You got to work at 915. Closest hospital with an opening in your specialty is 45 minutes away. It's not possible. My condolences.,"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said."

I remember you saying something about how loyalty to real estate was stupid.,"This is about reclaiming stolen property! Loyalty to real estate is stupid, because loyalty is stupid.","I dont like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you aint investing in property, then youre dumber than a dummy."
"First patriotism, now loyalty. You hate ice cream too?","French vanilla, yeah. To willfully identify yourself as something else is a perversion of self-expression.","If Im a traitor, then you are, too."

"And this time, a land war in Russia will be a good idea. Deal?",Here's what I'm thinking.,"Were finally going to war, old friend?"
"Here's what I'm thinking. You went to a parole hearing, where one of your old Patients was denied. Hence the attire, hence the tardiness. And, most important, hence the anger. You think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here. More annoyingly, by having me do it. Adams walks away.

No spoilers. They ruin Everything.",Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.
Pulmonology was that way.,Our Patient's lung pRoblem is not a lung pRoblem. It's a brain pRoblem. We're consulting with Neurology.,I guess. It wasnt until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.
That's my old boss. You don't actually think this is neurological.,"I don't know what it is. Maybe I should just accept the Patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.","No. But compared to your boss, hes the poster boy for sanity."

Then it's a good thing he has A.D.S.,"Do you really beliEve in this diagnosis? Because if this is just a pissing contest, you are at a sEvere anatomical disadvantage.","Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men Ive ever been with."
It's autonomic dysregulation syndrome.,No! it's normal pressure hydrocephalus. Do a spinal fluid test to confirm.,Im still not sure why this woman is even here.
She's not yours to fire.,"You guys better fire her for insubordination, 'cause she went rogue, and my Patient is now in a coma.","Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she wont go easy."

I can't beliEve you did that.,Right back at ya. Our Patient's dying. We need theories.,I cant believe I did this!
It's gotta be normal pressure hydrocephalus. Andrews predicted the coma.,"Yeah, but Even a broken doctor's right twice a day. Patient wasn't wet, wobbly, or wacky. Coma had to be a lucky guess.",My last physical.
"If you didn't think he was right, then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?",I didn't. I wanted you to do a tilt table test.,"He was our prisoner, awaiting trial."
You have a wonderful way of communicating.,I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table.,Youre a good talker.

Pull me out. Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?"
"No, we already tested his liver enzymes. They're normal.",Or his liver's so far gone it can't Even produce enzymes.,"Yeah, a little tip he says he can eat frozen yoghurt."
"Biopsy was clean. It's not his liver. I also ran the spinal fluid test, and you were right that Andrews was wrong. His ICP was not normal. It was elevated. What about HTLV?",We ruled that out three days ago.,Get that waste of money out of my face.
"Because of his heart pRoblems, but","Once something gets taken off the board, I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.","Well, he mentioned it in his mothers eulogy, so why not?"

"If this is really about family, you will not do this. Morning.",Got lucky this time.,Today is about family.
"No, you didn't. I made this bet so you'd stop actively trying to fire Park so you'd be neutral. You went out of your way to help her. She obviously earned your respect, passed whatEver test you","I sabotaged her hearing. You do read the school paper, don't you?",I think you knew exactly what you were doing.
"If you had sabotaged her hearing, she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist. What you actually did was make her emotional and make the board members see her as a victim.",'Cause the panel feels badly for incompetent doctors who nearly kill people.,Yknow what? This is not fair to her. Lets just forget the tape!
"You know that Everyone on that panel hates you. You know the minute you recommend firing anyone, they start discussing how big a bonus to give them.",That's just hurtful.,"Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said You gotta fire four people, and I was just like, What?"
What five grand?,Just take it. Trust me.,Five oh dollars.

Male Patient went into v-fib but shows no signs of heart disease,What was he doing when his heart decided to do the mambo?,Why dont you run the meeting?
He said he was at work.,You're late.,"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early."
"According to my calendar, I'm a week early.",Beard's a nice touch.,"Well, I have a late birthday and usually Septembers a cutoff point."
And I look forward to working with you as well.,"He's lying, not just Taub! the Patient. These abrasions on his knees! they're minty fresh! about ten hours old.",And Im really looking forward to working with you.
He got them playing flag football.,He said he got them playing flag football. I'm sure that's true if flag is a euphemism for penis and football is a euphemism for entering a vagina.,No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to Kings Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I cant wait to see it. And to leave this place.
Why lie about it? Everybody lies.,"Speaking of which, how are your two baby girls?","Hey, what do you want?"
"Wow, twins! congratulations.",making a big show of oops wrong thing to say Awkward!,I cant believe you didnt know its twins!

He means it's better to do it here where we can revive him than have it happen somewhere else.,The prodigal son has returned.,"I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said its the part of the Vindicators he values.

You want me to pick up an ice-cream cake?,I also think that Taub has brought his little Taubettes into work with him today.,I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Why would he do that?,"Because I didn't give him time to do anything else. Then I started wondering, who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?","Yes, and thats why were here."
They're not here.,"What? I just came for a chat with a friend. What's that I smell, friend?",Can you believe theyre still not here?

"We got the Patient's eye back in place with steroid injections, but a bulging eyeball means it's not a liver pRoblem.","And mom's determination to keep dad away, Even as her kid gets sicker and sicker, means she's got more to hide.",What do you think I am saying to you?
It's not diagnostically relevant. Let's let it drop.,You just lost my vote. You flip-flopped on parental rights.,"Uh, I think we should just drop it."

To tell him the truth. He's a virgin. How do we explain the STD? It's a medical diagnosis. Screw the parents. The kid's our Patient.,I guess Taub's got a tough choice to make when the kid wakes up.,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Why is it my choice?,'Cause you're a dad. How could the rest of us possibly understand?,Why do I have to decide?
I didn't tell him.,taking off his reading glasses Your heart said he needed to know.,"Well, were not gonna tell him I did it."
taking off his reading glasses Your heart said he needed to know. Your brain knew he's better off without it. Following your heart is easy. Following your brain is tough.

"ClEver tactic, pretending you're not interested anymore.","How could that possibly work as a tactic? The fact is, once I saw those incompletes, I knew your parents screwed you up. The details are just gravy.","Guys, this persons just going out of their way to get a rise out of you."

Steatohepatitis would make his AST and ATL lEvels rise.,"Are you calling his liver fat? Start the Patient on statins, and do a biopsy to confirm. And knock him out. I've heard he's a wiggler.",Im not gonna date a 55yearold woman.
There's no need to put him under. We can confirm fatty liver with an ultrasound. House looks to Foreman pointedly. Just making an observation.,"Well done. Now, as a member of my team, you can make the equally-useful observations that the sky is blue, I'm wearing pants, and I'm ignoring your first observation.","Holy crap, Morty."
Of course. Wait.,And there it is.,"All right, well wait."
You're trying to screw with my confidence.,"Well, if I wanted to do that, I'd tell you how much the nurses hate you.","Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is Im not."
"You're trying to get me to define myself as a subordinate to keep me from Ever intervening, Even if it's fully in the scope of my duties. Like now. This isn't about diagnostics, it's about what's safe for the Patient. Do the ultrasound.",Ultrasound it is. And the nurses love you.,"Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks."
A few hours ago you were sure.,And that's significant why?,"What, now? Are you certain?"
Sorry. Only the bleeding's medically relevant.,"No, I wasn't being rhetorical. If they are sleeping together, why do we disapprove?","Well, I didnt hear the phone ring."
"If they are sleeping together, why do we disapprove? You're pro-infidelity?",She's not married.,I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
"Yes, he does. He's in there. This is why you get married.",Said the divorced Woman to the divorced Man.,"His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does."
She is there for him in the only way that matters now. She gave up her life to take care of him.,Which proves she's an idiot.,My Catholic friend is right.
"I was right about the antiemetics. If you kept him on them like I said, he wouldn't have gotten agitated and punched his wife.","Yes, we're back to my supposed diabolical plan to shake your confidence.","Now, look, were gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today."
"Unless one of your index cards actually predicted the guy was gonna punch his wife, Everything you're saying is post hoc rationalization.",Dr.,"Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man."
You clearly wrote that after the fact.,"Dr. Adams, would you please reach into my pants? Of course she doesn't. House reaches in his pocket and retriEves yet another card.","So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
"Dr. Adams, would you please reach into my pants? Of course she doesn't. House reaches in his pocket and retriEves yet another card.",Dr.,"Michael, the pants dont have any pockets."
"No muscle symptoms, and urine had no myoglobin. TTP fits, though.","Start him on plasmapheresis. Unless! unless I need to say, mother, may I? And mother is an abbreviation. They all leave his office.",You must be cold.
Why doesn't Chase have to be here?,You think he knows anything about women who don't want to have sex?,"Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didnt come?"
Hormone lEvels are normal. This Woman seems perfectly healthy. What does it matter if she says she's asexual?,It's the fundamental drive of our species.,pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. Its a paradox to think of any sexual activity as normal. It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.
Sex drive is in the brain. I suppose it could be psychological intimacy issues caused by Parkldhood abuse.,She's been sharing a toilet with the same guy for the last ten years.,Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
It's not the same. Sex releases oxytocin. It's the neurochemical basis for bonding.,And that's why men always marry their right hands.,"Okay, but isnt sex better when its with one person that you really, really care about."
"No it's not. I've tapped over 30 guys and nEver wanted to see most of them again. House and Adams look at each other, surprised and speechless. I live next to a Jewish frat.",We are veering wildly off track. Please continue.,Really? Its not just frowned upon?
We've run Every test and ruled out all the options. You're gonna have to accept she just doesn't want sex.,"Lots of people don't have sex. The only people who don't want it are either sick, dead, or lying.","Mmhmm, tell her she cant have sex for six months."
So maybe she's lying. You think she's had a boyfriend on the side?,For ten years? Sticking around the whole time? Doesn't make sense. Thinking! What does! He grabs his cane and leaves the room without a word.,Maybe we shouldnt play due to the circumstances.
All of the shift nurses had their hands full with a double code.,Perfectly reasonable explanation. Same thing happened to me. Couldn't find my keys for days.,They all had a thing for him.
"Hey, don't be an ass. Can't you see she's upset?","No, she's guilty. 'Cause instead of being at her husband's side, she was under you.","Shes upset. Look, its gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit."
"Okay, that's y","Yeah, yeah, yeah!","Okay, that is"
Today is Saturday.,"So, at 600 a.m., the Patient wakes up, and the first thing he sees!","Saturday, so just let me know what youre doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch."
"In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's Patients regress to old routines.",So what would your husband do on a Saturday morning?,"Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. Its exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge."
That soccer trophy you were telling me about.,It's gone. Where was practice?,"Yeah, yeah, whats with the trophy!"
Not dead until he's warm and dead.,Get him to the ICU. Start him on extracorporeal circulation.,Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
"That'll raise his temperature too quickly, it'll cause acidosis.","We can deal with his metabolism crashing, we can't rEverse brain damage if we go too slowly.","So does this fellow, but he cant without it burning like hot soup."
"We still have a long way to go. Cold can be protective to the brain, but there is a possibility of damage. We also need to confirm and treat whatEver's making him sick.","I just gotta do a standard battery of tests. Blood, urine, EEG!","Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People dont just fall off of ladders."
Is that really necessary for a free flu shot?,Excuse me. I have to deal with someone who's having a panic attack.,Yeah. I heard you might need it. So...
I specifically said the bet was off if you contacted the Patient.,Exactly. NEver said anything about the Patient's husband.,"Fine, if you dont want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and Ill take possession of your Fantastic Four."
The deal was a medical reason why she doesn't have sex.,"I admit I was stuck, until I realized the medical issue was not hers but his.","What makes you think she wouldnt have sex with me, Im a male and shes a female?"
Your twisted logic can't hide the fact that tricking a Patient into being tested is completely unethical.,Come on. Don't you think she deserves to know why her husband won't bend her over the kitchen counter? You love all that caring crap.,"How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group."
You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart. You're not Even doing this out of medical curiosity.,I thought I made it clear I'm doing it for the cash.,"Okay, for the record what youre doing is really creepy."
"Two people are happy, and your natural impulse is to destroy it.",How do you know she's happy? Did she tell you?,"And now youve got them both working towards the same goal, the goal youve worked towards your entire life."
"No, Parkrping birds flew out of her butt carrying a banner.","All right, I admit that my natural impulse is to doubt peoples' claims to happiness, but yours is to be a sucker for them.","Yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it."
"Vomiting, liver, kidneys, and now fEver.","I don't want to tell you how to do your job, Dr.","No. No, no. She doesnt want to see you right now."
Get to the point.,The word fEver.,Lets get to it.
The hypothermia could've caused cell necrosis.,"TTP was the diagnosis when he walked out. FEver's a little high, but it still fits. We should continue plasmapheresis.",Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own.
We're missing symptoms. We should add language loss and aggression.,Should we also add forgetfulness? He's got Alzheimer's.,Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
We've just been assuming.,Because the Patient's wife said he exhibited both for a year.,"Uh, Michael, he wasnt inferring, he was implying."
He's nEver hit her before or lost all his English. We have to consider any change since he's been admitted as relevant.,Have to? Do I need to pull out another card?,"For the record, that kid was a terrible choice."
Disseminated viral infection with encephalitis. Patient complained of a sore throat a few weeks ago.,Start him on Interferon.,"Oh, you know, Im just gonna, Im gonna hang out, work on my music."
"We married six months after I met him. A year after that, he started forgetting things. I've known my husband longer with his Alzheimer's than without. I've watched more of him disappear than I Ever got to know. I just can't do this anymore.",You lose.,I cant believe you married him.
Lowering his libido and causing erectile dysfunction.,"A year on dopamine agonists, and he'll be a sex-crazed creep just like the rest of us, completely fascinated by Susie Cooper.",You have any idea what thisll do for your sex life?
Hooray for us. We disproved his asexuality. We also pRobably ruined his life.,"He'll thank us. Then he'll doze off, and then in a couple hours, he'll thank us again. He sits down in front of Wilson.","Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I havent had intercourse with him in eight years."
It could destroy his identity. It's like a gay person being told they're really straight.,So don't tell him.,Absolutely. Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
"Yeah, why bother telling a guy he has a tumor growing in his head? He'll notice it Eventually, when it starts leaking out his ears.",It's a slow-growing tumor. He'll pRobably die of boredom long before that.,"Wow. Yknow it is so weird. I mean, youre gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea whats gonna happen."
You always do this. You you meddle and force me into impossible situations.,You knew the second you told me about this case that I'd get involved.,"Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now."
"You played me. This whole thing was about your ankle monitor. You weren't trying to undermine my confidence you were trying to inflate it. You Manufactured conflict with me so Eventually you could let me win. Getting angry You knew it was encephalitis, but you waited for me to say it because then with my ego boosted, you thought I'd be in the mood to take off your monitor because I'd think I could control you.",You're right.,It meant nothing!
She pulls Foreman aways just as House shocks Andres. Clear.,He's back.,"Chandlers Office, Chandler Nina are locked in a passionate embrace."
Clear. He's back.,"I sure hope this Alzheimer's drug trial is worth a lot to this hospital, 'cause we're wasting a crap-load of time and Manpower just to let this guy watch his",Correction we dont care.
"Given his abnormal mental status, not necessarily.","Dr. Foreman, would you please reach under your chair?","Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature."
There's just wet gum under here. Where's the card?,What card?,"Believe me, if I got that card?"
I'm happy to leave if you have a better theory than aseptic meningitis.,Toxins. This guy went on walkabout. Chances are he's done it before.,"No, I dont think I picked her up."
Wife keeps the doors on the House locked.,Plenty of nasty stuff to get into during the middle of the night.,"Im trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?"
We asked about toxins on the history. The wife said she was sure to clear the House for her husband's safety.,I'm sure she succeeded.,A THING OR TWO ABOUT.
Stop. You're not infallible. You were wrong about encephalitis.,Just before you were.,Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didnt correct him?
Run CSF tests. Find out what's causing the meningitis.,You said you weren't gonna overrule me diagnostically.,"So, how did it go with Lesley?"
"And you said I wouldn't be able to help it. Apparently, you were right about that one. Foreman leaves the room.",Fine. I'll look for toxins myself.,"Alright, Sheldon, lets just calm down and well call the building manager, hell come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while youre waiting."
You can't go to their House without Foreman's permission.,Don't need it. I'll talk to the toxicology PhD upstairs. He also leaves.,"I know, but theyre tenting his building."
Don't need it. I'll talk to the toxicology PhD upstairs. He also leaves.,What about gifts from South America? Anyone send any fruits or vegetables?,"Oh please, you dont even have a PhD."
"I don't think so, no. Barraco azul!",I'm gonna need your boyfriend to collect samples of plants in and around your House. Toxins are the most!,"Oh you dont, thats"
"Wait, you understand him? What's he saying?","He's he's repeating, blue shack. You know what that is? Is it somewhere where pesticides may be kept?","Oh, I know what hes saying, and hes not, hes not funny."
It's where we had our first date.,Do you have a cleaning lady who might bring her own supplies?,Yes that was a nice place!
What's he saying?,"If it's not relevant to the case, I don't care. And neither should you.","I know what you guys are all thinking right now Hey, lets go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what?"
What did he say?,He asked who you were. She looks a bit disappointed. Don't get your hopes up. Have your boyfriend give me those samples.,"Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me."
It's Reye's syndrome. Patient had a sore throat a few weeks ago before he was admitted.,Reye's in adults is a reach.,"Aw, its so nice."
Not if he took aspirin.,Aspirin in adults is a reach. Especially in a House with locked medicine cabinets.,I dont need anything at the Galleria.
Wasn't in the medicine cabinet. Wife used to run a floral company. Still does a few orders from home. She uses crushed aspirin in the water to make the flowers last longer.,"So the husband has a sore throat, takes an aspirin without her knowing, realizes he's got a sore throat, takes an aspirin, realizes he's got a sore throat!","Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals."
Have Chase start him on steroids. Already did.,Then why're you telling me?,"Somethings got to be done about him, Leonard."
MRI confirmed macroprolactinoma. He's doing the treatment.,And the wife?,"Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident."
And the wife?,Come on. You saved a Man's life. Course-corrected two peoples' wildly screwed-up world views. It's not bad for a day's work.,"Thats the thing about debating, youre just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place."
We can't smoke in here. He sits down beside House and also uses the flame to light his cigar.,We also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet. And yet it happens. It's an imperfect world.,"Sir! Sir, you cant smoke that in here. Put it, put it out."
We also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet. And yet it happens. It's an imperfect world.,Well?,"The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they cant, would be because they could, which they cant."
Now get out. I have work to do.,Whoops.,Now get out.
I have work to do. Whoops.,How long has your daughter had trouble breathing?,"Oh, I gotta get back to work."
About a week now.,The best dads wait two or more.,Over a month.
"Yeah, no, it's not like it's serious. I-I checked online, and it's! asthma or something.",Or something is the number one killer of teens with no medical degree. When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?, Ill take the kid.
"Uh, like five months ago. We went a clinic in Trenton. I had strep throat.",You remember the antibiotic they gave you? Is it neomycin?,"Last week. Im sorry, I shouldve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please dont be too disappointed."
"Amoxicillin. House nods slightly. She passed that test. So about the inhaler for my asthma, I was",Sorry!,I feel great.
to her faux-father Let's get out of here.,"Since you're the brains of the operation, might wanna stick around.","All right, weve got to tell her hes gone."
"What, so I can get busted by Social Services?","No, so you can stop bleeding out of your ear.",Do it. Theyll find us if you dont.
Someone been using your head as a soccer ball? No.,"Much as I'd like to take your word for it, I have no interest in taking your word for it.",Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
Would you - would you tell me what's going on? What's wrong with me?,I have no idea.,"Okay, whats going on?"
Why'd you ask to meet us 30 miles away from the hospital?,"picks up his right leg, plops it on the table and pulls up the pant leg to show his monitor-less ankle Because I can.","Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then were gonna go see the baby."
CT confirms no skull fracture. And looking at her confirms she's not 18.,"Yes, she is. Says so in the file.",Did she look 16?
We can't treat an underage Patient without a guardian. We need to call Social Services.,"I cut a deal with the Patient. We don't call, she doesn't bolt.","Alright everybody, you are doing great!"
checking the file No sign of malnutrition. Tox screen is clear. S.T.D. panel was negative. looking toward the door And! is that Foreman?,"Oh, my goodness, it is!","That cant be nothing, the check engine light is on."
"She's a pharmaceutical rep, and this is a working breakfast.",In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.,I thought we were getting breakfast before work.
Would explain the lack of fEver. Pneumococcus is pretty common among the homeless population. We should find out if she's been vaccinated.,"Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything, start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.","Besides, it takes the focus off the hat."
And if she says she has been vaccinated?,"Then don't beliEve her, and start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.",What if its a girl?
How about we don't beliEve she's gonna bolt and we call Social Services?,"While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea.","When I go back to work, were gonna leave her with these people."
The bathroom's that way.,Pretty sure there's one in the hospital.,"Its so much closer to the bathroom, right?"
"bad southern accent Hello, good sir. My brother, the General here, gots the green-apple quickstep.","One of us is in the wrong time zone. And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order.","Whoa. Whats this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This heres Savannah."
"Well, he got the runs, and we do need him up and at 'em for battle tomorrow.","It's hardly authentic, coming to a newfangled clinic, especially with a Yankee doctor.",Okay. Its zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Lets get this bad boy on the road.
"Sir, are you questioning my resolve?","Yes, and your sanity. I'm multitasking.",Are you refusing to obey my order?
"Uh, General! Don't light out. We swore that we would see the elephant together.","Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs and their elephant.",Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking?
I don't think so.,"So! What causes an ear bleed, breathing pRoblems, and our runaway's inability to run away?",That town is full of history!
Fungal infection's off the table. What about transverse myelitis?,Not with normal posterior column function.,"Well, uh yknow, our guy works with Chandler and hes really nice and smart and hes a great dresser!"
We didn't call Social Services before because we didn't want the Patient to take off. Now she can't. There's no reason for us not to call.,"Well, how about the reason that there's no reason?",You realize they called when you took her.
"You want to protect her because you think she's fine on her own, outside the system.",Does anyone have a position on our Patient's medical condition?,"All right, everyone calm down!"
Could be endocarditis with septic emboli.,"Pull! another miss to Taub I'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently I'd miss. There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes.","No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldnt I be happy for you?"
"You've nEver done this before, have you?","No, I have not. But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't.",You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow.
"But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't. Vasculitis fits.","nods Start treatment with steroids. She's lucky, she'll be free to flee again.","well, why dont you tell them?"
Not once I call Social Services. I'm not giving up.,"You wanna bet? shows her a shotgun shell One shot, one birdie. You hit, you make the call. You miss, nEver mention it again.","The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!"
No. Why would I agree?,'Cause your only other option is you call and I fire you.,"No, you can have your own opinion."
Hiring a hooker to pretend to be a social worker?,"She took a bet that she knew she'd win. Frankly, I feel violated.","Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do."
"Apparently, someone identifying themselves as Dr. Pujols called and said the Patient ran off.",giggles Come on. Poo holes.,The giant must have took him.
You should have told me you were treating an underage clinic Patient.,I was giving you the gift of deniability.,"Challenge number two, protocol."
Now I'm giving you the gift of additional clinic hours.,"smug No, you're not.","Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate."
smug-er You've got nothing on me. Check your phone.,Uh!,Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.
"I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House.","Oh, of course not.","Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, softpenised debutante."
"Oh, of course not. There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip. But what about compromising it in a minor way? Reduced clinic hours. Unlimited Internet porn budget. That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives. You can keep these. I got copies. leaves",How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the Man.,"Oh, so now I need your permission?"
Adams is right. You're protecting this girl.,"sniffs again No, I was wrong. It's the stench of moralizing. I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents.",Shes right. Shes right. You are no different than the rest of them.
"You admire this girl. She had a horrible home life, so she went out on her own. She's your road not taken.",I've always dreamed of living in an abandoned House with mold.,She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
"House, all I'm accusing you of is having a connection with a Patient. This is a good thing.","It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing.",Youre a mean one Mr.
We need help in here!,Go!,Help! Somebody help!
You bet 100 bucks on a turtle race?,I paid Mr. Parkps 5 bucks to take a dive.,"Okay, Id like ten bucks on those odds."
"Diagnosis depends on whether the blood was coming from the sinuses, lungs, or her guts. Mr. Parkps has wandered away from the center circle. Mr. Parkps looks like he wants it. 100 bucks says he'll make soup out of Franklin.",You're on.,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away.
How'd the mom seem to you?,"If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron.",Hey. Howd it go last night with my mom?
"Acid reflux causes asthma, and the acid erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding. Yes!",Franklin rules.,"Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game."
Ellen shouldn't have consent if she beat her daughter.,Doesn't matter if she beat her daughter. Only matters if Social Services says she beat her daughter. Good thing you made it all official.,"Ah, interesting, were being accused of making you do things you dont like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy."
Not initially. It was a pretty tough conversation. Neither of us is ready,You didn't need to shoot yourself. I could have given you a Section 8.,No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.
"in a Yankee accent We've hit the drills pretty hard, and by the fourth round, my hand went numb. The-the gun slipped and I only had blanks in it, but!",It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.,I cant shoot with one hand.
Ah. Yeah. Sorry about that. Sheldon's a! progressive.,Eh compared to who? Rupert Murdoch?,"Im sorry, just one more question about Sheldon."
Progressives are reenactors who strive for complete authenticity. They nEver drop character while in uniform.,Whereas you just dabble in crazy.,Youre still swineherds and tanners and masons.
"sighs Sheldon and I had a big falling out years ago. We only really started talking again because of the reenactments. They, uh! gave me my brother back.",That's a very moving story. Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't bonded over something so completely idiotic.,"Oh, God, I dont know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?"
Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.,"joining them If only it would explain why we've nEver seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing.","No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didnt want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?"
It's been mildly elevated.,Mildly elevated BP could put her at risk of a Berry aneurysm.,Wow. Things are really picking up.
CT didn't show any signs of an aneurysm.,"Did I mention they come and go? Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.",You must be freezing.
Alcoholism and Berry aneurysm are both valid theories. I think we should discuss this with the Patient and her mom.,"Why? We discussed it right here. Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram to loCate the aneurysm, then surgery to repair.","Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now!"
The Patient asked me what I thought.,"I pay you to think inside this room. Outside this room, I pay you to parrot.",We should have you checked for a concussion.
It's her choice. She has the right to know!,It's a medical choice that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers.,"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!"
You think she wants to feel responsible for her daughter's illness?,That Woman sees Everything to do with her daughter through! guilt-colored glasses. It's all her fault. He exhales loudly then starts to leave.,Why dont we talk more about it instead of doing it?
House! don't! bully her. She's overwhelmed enough.,"Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat.","Uhhuh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I dont have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy."
You must be Dr. House.,I save my appearances for when parents are on the brink of doing something incredibly stupid.,"Son of a bitch, its five and a half."
"Well, I can't just leave this up to her.","Then leave it up to me, and just leave.","Wait a minute, I cant give this to her."
Ohh. I'm not gonna abandon my daughter.,She hates you.,"Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!"
It's a little late for that. Good night.,Morning!,Okay. Good night.
I heard you went head-to-head with the mom.,Not for your reasons.,Mother said you fought in a battle.
You're protecting the girl.,I'm protecting my diagnosis.,"The girl is innocent, Your Grace."
And you tested her see if you could get her back on drugs and out of her daughter's life.,That was to show Adams that Mommie Dearest hadn't changed. I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.,"Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?"
"Your Patient's stable? Well, maybe Adams was right. The illness is alcohol-related.","Well, I hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for.","You know, if anything, hes turning me into his mother."
You-you hope you're wrong for the sake of the Patient?,I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her.,"Nono! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think IIwould youactually, would you go check on that?"
"still in character But all the menfolk been eatin' it, and we the only ones that's sick.",Which one of you is the cheap bastard?,"Weve got the groundup flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew."
Because they don't cost anything.,"Brother against brother. Now, that is authentic.",They ought to be because they cost enough.
Get me a micro-vascular clip tray as well as the occlusion.,on speaker from the observation deck Check the ventricles.,"All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31."
Ventricles are clear too.,Aneurysm must have leaked instead of burst. Inject the dye.,You dont have to leave.
Her BP's dropping. Start her on pressors. We gotta get her BP up before her organs start shutting down.,Adams! with me.,"No, no, Im relieved."
"She got a little better when we put her on steroids, which can attack tumor cells. Maybe she has cancer.","No hypercalcemia, no elevated blood proteins.","Wow, it seems serious."
She and her mom mentioned a trip they took to Florida a couple years ago what about dengue fEver? Cholera?,"Great ideas, if dengue fEver or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly!",Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
"Great ideas, if dengue fEver or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly!",Did your biological daughter go swimming in Florida? In a lake or a pond or an Everglade?,"No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?"
Uh!yeah. There's a canal near my mother's House. Do you know what's wrong with her?,Family vacations kill. He heads into the O.R. Come with me. Don't want to explain this twice.,Does the well lead to an underground river?
You're letting in the flies. And she needs an LVAD.,"No, she doesn't.","Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle."
"Callie agrees with you! that people don't change. She said when her mom slips again, she didn't want to be there. She'd rather remember her like she is now.",Smart girl.,"Well, Im not sure."
You got the ending you wanted.,"'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives.","Um, it did end happy for you."
This is Mark Sanchez. Do you know what sound people make about him? Pffftt! He blows a raspberry.,Working late? Husband have her tonight?,Someone wake up Sanchez.
And Every night. She broke it off. It's for the best. I'm not really an affair guy after all.,"Sure you are, buddy.",Now that she broke up with you?
"I'm not like you, House.",True. No limp.,"Im not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon."
"Let the record show that we are officially convening a disciplinary hearing regarding the Events of February 3, 2012 in Patient room 209. Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed and published along with all supporting documentation and rulings. Do you have any questions before we get started?",Yeah. Who the hell are you?,Ive asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
"I'm Walter Cofield, Parkef of Neurology, Mercy Hospital. I'll be deciding your fate today.",Cofield.,Im sorry things turned out this way.
"This hearing isn't about me, Dr. House. I know you'd like to make it about me, because then it wouldn't be about you.",It's interesting that he'd pick the old mentor to Judge the new one.,"Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me."
"Interesting, but not relevant. The facts of this case, on the other hand","interrupting The facts are in the file. If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call. I'm going back to work.","Yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
"If I just consider the file, the facts aren't in your favor. The facts say you should be suspended, which, from what I understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.",The Patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher. He collapsed while out jogging. He was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans!,You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!
Show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.,Put out an APB for a car with a Man-shaped dent in the grill?,Why do you have to make everything so filthy?
"No broken bones, no signs of trauma.",Transverse myelitis. Boring.,"Not such a fascinating story, Im afraid."
No enhancement on the MRI. I just don't know what to do. pleading Please. You have to help me solve this thing.,A little poetic license. He takes some Vicodin.,"Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around."
What are you doing?,Taking my Vic-amins.,It is important to me.
Those are Vicodin? Did you have surgery recently?,About a decade ago. My leg is no good at judging time.,"Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them."
Were you taking Vicodin during this case?,Uhh!,"Yes, while I was in the chair!"
"And when bad things happen, we should figure out what went wrong, so we can learn from it and correct it.",So that we can assign blame instead of recognizing that bad things sometimes happen. It was nobody's fault.,"Well, you see, thethe thing is, wewe only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right."
And then what happened?,"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. Those who can't teach, teach gym. Those who can't move their arms or legs teach us to laugh at others.","But, if you need to get in touch with her immediately, you could talk to A."
And why did House think that was stupid?,"Oh, come on. Unless you're an idiot, you know why I thought Park was an idiot.","I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?"
looks at Patient file The Patient had low opening pressure on his LP.,That's what I said.,"Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?"
That's what I said.,"No, you idiot. The Patient had low opening pressure on his LP. Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time.","Well umm, if you have sometime yknow and maybe you might want to visit someone else"
Are you intentionally trying to get me to dislike you?,That wasn't me. The chair squeaked.,"No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever."
"You're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes? It's not the place to exorcise your guilt just b",I actually used the phrasing enunciating clearly into the recorder unsquint your eyes.,Do you deny all of the charges against you?
EKG was normal.,"But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point. The guy's potassium is off. Could be thyrotoxic paralysis. Start him on!","Well, not right now."
"But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point. The guy's potassium is off. Could be thyrotoxic paralysis. Start him on!","!steroids, PTU, and beta blockers.","OK, you know what, I dont think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and Im just going to get rid of all of that, so."
Mm-hmm. And how did these orange smudges get on the Patient files?,"Seriously? That's your follow-up? I eat a lot of Cheetos, I forget to wash my hands. Is my snacking really relevant to this case?",What happened to all your glowinthedarkemergencyexit stuff you had painted on the floor?
"What are they? Seriously, House?",You're blaming me? You used Adams' shampoo.,Howard and Bernadettes living room.
calmly I didn't do it.,It was a harmless prank. My team is made up of Type A personalities. They need something to break the tension Every once in a while.,Yeah. Just to be sure Im gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Sounds like a very diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.,"That's also true. Either way, I'm covered. If you want an accurate Patient history, don't Ever talk to the Patient. Everybody lies. Except me. To you. Would nEver do that.","Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so Im gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word puppy."
"Okay. Say you're right. If you had actually been in the room, questioning the Patient, you could read body language, you could ask follow-up questions, warn him of the costs of lying to you.",Don't forget the thumbscrews.,There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying.
"Looks like you've gone viral, hon.","He had a loss of consciousness, temporary paralysis! But when I was told the Patient coughed up blood, then things really started to get interesting.","Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread."
"Your Patient was doubled over in pain and coughing up blood, and you found that interesting?","Why, is that bad?",Its exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
"He smacked his head against the wall. If that caused swelling in his brainstem, that would have led to Eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.",muffled Nobody move.,"Well, Ill come with you."
But House found it. Mm-hmm.,You can leave when I have an answer.,"Hey Dwight, he found it."
"through his lab coat sleEve, which he is holding to his nose and mouth It might help if we knew the question.",How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?,From an orangutan in the primate lab.
speaking quickly with the front of her blouse pulled up over her nose Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar lavage to wash 'em out with water.,Sorry. My fault. Should have clarified. How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the Patient?,"Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off."
hands cupped over her mouth and nose Silver sulfadiazine works well on chemical burns.,Burn cream would drown him faster than water. waves stink bomb Well?,You look like youre in agony.
temporarily parting the lapels of his lab coat and sticking his head up Aerosolized heparin.,Me likey.,What the hell is that dog doing here?
But that's only experimental. It's nEver actually been used before.,Not true.,"Well, technically, this would be an alpha test."
It's nEver actually been used before. Not true.,Been used in sheep.,"Oh. Huh. Its huh, well its oh itsew used. Umm, cool."
Been used in sheep. Uh-huh.,The guy was going downhill fast. We needed a treatment that was a! slope changer.,Have you ever tasted a Shepherds Crook?
So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?,It was a team-building exercise.,Didnt you say youre making hydrogen sulphide gas?
No. It was Manipulation. You were pressuring your team into coming up with unsafe medical ideas just to get out of that room.,"You say pressure, I say inspire. The usual safe ideas were not gonna work. Aerosolized heparin might.",No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
How does Dr. House handle it when three smart doctors come up with three different but equally valid ideas?,I run a diagnostic trial.,"Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room."
I run a diagnostic trial.,Start the Patient on high-dose steroids.,"Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab."
"Start the Patient on high-dose steroids. Multiple birds, single stone. If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured. If Adams is right, he'll spike a fEver, get hypotensive, we can treat it. He can walk out of here cured. If Park is right, he goes all cuckoo's nest on us, we can cross brain off the list!","!diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.","Please, Im an MITtrained engineer."
"Are you trying to make this easy for me? By your own admission, if you give the Patient steroids, two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.",What was making the Patient worse was not having a diagnosis. This was the fastest way to get it. It was a perfect diagnostic moment.,That is an excellent question.
"In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?",Yes. My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes. Cofield raises one eyebrow. It did not account for the disobEdience of my own team.,I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
So your position is that your team's disobEdience caused this?,That's not what I said.,No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. Its not...
"You said you didn't anticipate their defiance. You implied that all would have been fine otherwise. So who do you blame, Dr. Adams or Dr. Chase? Or both?",I don't blame either one.,Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
"Got to move it, people.",My diagnostic test worked. It proved the Patient had a steroid-induced psychosis.,"Come on, on your feet, now."
And that's what you took away from this situation?,The brain was not a symptom of an underlying disease.,So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
Your colleague was stabbed. Are you telling me you didn't care?,How bad is it?,"Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat."
I can't take my finger out. He'll bleed. I don't think he can take it.,Oxygenation's at 100%. He's as ready as he's gonna be.,"Oh, I cant believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers."
Patch is holding.,What was his heart rate?,Youre not wearing the patch yet.
He doesn't have one. He's on bypass.,Not Chase. The Patient.,"And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board."
in disbelief You're DDX-ing?,"Park, come with me. Taub's got this.",You see what happens when you let girls play DD?
My friend is here because you didn't listen to me.,I did listen to you.,"Youre not my friend, my friend."
"Adams, he endangered himself, and he endangered the Patient. Thank you.","Lungs, rash, now excessive RR variability. Go.",I dont know.
It's a hospital. There are lots of doctors who can take care of him.,"And your thinking is that only you guys are qualified to sit in this room, doing nothing?","Its just the four digits, month and day."
She's not pregnant.,Would it make a difference? 'Cause I could knock her up. Autonomic dysregulation.,"Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincys theory."
"I don't think it was anyone's fault. I was angry, but I wasn't distracted. And I think that, if there's any chance I'm gonna walk again, it's because Dr. House is a genius.",How about warmth? Can you feel the sheets on your skin?,"Well, he, Michael Scarn, that character, orders people around, and thats, you should of just gone"
That'd mean the damage was perManent.,No. turns back Forget the nerves.,So if it breaks thered be none of it?
"House, if it's total paralysis, he must have!",Not necessarily. Think arteries. Blood flow to his spinal column is cut off. It's a clot in the radicular artery.,"But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard."
That could be fixable.,Prep a room for an embolectomy. Let's get that thing out of there before it does any more damage.,"Well, maybe we can put the box back together."
And if it's not a clot?,Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.,"Oh Joey, Im hardly a"
Don't get too excited. We still got to get it out. Still could have done perManent damage.,Patient does not have autonomic dysregulation. There's blood in his urine bag. Kidneys are failing.,"Yeah... Well, its a good thing we got it then."
"House, not now.",Got to be now.,"Oh, no, no, no."
This will be our last round of questions. I've spoken with Dr. Chase. You know he regained movement.,No.,Walk with me.
Are you really this indifferent to the fact that Dr. Chase is hurt?,"We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?","No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, lets go Blinky! Chandler!!!!"
Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry!,I didn't do anything wrong.,"Yknow, he wont even talk to me."
"It's not an admission of guilt. He's your friend, and he's not well.",He's a coworker.,Its not my friend.
Coworker whom you've known for almost ten years who nearly died and who's still scared he may not walk.,Are you going to have me fired for bad Manners?,The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
"Just trying to understand you. Why a Man in your position, with your abilities, is incapable of shaking the impulse to act like an ass.",pulling a Vicodin bottle from his pocket Could we go back on the record and get this over with?,"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, Wow, he is so great."
"Put the Vicodin away, Dr. House.",My leg hurts.,"Penny, rub Vicks on my chest."
brushing Vicodin off his papers Is that supposed to be funny?,Two explosions.,"Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny."
We're not done here.,"Hey, hold on.",Im not done with you yet.
"Hey, hold on.",Take him out of there.,"Hey, wait up."
Take him out of there.,Hey!,Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.
Take him out of there. Hey!,Wait. catParkng up with her Wait.,II cant go in there.
I have to get to my car. I don't! I n,Your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.,I I have to get on the plane.
You've been wrong Every time.,"Yeah, well, not this time.",Okay. Every time.
What about the psychotic break?,Turns out we caused that.,How about that?
"Move your cane, please.",Where's Cofield?,"Sir, please step away from your desk."
He said you walked out.,"Well, I'm walking back. I'm not done testifying.","Oh, that happened right after you left."
This case is a fiasco. Didn't sleep last night. pause Dr. House is obviously brilliant!,"Well, I think we've heard enough.",I could not agree more.
"I know. I came to speak with Dr. House. And when they told me he was in here, I thought I should say something. I mean! he wasn't the nicest doctor I've Ever met.","Well, I think we've heard enough.","That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?"
"As I was saying, Dr. House's process is dangerous, inappropriate. But he is effective. I've decided that I would be doing this hospital a disservice if I did anything to change that process. House stares at him. Congratulations, Dr. House. This unfortunate stabbing incident is officially nobody's fault.",Coward.,Well do it quickly.
Coward. Excuse me?,"You've got, like, 20 pages of notes there.","Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
"You were gonna send me back to prison. House, stop.",Good things usually happen Bad things sometimes happen.,"Oh, theythey sent me home."
"Good things usually happen Bad things sometimes happen. The fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing.",How'd you get the firing wire into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?,"Really? Well, it seems to me if youd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!"
Why'd I Even have to? What was the point of the orange hair?,Your hair smelled like Adams.,You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
You couldn't just ask me to stop being late?,What fun would that be?,"Okay, you could just show up late though."
"None of this is fun, House.",They decided that your being stabbed! was nobody's fault. long pause. Chase is listening. They're wrong. I'm sorry.,This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
Anything else? I'm kind of busy.,No. That was it.,Oh yeah. What else you got?
I was stabbed by a Patient. That'll teach me to overbill.,"seeing Cindy If she likes crippled guys, I'm free for the next six minutes.","Someday Ill, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop."
What do you want?,"45 year-old truck driver, recurrent seizures. No metabolic or structural!","All right, I think Im gonna head out."
interrupting Does this look like a good time?,Sort of. At least as good as the other 12 times that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.,"Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. Were having a party."
Those times I just didn't feel like talking to you. Kinda like now.,"I'd apologize again, but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one. he pauses You do work for me. I am entitled to ask when you're coming back.","Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didnt work out."
Stress test too. It's not angina. So why the shoulder pain?,"entering the room with Taub, Adams, and Park Is it possible that she hurt her shoulder?","Okay. Roberts in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?"
I didn't tell him.,to Wilson You were cagey about where you were going.,Then we shouldnt tell him.
Good to see you on your feet.,he has picked up the Patient file Patient's a nun? You turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?,"Chandler and Joeys, Joey, Ross, Monica, and now Chandler are still playing catch."
She was next up in the clinic. taking the file from House And I don't want your help.,You got stabbed. You blame me.,"The problem is, though, after the concerts over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, yknow?"
You got stabbed. You blame me.,But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?,Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
Maybe I was an idiot before and I'm not one now.,Or maybe the rEverse is true.,Cause Im an idiot who didnt think this through.
looking back at Wilson Thanks for all your help.,leaning in close Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads.

Not a fungal infection.,"You're pRobably wondering, why the soda balloons?","Hi! So Im out having lunch at Monicas and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdales and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and hes gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!"
"You're pRobably wondering, why the soda balloons? I'm not.","Well, I'll tell you. You're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control when you got knifed in the ventricle. Taub has decided!","No! No, of course not. No. Thats why I brought it up. They didnt have any sodas?"
interrupting I need help with my Patient. She's vomiting. That's not from a fungal infection.,What are you planning to do now that you're not working for me?,"Good luck Michael, I hope you find what youre looking for."
I have no idea. Almost dying's been clarifying. I can do anything.,You can do anything. So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years. Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.,I see. Have you considered therapy?
Can we get to my Patient sometime soon?,"As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.","No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, Im in a rut, lets shake things up."

"Okay, I'm curious.",Your overreaction to your stabbing is to blame me Even as you are drawn to me. Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes that won't defend him against anything.,Shouldve put him out of his misery and just fired her.
Krav Maga. Which helped me block your shot and will continue to help me defend myself in a building full of drugged-up strangers.,"Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.","Yeah.

You're already on your fifth. You got Evans at Mercy, Shaw at County, Foster at Johns Hopkins. And Every one of them has given you the same advice. You're nuts. You don't just want chemo. You want a dose so high, there's a one-in-three chance it'll kill you outright. Question is, why didn't you tell me? Because you knew I'd stop you. Which means you've already found someone insane enough or desperate enough to give you what amounts to a death dose of chemicals. House wanders back behind Wilson's desk But who would be that stupid? I'm thinking that the who, is you.",holding up the bag Where exactly were you planning on killing yourself? 'Cause I don't think Foreman is gonna let you do it here.,"Oh, well, then good!"
No. No! Stop. trying to explain I'm still healthy.

"Friends respect each other's decisions, Even if they don't agree with them. It's called loyalty.",Loyalty is a tool to get people to do things they don't wanna do.,Uh huh. But theyre not your friends anymore.
"But you do want to. You may have rationalized it a hundred different ways, but the fact is, you fired me so that I'd be forced to spend the rest of my life doing exactly what I wanted to do. It was pRobably the most! selfless thing anyone has Ever done for me. And you don't Even like me that much.",I surrender. entering the office I have been a disloyal! disrespectful jerk. I should have listened to what you wanted.,"Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?"
I'm still not letting my parents return your call.,sitting down across from Wilson I made a reservation for two at Carmine's. Tonight. 800. No more tricks. No more Manipulations.,My parents called this afternoon to say they werent coming.
No more Manipulations. Said MaParkavelli.,Just! two friends enjoying the time they have left.,"Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked?"

"Well, he wasn't that smart. He left the Oreos behind.",You hiked for 32 miles eating nothing but creAmy filling.,And crisped them so no one would know.
The black stuff is overrated.,toasting with their Oreos To climbing the hill.,"Well, I dont take it black."

"No, I'm not, I'm just I do feel pretty good and I! Maybe I should try it for a little while.",carefully I! I think that's reasonable. He takes a sip of coffee,"I am. Oh, it, its fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that Ive gone without running into a mens room in, in, in years."

A decision that I just made for you! he sighs,"I need you, okay? I want you to be around as long as possible. 'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do without you.","Well, we dont really have to decide anything right now, do we?"

"House, get out of my car.",You don't have to just accept this.,Get in the car.
"Yes, I do have to accept this. I have five months to live, and you're making me go through this ALONE! he sobs I'm pissed because I'm dying, and it's not fair. And I need! I need a friend. I need to know that you're there. I needI need you to tell me that my life! was worthwhile, and I!

What are you doing back here?,"We got a case. Assume the status is, Patient's getting worse. You guys are confused.","Oh yeah. Well you cant fire Joseph. You know why, cause hes not in your department."
"You think actually showing up for work is enough to make up for ruining an MRI, endangering the Patient, injuring us?","I got an airtight alibi, that I'm working on.",I think you need to go a little easy.
This isn't about the damage. You're back because something's going on with Wilson.,I'm done with Wilson.,"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield."
You can't just abandon him.,It's in his hands now. Get any good pictures before the MRI drowned?,"Couldnt leave him one friend, could you?"

You quizzing us?,"Oh, this is a good quiz.",Are you asking me or telling me?
He'll scream in pain.,"Don't listen to her. Very small needle, very steady hand.","Butbut Cailin, he definitely will scream."
grimacing as House inserts the needle Ah!,"Now, when I pull back on the plunger, what do you think's gonna come out?","Aw. Somebodys ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right."
"Now, when I pull back on the plunger, what do you think's gonna come out? Air.","Boy, that air sure is red.","Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?"
You're being an ass.,continuing to walk down the hallway I just cured a Patient. How 'bout you?,"Ill feel better when Im there, and I can know where you are all the time."
You can't just give up on Wilson. You know he needs you. You know he's making an impossible choice. He just doesn't want to live in pain.,shouting Life is pain!,Fall back! Keep him safe!

Because you need me and! I don't think that's a bad thing anymore.,No.,Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
shaking his head Are you really okay that there's only five months left?,No. But it's better than nothing.,"Okay, I guess."
Um! How do we start?,I'm not gonna say I love you.,How shall we begin?
"pointing And this is the peak. Almost 8,000 feet.",You do realize that my leg situation has deteriorated a little since the last time we went hiking.,"Aye. Its a long way up and a long way down. But Ive waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down."
"This is Matt Johnson, the hospital Lawyer.",Yes. I have decided not to proceed with the sexual harassment case.,"That is Jim Halpert, he is the coregional manager of this office."

You might want to get up and start heading for the exit signs.,"For all I know, I already am up.",You missed the exit!
I was in a car accident last month.,I won a swimming trophy in high school. Your turn.,"Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack."
I-I ran out of pain medication. I got an orbital fracture. It's just taking ages to heal.,Take off your shirt. puts down the Patient file,"Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes!"
My eye's up here. points,"Orbital fracture means your face went into the windshield, which means your chest went into the steering wheel.",So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes.
How'd you know?,The codeine allergy you told the nurse about.,I have very fertile hair glands.
"The codeine allergy you told the nurse about. That's shorthand for give me the strong stuff, which matches your seen-better-days-because-my-life-fell-apart suit. The two old burns on your fingers mean you tend to nod off with a cigarette in your hand. No reason you shouldn't do that with one in your mouth. May all your doctors be stupid. Annoyed, Oliver grabs his jacket and tie, preparing to leave. Hold on a second. That bruising around your belly button. He examines the streaky, purple bruise extending for sEveral inches in each direction. Well, you might get some fun drugs out of this after all.","Cullen's sign. But the ultrasound showed air as well as blood. Now, I know what you're thinking. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis. But I also know what I'm thinking. Doesn't explain the pneuomoperitoneum.","Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and Im afraid even more sweating."
You ran tests yourself?,"I saw the chance to help someone in need, and I instinctively Oh, no, wait, that was someone else's instinct.","All right, next, were gonna introduce an anxietyinducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problemsolving rate."
Wilson is dying. Your parole Officer is pRobably on his way here right now. How are you possibly in a good mood?,Did you nEver see Dead Poets Society? Carpe diem.,"Hey, youre in a good mood."
"Blah. Blah, blah.",Nobody cares about the medicine. It was a perforated ulcer. Laparotomy to find the hole in his tummy and close it up.,"Okay, see now, what I just heard blahblahblah, blahblahblahblahblah, blahblahblah, blah, blah."
You didn't answer the team's question.,"Which is weird, because normally, when I talk to my own employees, I'm under oath and hooked up to a lie detector.","Well, thats too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct."
You were looking at six months of prison instead of five months of Wilson. Why happy?,Obviously I had a plan.,Youre angry with me.
"Obviously, obviously you had a plan. The more interesting question is why you didn't tell the team. I think it's because part of you knew from the start that the plan wouldn't work.",I need a meeting.,Why wasnt that Plan A?
I'm busy. Call my office.,reaParkng into his pocket Yes! because wobbly tables don't just unwobble themselves.,"Yeah Melissa, I dont want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor."
reaParkng into his pocket Yes! because wobbly tables don't just unwobble themselves.,I need a meeting.,"Yeah, theyre stuck inside the table!"
When is that not true?,"Well, right now, for one.",Thats also not true.
You're asking me to perjure myself.,"It's a tiny, white lie.","Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, yknow, the muscles in the siadic area can get yknow, real nice and tight."
Felony vandalism should have added another year or two to your sentence. It's a miracle the parole board agreed to six months.,"serious I will go to jail, Eventually. I will pay the price. I just rather that Wilson didn't. Come on, be a friend.","No, no. Three month probationary period. Lets not tell anybody about this right now."
Be a friend?,How Many fingers am I holding up?,You become friends after?
Why do you want to kill yourself?,"Well, here's a reason.","This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
You think that's the sum total of who you are? A doctor? A friend to Wilson?,I'm also a tremendous baritone. Now go away.,"And Im his friend, Dr."
Stop being an idiot.,"Can I have Kutner back, please?",Stop acting like an idiot!
How much pathetic wallowing do I have to sit through?,How are things in hell? Is the humidity the big issue?,"Honey, youre not pathetic, youre sad."
What happened next with the guy's medical case?,Why?,How was it resolved?
"Exactly. Why am I, meaning you, still obsessing about this case? Obviously we think it's relevant to why we're still sitting on the floor of a burning building.",There was a code.,Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
What are you doing? What did you give him?,Five! four! three! two!,Im giving him a peanut.
his eyes pop open and he flails at the doctors Ahhh! Arg!! Ahhh!,"Naloxone. We should've got suspicious when his visiting cousin signed in as Mr. Tar H. Horse. Heroin caused the respiratory distress. The naloxone turned off the receptors, caused your distress.","Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those transNeptunian objects, are we?"
shouting I'm not gonna stop doing drugs! It's reality that sucks!,You're saying I'm lying! to my subconscious?,I am mad that I cant huff enamel without people assuming its because my family sucks.
"People do it all the time. And like it or not, you are a person.",He said Every one of those things.,People do it all the time.
"But not then and not like that. This guy was going nuts from the naloxone. He couldn't be rational if you wanted him to be, which you did. Why?",I compressed the story a little,"I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour."
"jttpgyix matters. You nEver talk to Patients for non-diagnostic reasons, but this guy!",Feeling better?,A corridor at the university
I'm not gonna stop doing drugs.,"You were a stockbroker. Son of a stockbroker. Married, Parkldren.",I am gonna try and quit drinking.
I was miserable.,"Well, you say you were miserable because you need to rationalize screwing it up.",That must have been very upsetting for you.
"Except I didn't. I mean, I-I did. But I'm not miserable. Not anymore. House, fascinated, studies Oliver's faces as he talks. I had a ski injury and painkillers weren't enough, and a friend of mine gave me some heroin. The second it entered my veins, it was like! God had taken over my body. It was like there was no more pain or unhappiness in my life or anybody else's.",But then you lost Everything.,At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently.
Are you arguing that he's a good role model?,He's happy.,Are you saying that his contributions arent as valuable as yours?
You're stealing this guy's oxygen?,There's oxygen Everywhere.,Hes stealing them.
"You passed on all your cases, reassigned them to other doctors.",They weren't interesting.,You ought to try enjoying something before you die.
They were my reason for getting your sentence delayed!,"Yeah, well, I guess you'll have to tell the parole board something else.","Oh my. They really got to you, didnt they?"
You set me up.,Not really.,"Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure."
Why are you doing this? Why are you risking destroying yourself?,There's no risk. I know you. You'll do the honest thing. You'll lie.,"Hey, hey what are why are you doing this?"
You'll lie. No.,He's happy.,Go ahead. Dont lie.
You weren't worried.,Of course I was worried. My plan fell through.,I did not freak out.
"The plan didn't matter. Your plan to replace that plan didn't matter. Wilson didn't matter. Jail didn't matter. The only thing that mattered, the only thing that Ever mattered, was the puzzle.","I noticed a slight twitch in his thenar eminence, which meant! to Oliver You're dying.",There is one problem with this plan.
Because my thumb's a little shaky?,"Plus the thinning in the muscle, plus that speech you gave at Yankee Stadium saying you were the luckiest Man on the face of the earth.",Your thumb? Thats weird. You sure youre punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
Lou Gehrig's disease? You're trapped in your body you can't move or speak while you just die?,"If it makes you feel any better, at this rate, it'll be fast.",I often forget other people have limitations.

"No, you just skipped over a chunk of conversation.","He swore that he would live a better and more selfless life in his remaining time, blah, blah, blah. After two blahs, I'd heard enough. I moved to the door.","No, no, now that weve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you."

accepting his reason for editing his report Fair enough.,to Oliver You're not symmetrical. The veins on your right side are distended.,Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
What does that mean?,examining Oliver's neck There's a bulge in your superclavicular notch. There's something in there.,"717? Wheres 717? Hey, youve have more of these for Susan right?"
There's something in there. What?,"Well, I'm not that good a doctor. pulls over an ultrasound maParkne and checks Oliver's neck Good news your case is fascinating. And good news for you you're gonna live.",In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day.
"Well, I'm not that good a doctor. pulls over an ultrasound maParkne and checks Oliver's neck Good news your case is fascinating. And good news for you you're gonna live.","voice over You've inhaled a small branch, pRobably while you were realizing that it's all worth it, while you were passed out on a Park bench.",It wasnt bad advice.
voice over And it grew?,"voice over Not unless you also inhaled a chunk of the sun and a drip-irrigation system, you idiot.","She grows any more hair on her face, yes."
"Taub holds up a small piece of a fir branch, including the needles. You're smiling.","I was, and now I'm not. Because a moment's fun a few days ago does not trump a friend dying.","Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants."
"staring down at him Yeah, it does, you idiot. 'Cause after he's dead, you cry for a while, and then you go back to doing what you love.","Every Patient that I've had, 70 years from now, they'll all be as dead as Wilson. Everybody dies. It's meaningless.",When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind.
"What about God? You were leaving, and then you stopped. Why?","Your theory is I'm not leaving, because I beliEve in God? What, he's calling me home?",If you could get out that whole time why didnt you?
Maybe falling through that floor was a sign. Maybe that the universe hates you. Something. You really don't beliEve? Really? Not in some deep crack of some remote recess of some dark corner of your mind?,No. Except that some deep crack of some remote recess of some dark corner is here telling me,"Oh come on, we just need to be more creative."
"That's enough. In a burning building, facing imminent death, that's more than enough.",Pascal's wager is facile.,Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
"Saying it's facile is facile. Why is it wrong? He stares at her. Don't be logical, be desperate. You gotta have something to hold on to.",You can't live your life based on something you don't beliEve.,"Well III dont care how hot it is itsits uh, its wrong."
But you can end your life based on something you don't beliEve? What about love? I lived with you for years. I know you beliEve in love.,"Foreman wouldn't help me, which means I need you to take the fall.",I do believe my lords in love.
"You do remember I'm dying, right?","Which is you will nEver spend a day in jail. Fresh-faced, cancer-ridden. It's tough to do both, but you pull it off.","Oh God, ohh, okay, yknow what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?"
Your fingerprints are all over those hockey tickets.,I nEver admitted to flushing anything. My prints make sense if I gave those tickets to you as an incentive to stay alive.,"Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play."
"And I was so angry that you didn't respect my dying wishes, I took thousands of dollars of season tickets and flushed them down toilets?",All you have to do is create reasonable doubt.,"Oh, thats why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us?"

I knew I could count on you. Wait! Wait.,"stops, mouth full You want the fries back?",I was waiting for you.
I'm not gonna take the fall.,"Don't do this to me, Wilson. This is our only option.",I will take the fall.
"Exactly, because you overplayed your hand with Foreman, because you knew you had me as a backstop. Even with me dying, you-you just assumed I'd be here to bail you out.","Since you're here, and you are bailing me out, it seems like a pretty safe assumption.","Look Im very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but yknow, it couldve been a bullet and you yknow, you didnt try to save me!"
"Hey! I won't be here soon. If I do this, I'm teaParkng you that your bad behavior will always be rewarded. You need to learn","How to act when you're gone? 'Cause if that's the lesson, we got a really great opportunity coming up.",Ooh. Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy? Am I gonna get a spanking cause you know.

I don't hate you. I love you.,And yet you think I deserve to die.,"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
But not as a punishment. As a reward. I think! you've suffered enough. You've given enough. I think you deserve a chance to just! give up.,Like Wilson did?,Though it so often is what people deserve.
Just let go. Just go to sleep.,I had a chance to avoid this.,Just let go.
"You had Many chances, and you blew them all up.","No, this was different.","No, I dont think this was your shot."

You tried to save me.,I failed. Motives don't matter. Only actions.,"I went to save them, I failed."

I'm doing this because I have nothing left to lose.,"thinking through this puzzle So when you were living, you did nothing for anyone and you didn't care.","Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose."
What's your point? That you cared about him more than you cared about yourself? You cared about the puzzle more than you cared about yourself.,"If I kept it to myself, then it would just be a puzzle, but I opened my mouth because I thought it was more.","I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities."
"You know it's the same, or you wouldn't be bickering with me while the flames lick at your feet. You're afraid of this decision, and you are trying to argue until fate takes it out of your hands. You're taking the cowardly way out. And worse! you're too cowardly to Even admit you're taking the cowardly way out.",You're right. But I can change.,Can we just focus on the decision Im facing?
